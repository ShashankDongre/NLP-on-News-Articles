# NLP-on-News-Articles
This project, part of my data science coursework at Northeastern University, focuses on automating the extraction and analysis of real-time news articles from leading global sources such as BBC, CNN, and Fox News. The aim is to implement end-to-end data science techniques including web scraping, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and machine learning, culminating in interactive visualizations that provide actionable insights into global news trends and sentiments.
