Austin police chief knocks down 'rampant rumor' of serial killer in Texas capital,"The City Council approved the resolution after hearing testimony of family of loved ones who had disappeared or were found dead in Lady Bird Lake. A series of men found dead in downtown Austin who were roughly the same age and found in the same body of water are likely not the victims of a serial killer, according to the Texas capital's chief of police. Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said detectives suspected accidents or suicides in the recent string of deaths — but he left open the door should additional information become known to investigators. His statement comes as speculation that deaths in the city's Lady Bird Lake — four since February and double that over the past year — could have a connection. Of those, three were discovered near the edge of Rainey Street, a popular downtown strip, and a fourth was located about two miles downriver near a dam. BODIES STACK UP IN TEXAS CITY AMID FEARS OF SERIAL KILLER, RUMORS OF ‘ROOFIE’ ATTACKS Wooden fencing lines the edge of the trail between Rainey Street in downtown Austin and the Lady Bird Lake waterfront, where men have been discovered dead this year. (Matteo Cina/Fox News Digital) ""I realize that there is a rampant rumor about a potential serial killer here in Austin,"" Chacon told FOX 7 Austin. ""We've found no evidence of that."" ""Nothing has come to light that would indicate that there is a serial killer in Austin,"" the chief said. Police had a visible presence on Rainey Street over the weekend, out in force along the strip. City officials have also begun discussing ways to make the waterfront safer, including adding lights to the trails there and increasing Park Ranger patrols. They have also installed high temporary fencing. This undated photo is of Jason John, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Feb. 13, 2023. TEXAS SERIAL KILLER FEARS RISE AS LAKE DEATHS CLIMB TO 4 Austin police for weeks have said publicly that they have not uncovered evidence of foul play in any of the deaths, as their investigations continue. But many Austin residents, as well as independent investigators and web sleuths alike, have argued that the number of bodies found so close to one another is more than a coincidence, especially due to the distance between the strip of bars on Rainey Street and the waterfront itself. This undated photo is of Jonathan Honey, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Saturday, April 1, 2023. The edge of Lady Bird Lake is about a block and a half from the strip and requires climbing over a fence and down a trail. BANK ACCOUNTS OF NEW YORK ‘ROOFIE MURDER’ VICTIMS DRAINED VIA FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY Austin police identified the latest victim last week as John Christopher Hays-Clark, 30.

Police told Fox News Digital Monday his remains were located on the 500 block of Thompson Lane Thursday morning.

Idaho student murders: Bryan Kohberger defense claims surviving roommate has 'exculpatory' evidence,"Correspondent Dan Springer reports the latest from Seattle, Washington. A defense investigator working on behalf of University of Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger asserted in a newly unveiled court filing that a surviving housemate has ""exculpatory"" information that is ""material and necessary"" to the alleged killer's defense. Kohberger, a former criminology Ph.D. candidate, is accused of entering an off-campus home on Nov. 13 around 4 a.m., after the occupants, all undergrad students at the school, had been out on a Friday night into early Saturday morning. Police allege he fatally stabbed four of the six people inside, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, along with Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20. The three women lived there with the two survivors, while Chapin, Kernodle's boyfriend, was spending the night. Of the two survivors, one allegedly heard a commotion and witnessed a masked man exit through a rear sliding door, according to a police affidavit. IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS DISCLOSURE UNLIKELY TIED TO STUDENT STABBINGS: EXPERTS Madison Mogen, top left, smiles on the shoulders of her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves, as they pose with Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and two other housemates in Goncalves' final Instagram post, shared the day before the four students were stabbed to death. The blurred faces are those of the victims' two surviving housemates. (@kayleegoncalves/Instagram) The second, a Nevada native named in the Nevada court filing made public Monday, allegedly heard or saw things that could clear the suspect, according to Richard Bitonti, a defense investigator working for Anne Taylor, Kohberger's court-appointed attorney. In the documents, obtained by Fox News Digital, the subpoena demands the roommate's appearance on June 28, two days into Kohberger's planned preliminary hearing, and warns of a potential fine of $500 or 25 days in jail if she refuses to appear. ""During the course of my investigation, it became known to me that [she] has information material to the charges against Mr. Kohberger,"" Bitonti wrote in an affidavit in support of the subpoena, revealed Monday after online sleuths found the case listed on a Washoe County, Nevada, court docket. A portion of that information, Bitonti added, ""is exculpatory to the defendant."" IDAHO MURDERS: BRYAN KOHBERGER LEAKS ‘HUGE ISSUE’ WITH ‘POTENTIAL TO COMPROMISE’ PROSECUTION, LAWYER WARNS Bryan Kohberger enters a courtroom in Moscow, Idaho on Jan. 12, 2023, for a status hearing. The accused murderer waived his right to a quick preliminary hearing and will appear in court again on June 26. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) The ""information is unique to her experiences and cannot be provided by another witness,"" according to the documents. As a result, Kohberger's defense is asking the court to compel her testimony at his scheduled preliminary hearing in June, as they hope to challenge the probable cause used to justify his arrest. As Fox News Digital has reported, prosecutors can sidestep his attempts to disprove probable cause by seeking a grand jury indictment behind closed doors. ""If there is no preliminary hearing, because there was a superseding indictment, the issue of the subpoena (at least for that hearing) becomes moot,"" Edwina Elcox, a Boise-based criminal defense attorney who previously represented Lori Vallow, told Fox News Digital. Bryan Kohberger, who is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, looks on as his attorney, public defender Anne Taylor, speaks during a hearing in Latah County District Court, Jan. 5, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, Pool) Even if a grand jury is empaneled behind closed doors, without involvement from Kohberger's defense team, prosecutors would be ethically bound to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence, she said. However, a grand jury would enable prosecutors to present the case without subjecting any witnesses to harrowing cross-examination from Kohberger's defense before trial. ""The prosecutor has to present such exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, even though the defense is not present,"" she said. IDAHO MURDERS: PROSECUTOR SAYS VICTIM'S FAMILY ‘POTENTIAL WITNESSES’ AS DEFENSE OPPOSES GAG ORDER APPEAL The law firm representing the surviving roommate declined to comment, citing Idaho Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall's gag order on the case. Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall speaks during a status hearing for accused murderer Bryan Kohberger on Jan. 12, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) However, in a court filing opposing the subpoena, also published Monday, Reno-based attorney Kelli Anne Viloria argued that the Idaho subpoena was improperly filed and ""there is no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to Idaho for preliminary hearing."" ""There is also no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a hearing and there is no authority to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a Nevada judge making a finding of materiality, necessity and the lack of undue hardship,"" she added. IDAHO'S MOVE TO RESURRECT FIRING SQUAD ‘MAKES SENSE’ AS ‘QUICKEST, SUREST’ DEATH PENALTY OPTION, EXPERT SAYS State police investigators look for clues in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 21, 2022. Four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in the home a week earlier. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) At the time of the stabbings, Kohberger was a Ph.D. criminology student at Washington State University, a neighboring school less than 10 miles away from the Idaho campus. He finished out the semester and drove home, cross-country, with his dad riding shotgun. After his initial arrest, Kohberger's previous public defender in his home state of Pennsylvania said his client was looking forward to being exonerated. Taylor, his attorney in Idaho, ignored requests for comment from Fox News Digital prior to the gag order and has since remained silent. In court filings, her office has slammed what it calls ""grotesquely twisted"" media coverage of the home invasion stabbing that left four college students dead of multiple stab wounds each – some of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the start of the ambush. Defense attorney Anne Taylor joins investigators at a visit to the King Road crime scene on Jan. 3, 2023. Taylor is defending Bryan Kohberger, who is charged with four counts of first-degree murder. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) Experts have told Fox News Digital that they expect Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson to be extra careful as he seeks a conviction in the potential death penalty case in order to avoid possible grounds for appeal. Last month, he informed Judge Marshall and Kohberger's team that his office would be disclosing this week ""potential Brady/Giglio material"" related to a police officer involved in the massacre probe – but that doesn't mean there is a connection with the stabbings of four University of Idaho students in November. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Brady material is information that could potentially prove a defendant's innocence, experts tell Fox News Digital. Giglio material is damaging to the integrity of a witness – in this case, one of the officers involved in the investigation. In previously released court documents, investigators alleged they had linked the suspect to the crime scene through surveillance images of his car and phone records. They also found a knife sheath next to Mogen's body that allegedly contained DNA. Kohberger faces four counts of first-degree murder and another of felony burglary. His preliminary hearing is scheduled to begin on June 26 and could take several days. Fox News' Haley Chi-Sing contributed to this report. Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

"Gabby Petito update: Laundrie family attorney seeks copies of texts, calls","Security camera video from the Whole Foods in Jackson, Wyoming, shows Gabby Petito and her suspected killer, fiancé Brian Laundrie, browsing the shelves on Aug. 27, 2021 – the last date she was seen alive. The attorney for Brian Laundrie's family is seeking copies of all the family's texts, calls and other phone records for a six-month stretch of 2021 obtained by the parents of Gabby Petito as part of a Florida civil suit connected to the travel blogger's murder. Her parents' attorney, Pat Reilly, obtained a subpoena earlier this year asking AT&T for records of calls, texts and other phone data from Brian, Christopher and Roberta Laundrie between July 2, 2021, and Nov. 13 of that year. Petito's parents are alleging that the Laundries caused them emotional distress and attempted to help their son escape justice after he strangled and bludgeoned their daughter to death during a cross-country ""van life"" road trip. In December, they added Laundrie lawyer Steve Bertolino to the lawsuit in a second amended complaint, and he asked for copies of the AT&T records on Thursday.

"Texas judge delays inmate's execution as questions over evidence, testimony examined","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Texas judge has stopped next week's scheduled execution of a death row inmate who has long said he's innocent so there can be more time to review his claims that he was convicted more than 20 years ago with false testimony and questionable evidence. Ivan Cantu had been condemned for the fatal shooting of his cousin, James Mosqueda, 27, and his cousin’s girlfriend, Amy Kitchen, 22, during a November 2000 robbery at their north Dallas home. Cantu has long claimed he is innocent. Cantu, 49, had been set for execution April 26. But state District Judge Benjamin Smith in Collin County, where Cantu was convicted, on Wednesday withdrew the execution date, saying more review is needed of the inmate’s new claims. LONGTIME TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE CAN PURSUE DNA TESTING FOLLOWING DECISION BY SUPREME COURT Bill Wirskye, first assistant district attorney with the Collin County District Attorney’s Office, declined to comment. ""Because Mr. Cantu’s case raises troubling questions that undermine the integrity of the conviction, the court’s decision to withdraw the execution date to permit further review was the appropriate next step,"" Gena Bunn, Cantu’s attorney, said in a statement on Friday. Sylvia Cantu, Ivan Cantu’s mother, said she remains hopeful ""that all of this new evidence will finally be heard in court so that Ivan can come home."" Two of the jurors who convicted Cantu have submitted declarations stating they now have doubts about the case. Ivan Cantu's execution has been delayed as evidence and testimony that convicted him of the November 2000 murders of his cousin, James Mosqueda, and Amy Kitchen, Mosqueda's girlfriend, are reexamined. (Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP) ""I do not want the execution of Mr. Cantu to be carried out unless a careful and thorough review of the evidence is conducted,"" Maurice Jacob, one the jurors, wrote in declaration from earlier this month. Prosecutors have claimed Cantu, who was convicted in 2001, killed Mosqueda, who dealt illegal drugs, and Kitchen as he tried to steal cocaine, marijuana and cash from his cousin’s home. Cantu has claimed a rival drug dealer killed his cousin. In Cantu’s apartment, police found bloody jeans with the victims’ DNA, a key to the victims’ home and a key to Kitchen’s car. Police found Cantu’s gun at his ex-girlfriend’s home. Mosqueda’s blood was found on the gun’s barrel while Cantu’s fingerprints were found on the gun’s magazine. In a 2005 affidavit, Matthew Goeller, one of Cantu’s trial attorneys, said Cantu admitted to him ""that he had indeed killed Mosqueda for ‘ripping him off’ on a drug deal"" and that Kitchen was killed because she was a witness. Cantu’s then-girlfriend, Amy Boettcher, was the prosecution’s main witness. She testified Cantu told her he was going to kill Mosqueda and Kitchen and later took her back to the crime scene after the killings. But in court documents, Bunn alleges Boettcher’s testimony is riddled with false statements. Boettcher, who died in 2021, testified Cantu stole and later got rid of Mosqueda’s Rolex watch. But the watch wasn’t stolen and was later found by Mosqueda’s family, Bunn said. EXECUTION OF TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE WHO CUT OUT HIS EYES DELAYED AFTER CONCERNS ABOUT HIS MENTAL STATE Boettcher told jurors Cantu proposed to her on the night of the killings with an engagement ring he stole from Kitchen. But witnesses have since said Cantu and Boettcher had announced their engagement and showed off the ring a week before the killings, according to Bunn. Boettcher testified Cantu placed his bloody jeans and socks in their kitchen trashcan on the night of the killings. But Cantu’s lawyers have questioned this because a police officer who was in his apartment the next day did not see the bloody clothes in the trashcan and they weren’t discovered until several days later, supporting the defense’s theory that someone else put them in the trashcan. Jeff Boettcher, Amy’s brother, testified that prior to the killings, Cantu told him he planned to kill Mosqueda and Cantu had tried to recruit him to ""clean up"" afterward. However, Jeff Boettcher has since said he ""lied"" and was not a credible witness due to his history of drug abuse, according to court documents. ""Absent the largely unimpeached testimony of the Boettchers, it is unlikely that Mr. Cantu would have been convicted,"" Bunn said in court documents. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bunn has credited an independent probe by Matt Duff, a private investigator, with uncovering much of the new evidence in the case.

UConn student gets additional 55 years for killing man with sword,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Connecticut man who viciously and randomly attacked two people with a Samurai-style sword, killing one and severely wounding the other, was sentenced Thursday to 55 years in prison, the same sentence he received for a fatal shooting and kidnapping that occurred two days after the attack. Peter Manfredonia struck 62-year-old Ted DeMers in the head with the sword, completely severed his right hand, sliced off his left thumb and index finger and repeatedly slashed his back during the attack in Willington on May 22, 2020. Manfredonia then wounded 80-year-old John Franco, who had severe injuries to his hands and wounds to his head and neck. DeMers was pronounced dead en route to the hospital. Manfredonia, now 26, who was a University of Connecticut senior in 2020 studying finance and mechanical engineering, later held another local man hostage for 24 hours. He then drove across the state to Derby, fatally shot a school classmate and kidnapped that victim’s girlfriend. He was caught in Hagerstown, Maryland, ending a six-day manhunt in several states. CONNECTICUT MAN GIVEN 55-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE FOR MURDERING FRIEND, KIDNAPPING WOMAN Manfredonia appeared in state Superior Court in Rockville on Thursday. He pleaded guilty to murder and other charges in both the Willington and Derby cases and agreed to 55-year sentences. Judge Kathleen McNamara imposed the prison term for the sword attack Thursday, which will run concurrent with the sentence for the fatal shooting and kidnapping. Although Connecticut no longer has capital punishment, both DeMers' widow, Cindy, and Franco told the judge they believed Manfredonia deserved the death penalty. Cindy DeMers described rushing to the scene of carnage outside her home that day. ""It was like being in a war zone,"" she said. ""All I could focus on was reassuring Ted that he was going to be OK and we would put his body back together. We will get through this. We had gotten through so much together up until this point. ""Dying was not an option,"" she continued. ""And even seeing him and his injuries, I couldn't even imagine that was a possibility. He was still alive when he was taken away, but he never came home. ... My husband's life was stolen from him viciously. Life as I knew it stolen from me. My world as I knew it came to an end."" Peter Manfredonia, 26, of Newtown, Connecticut, has been sentenced to a cumulative 110 years in prison for the separate killings of Nicholas Eisele and Ted DeMers, causing serious injury to John Franco and kidnapping Shannon Spies. (Ned Gerard/Hearst Connecticut Media via AP, Pool) Franco, a U.S. Navy veteran who is now 83, attended the hearing and added, ""He should be terminated. I'm a true believer in capital punishment, especially in a situation such as this."" Franco was called a hero for coming to DeMers' aid when he saw the attack. Family and friends described DeMers as a kind and generous man who coached Little League in town and would help anybody who needed it. He tried to help Manfredonia that day because he thought Manfredonia had crashed his motorcycle, witnesses said. It was the second straight day that victims of Manfredonia's violent spree offered emotional testimony in court. Manfredonia apologized at both hearings. He was sentenced on Wednesday for shooting 23-year-old Nicholas Eisele to death in Derby and kidnapping Eisele's girlfriend, whom he released unharmed a few hours later in New Jersey. Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky said Thursday that Manfredonia went to DeMers' neighborhood that day to see his ex-girlfriend, who lived nearby. Gedansky said it appeared Manfredonia had plans to kill the woman but was interrupted by Demers, who had approached him on the street to see if he needed help. FORMER UCONN STUDENT PLEADS GUILTY TO 2020 SWORD ATTACK Manfredonia's lawyer, Michael Dolan, said Manfredonia's actual plan was to commit suicide in front of his ex-girlfriend. Dolan said Manfredonia has bipolar disease and anxiety, and was having a psychotic episode at the time of the killings. Gedansky said he believed Manfredonia was desperate when he went to Eisele's apartment two days later, knowing Eisele had money. Manfredonia and Eisele grew up together in Newtown, Connecticut. Manfredonia's apology on Thursday was similar to the one he made on Wednesday. He directed separate comments to DeMers' family, Franco and Donald Hipsky, the man whose home Manfredonia broke into after the sword attack and who was held hostage for 24 hours but not physically hurt. ""There are no words that can possibly atone for what I have done. Know that I am sorry nonetheless,"" he said to DeMers' family. ""You have done nothing to deserve the pain that I have caused. My actions were nothing short of reprehensible. I do not expect forgiveness for my actions and I will regret them every day for the rest of my life.""

Alex Murdaugh's life in lockup: Lawyer reveals exclusive details,"Criminal defense attorney Mark Eiglarsh gives his take on Alex Murdaugh's team appealing his murder conviction on 'The Story.' Convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh has become a notable jailhouse figure who plays checkers and cards with other inmates — but steers clear of the convicted sex offenders in his unit, according to his attorney. ""When he came in, he obviously had a lot of notoriety and was a celebrity of sorts, but he gets along with everybody in the pod,"" Jim Griffin told Fox News Digital of Murdaugh's new home at McCormick Correctional Institution in South Carolina. Murdaugh, 54, is behind bars in the protective custody wing of the maximum security prison, which houses about 28 inmates who are considered potential targets — including child abusers and former law enforcement officers. ""He has a small group he interacts with regularly,"" Griffin said. Murdaugh, he added, avoids the ""significant number"" of inmates in the small unit who were ""convicted of some pretty horrendous sex crimes."" ALEX MURDAUGH'S SECRET PRISON LOCATION REVEALED Alex Murdaugh has been transferred to the McCormick Correctional Institution in South Carolina. (South Carolina Department of Corrections/Google Maps) Murdaugh was sentenced to two life terms last month for fatally shooting his wife, Maggie, 52, and his son, Paul, 22, in June 2021 in an attempt to cover up his alleged financial malfeasance. He arrived at McCormick from Kirkland Correctional Institution on March 31.

Corrections officials told Griffin that some inmates had posted menacing TikTok videos using contraband cellphones threatening physical harm to Murdaugh if they see him in the yard. The attorney added that he was not sure what Murdaugh and the other inmates watch on TV at McCormick, but at Kirkland, there was a clear favorite. ""I've learned that a lot of inmates watch CourtTV. It's their channel,"" he said. In fact, at Kirkland, Murdaugh was ""surprised by the extensive coverage of his case"" on the show after his trial had ended.

An Oklahoma cold case has received renewed attention after an Ohio woman turned to TikTok in search of answers about her missing parents. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) on April 12 identified the remains of Brian Burr, 23, and Rachel Burr, 21.

Austin police chief knocks down 'rampant rumor' of serial killer in Texas capital,"The City Council approved the resolution after hearing testimony of family of loved ones who had disappeared or were found dead in Lady Bird Lake. A series of men found dead in downtown Austin who were roughly the same age and found in the same body of water are likely not the victims of a serial killer, according to the Texas capital's chief of police. Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said detectives suspected accidents or suicides in the recent string of deaths — but he left open the door should additional information become known to investigators. His statement comes as speculation that deaths in the city's Lady Bird Lake — four since February and double that over the past year — could have a connection. Of those, three were discovered near the edge of Rainey Street, a popular downtown strip, and a fourth was located about two miles downriver near a dam. BODIES STACK UP IN TEXAS CITY AMID FEARS OF SERIAL KILLER, RUMORS OF ‘ROOFIE’ ATTACKS Wooden fencing lines the edge of the trail between Rainey Street in downtown Austin and the Lady Bird Lake waterfront, where men have been discovered dead this year. (Matteo Cina/Fox News Digital) ""I realize that there is a rampant rumor about a potential serial killer here in Austin,"" Chacon told FOX 7 Austin. ""We've found no evidence of that."" ""Nothing has come to light that would indicate that there is a serial killer in Austin,"" the chief said. Police had a visible presence on Rainey Street over the weekend, out in force along the strip. City officials have also begun discussing ways to make the waterfront safer, including adding lights to the trails there and increasing Park Ranger patrols. They have also installed high temporary fencing. This undated photo is of Jason John, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Feb. 13, 2023. TEXAS SERIAL KILLER FEARS RISE AS LAKE DEATHS CLIMB TO 4 Austin police for weeks have said publicly that they have not uncovered evidence of foul play in any of the deaths, as their investigations continue. But many Austin residents, as well as independent investigators and web sleuths alike, have argued that the number of bodies found so close to one another is more than a coincidence, especially due to the distance between the strip of bars on Rainey Street and the waterfront itself. This undated photo is of Jonathan Honey, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Saturday, April 1, 2023. The edge of Lady Bird Lake is about a block and a half from the strip and requires climbing over a fence and down a trail. BANK ACCOUNTS OF NEW YORK ‘ROOFIE MURDER’ VICTIMS DRAINED VIA FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY Austin police identified the latest victim last week as John Christopher Hays-Clark, 30. He was pronounced dead at the scene near a dam about two miles down river from where the others were found, closer to Rainey Street. This undated photo is of Clifton Axtell, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on in 2023. Police found Jason John, 30, dead in Lady Bird Lake in February, a week after he was last been seen on Rainey Street, which has a popular row of bars near the water. Clifton Axtell, 40, was identified as the man found dead on March 5. Jonathan Honey, 33, was found on April 1, a day after he was last seen at a food truck on Rainey Street.

Idaho student murders: Bryan Kohberger defense claims surviving roommate has 'exculpatory' evidence,"Correspondent Dan Springer reports the latest from Seattle, Washington. A defense investigator working on behalf of University of Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger asserted in a newly unveiled court filing that a surviving housemate has ""exculpatory"" information that is ""material and necessary"" to the alleged killer's defense. Kohberger, a former criminology Ph.D. candidate, is accused of entering an off-campus home on Nov. 13 around 4 a.m., after the occupants, all undergrad students at the school, had been out on a Friday night into early Saturday morning. Police allege he fatally stabbed four of the six people inside, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, along with Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20. The three women lived there with the two survivors, while Chapin, Kernodle's boyfriend, was spending the night. Of the two survivors, one allegedly heard a commotion and witnessed a masked man exit through a rear sliding door, according to a police affidavit. IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS DISCLOSURE UNLIKELY TIED TO STUDENT STABBINGS: EXPERTS Madison Mogen, top left, smiles on the shoulders of her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves, as they pose with Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and two other housemates in Goncalves' final Instagram post, shared the day before the four students were stabbed to death. The blurred faces are those of the victims' two surviving housemates. (@kayleegoncalves/Instagram) The second, a Nevada native named in the Nevada court filing made public Monday, allegedly heard or saw things that could clear the suspect, according to Richard Bitonti, a defense investigator working for Anne Taylor, Kohberger's court-appointed attorney. In the documents, obtained by Fox News Digital, the subpoena demands the roommate's appearance on June 28, two days into Kohberger's planned preliminary hearing, and warns of a potential fine of $500 or 25 days in jail if she refuses to appear. ""During the course of my investigation, it became known to me that [she] has information material to the charges against Mr. Kohberger,"" Bitonti wrote in an affidavit in support of the subpoena, revealed Monday after online sleuths found the case listed on a Washoe County, Nevada, court docket. A portion of that information, Bitonti added, ""is exculpatory to the defendant."" IDAHO MURDERS: BRYAN KOHBERGER LEAKS ‘HUGE ISSUE’ WITH ‘POTENTIAL TO COMPROMISE’ PROSECUTION, LAWYER WARNS Bryan Kohberger enters a courtroom in Moscow, Idaho on Jan. 12, 2023, for a status hearing. The accused murderer waived his right to a quick preliminary hearing and will appear in court again on June 26. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) The ""information is unique to her experiences and cannot be provided by another witness,"" according to the documents. As a result, Kohberger's defense is asking the court to compel her testimony at his scheduled preliminary hearing in June, as they hope to challenge the probable cause used to justify his arrest. As Fox News Digital has reported, prosecutors can sidestep his attempts to disprove probable cause by seeking a grand jury indictment behind closed doors. ""If there is no preliminary hearing, because there was a superseding indictment, the issue of the subpoena (at least for that hearing) becomes moot,"" Edwina Elcox, a Boise-based criminal defense attorney who previously represented Lori Vallow, told Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, Pool) Even if a grand jury is empaneled behind closed doors, without involvement from Kohberger's defense team, prosecutors would be ethically bound to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence, she said. However, a grand jury would enable prosecutors to present the case without subjecting any witnesses to harrowing cross-examination from Kohberger's defense before trial. ""The prosecutor has to present such exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, even though the defense is not present,"" she said. IDAHO MURDERS: PROSECUTOR SAYS VICTIM'S FAMILY ‘POTENTIAL WITNESSES’ AS DEFENSE OPPOSES GAG ORDER APPEAL The law firm representing the surviving roommate declined to comment, citing Idaho Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall's gag order on the case. Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall speaks during a status hearing for accused murderer Bryan Kohberger on Jan. 12, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) However, in a court filing opposing the subpoena, also published Monday, Reno-based attorney Kelli Anne Viloria argued that the Idaho subpoena was improperly filed and ""there is no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to Idaho for preliminary hearing."" ""There is also no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a hearing and there is no authority to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a Nevada judge making a finding of materiality, necessity and the lack of undue hardship,"" she added. IDAHO'S MOVE TO RESURRECT FIRING SQUAD ‘MAKES SENSE’ AS ‘QUICKEST, SUREST’ DEATH PENALTY OPTION, EXPERT SAYS State police investigators look for clues in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 21, 2022. Four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in the home a week earlier. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) At the time of the stabbings, Kohberger was a Ph.D. criminology student at Washington State University, a neighboring school less than 10 miles away from the Idaho campus. He finished out the semester and drove home, cross-country, with his dad riding shotgun. After his initial arrest, Kohberger's previous public defender in his home state of Pennsylvania said his client was looking forward to being exonerated. Taylor, his attorney in Idaho, ignored requests for comment from Fox News Digital prior to the gag order and has since remained silent. In court filings, her office has slammed what it calls ""grotesquely twisted"" media coverage of the home invasion stabbing that left four college students dead of multiple stab wounds each – some of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the start of the ambush. Defense attorney Anne Taylor joins investigators at a visit to the King Road crime scene on Jan. 3, 2023. Taylor is defending Bryan Kohberger, who is charged with four counts of first-degree murder. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) Experts have told Fox News Digital that they expect Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson to be extra careful as he seeks a conviction in the potential death penalty case in order to avoid possible grounds for appeal. Last month, he informed Judge Marshall and Kohberger's team that his office would be disclosing this week ""potential Brady/Giglio material"" related to a police officer involved in the massacre probe – but that doesn't mean there is a connection with the stabbings of four University of Idaho students in November. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Brady material is information that could potentially prove a defendant's innocence, experts tell Fox News Digital. Giglio material is damaging to the integrity of a witness – in this case, one of the officers involved in the investigation. In previously released court documents, investigators alleged they had linked the suspect to the crime scene through surveillance images of his car and phone records. They also found a knife sheath next to Mogen's body that allegedly contained DNA. Kohberger faces four counts of first-degree murder and another of felony burglary. His preliminary hearing is scheduled to begin on June 26 and could take several days. Fox News' Haley Chi-Sing contributed to this report. Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

GOP says ‘no surprise’ Dems mingled with Chinese operative suspected of running CCP prison in New York City,"Newly released images show the suspect who allegedly ran a secret Chinese police station in New York City at a fundraising event with Sen. Chuck Schumer and Mayor Eric Adams. Congressional Republicans are slamming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and other Democrats for risking national security after the two attended an event last month with a man now facing federal charges for allegedly running a secret Chinese police station in Manhattan. Video recorded on March 18 appears to show Lu Jianwang standing alongside Adams at a fundraising event for the Fukien American Association, a cultural nonprofit linked to the Chinese province. Schumer spoke at the event. Lu was arrested last week and charged with conspiring to act as an agent of China's government, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. ""Chuck Schumer, Eric Adams and New York Democrats have failed to take the threat of Communist China seriously and risked compromising national security for a photo op with Chinese foreign agents infiltrating New York State,"" House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik told Fox News Digital. ""While far-left Democrats in New York are schmoozing our foreign adversaries, House Republicans are working to hold Communist China accountable for their malign actions and defend Americans from the malicious threat of the CCP (Chinese Community Party).""

Records show that since 2006 Lu has contributed at least $32,625 to New York elected officials, including Adams and New York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul. On the other side of Capitol Hill, Republican senators say it is ""no surprise"" that Chinese operatives mingle with Democrats, casting the party as a whole as ""pro-China."" ""It is not surprising that that CCP spies are mingling with prominent Democrats like Chuck Schumer, and it is clear that the left learned nothing after Eric Swalwell,"" Sen.

According to KVUE, Austin police budgeted just over $7.7 million for 2023 and has already spent $13 million during the first six months of the fiscal year. Sergeants working overtime as 911 call takers have caused that amount to go up even more. The City of Austin’s job posting site shows the 911 call takers get a starting pay of $23.85 per hour if the person hired has no experience.

Austin police chief knocks down 'rampant rumor' of serial killer in Texas capital,"The City Council approved the resolution after hearing testimony of family of loved ones who had disappeared or were found dead in Lady Bird Lake. A series of men found dead in downtown Austin who were roughly the same age and found in the same body of water are likely not the victims of a serial killer, according to the Texas capital's chief of police. Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said detectives suspected accidents or suicides in the recent string of deaths — but he left open the door should additional information become known to investigators. His statement comes as speculation that deaths in the city's Lady Bird Lake — four since February and double that over the past year — could have a connection.

GOP says ‘no surprise’ Dems mingled with Chinese operative suspected of running CCP prison in New York City,"Newly released images show the suspect who allegedly ran a secret Chinese police station in New York City at a fundraising event with Sen. Chuck Schumer and Mayor Eric Adams. Congressional Republicans are slamming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and other Democrats for risking national security after the two attended an event last month with a man now facing federal charges for allegedly running a secret Chinese police station in Manhattan. Video recorded on March 18 appears to show Lu Jianwang standing alongside Adams at a fundraising event for the Fukien American Association, a cultural nonprofit linked to the Chinese province. Schumer spoke at the event. Lu was arrested last week and charged with conspiring to act as an agent of China's government, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. ""Chuck Schumer, Eric Adams and New York Democrats have failed to take the threat of Communist China seriously and risked compromising national security for a photo op with Chinese foreign agents infiltrating New York State,"" House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik told Fox News Digital. ""While far-left Democrats in New York are schmoozing our foreign adversaries, House Republicans are working to hold Communist China accountable for their malign actions and defend Americans from the malicious threat of the CCP (Chinese Community Party)."" VIDEO SHOWS SUSPECT ACCUSED OF OPERATING SECRET CHINESE POLICE STATIONS MINGLING WITH SCHUMER, ADAMS Lu Jianwang, right, is seen alongside New York City Mayor Eric Adams at the March 2023 event. (Louis Zhao / Youtube) In April 2022, Lu also met New York Democrat Rep. Grace Meng at a fundraising event, according to the Daily Caller, citing images the outlet found. Records show that since 2006 Lu has contributed at least $32,625 to New York elected officials, including Adams and New York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul. On the other side of Capitol Hill, Republican senators say it is ""no surprise"" that Chinese operatives mingle with Democrats, casting the party as a whole as ""pro-China."" ""It is not surprising that that CCP spies are mingling with prominent Democrats like Chuck Schumer, and it is clear that the left learned nothing after Eric Swalwell,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital. SCHUMER DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT ATTENDING EVENT WITH MAN ACCUSED OF RUNNING SECRET NYC CHINESE POLICE STATION Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. (AP Photo / J. Scott Applewhite / File) Blackburn was referring to an incident in 2020 in which a suspected Chinese spy, known as Fang Fang or Christine Fang, targeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., by reportedly taking part in fundraising for his 2014 reelection campaign, although she did not make donations nor was there evidence of illegal contributions. Fang’s relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors turned sexual, according to reports, and at least two incidents were caught by FBI surveillance. ""While the Biden administration is attempting to appease Beijing and work on climate change, CCP spies are infiltrating cities and organizations around the country,"" Blackburn said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said that it is ""no surprise that Chinese operatives found their way into Democrat events."" ""The Democrat Party is structurally pro-China,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital. ""Democrats get their money from Big Business, Big Hollywood, Big Universities and Big Tech, all of whom get their money from China."" 2 NEW YORK RESIDENTS ALLEGEDLY RAN SECRET CHINESE POLICE STATION New York City Mayor Eric Adams (Lev Radin / Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images / File) ""Democrats are happy to ignore China's genocide of the Uyghurs, other human rights atrocities, culpability for COVID and intellectual property theft,"" Cruz added. Schumer declined to respond to Fox News’ request for comment on the event or the photos taken of him next to a suspected CCP agent. Adams’ office told Fox News that the mayor’s attendance at an event is either to show support for a local community or the city and does not signal any kind of endorsement. A spokesperson for Adams also said he does not know Lu. When announcing Lu’s arrest last week, U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said China's Ministry of Public Security ""has repeatedly and flagrantly violated our nation's sovereignty, including by opening and operating a police station in the middle of New York City.""

Austin police sergeants moonlighting as 911 call takers in wake of hiring crisis: reports,"Cyril Bertheau shares his adventure riding a horse over 2,300 miles from Austin to Seattle after quitting his tech job to follow in a ‘family tradition.’ An Austin, Texas, police staffing crisis has reached a point that sergeants are now filling in as 911 call takers, ensuring emergencies can be tended to in a timely manner, according to reports. ABC station KVUE in Austin reported that sergeants with the Austin Police Department are volunteering to take 911 calls, on top of their full-time jobs as leaders within the department, accumulating overtime hours.

AUSTIN COUNCIL MEMBER RAISES THE ALARM ON DISTRESSED 911 CALL CENTER, LONG HOLD TIMES The sergeant works as an evening patrol shift supervisor, though over the last six months he has been taking 911 calls during overtime hours. Currently, the department has fewer sworn officers than it did 15 years ago, despite a boom in population in the Texas state capital over the past two decades. Struggles to hire new talent and hold onto existing officers stretch back to August 2020, when Austin’s City Council voted to cut the police budget by almost a third to ""re-imagine"" public safety.

TEXAS DPS TROOPERS TO PATROL IN AUSTIN AMID CITY'S POLICE STAFFING CRISIS The employment issues have only compounded, forcing the department to make desperate moves to fill critical voids. ""You’re in a crisis or having a problem. You pick up the phone, you call 911,"" Knouse told KVUE. ""Well, if there’s a bunch of calls holding because there’s no call takers, then obviously that’s a problem."" He added that filling in as a 911 caller has given him a different point of view. ""It’s also been good for me to see kind of what they do and the challenges or just what a unique and challenging skill set it is to answer the phone, to listen to some of these problems,"" he told KVUE. DEFUNDED AUSTIN PD TAKES SO LONG TO RESPOND TO DUI CRASH, DRIVER SOBERS UP AND WALKS FREE: FAMILY Officials with the Austin Police Department did not immediately respond to questions regarding the 911 call taker shortages and the decision to allow sergeants to fill the vacancies with overtime pay. According to KVUE, Austin police budgeted just over $7.7 million for 2023 and has already spent $13 million during the first six months of the fiscal year. Sergeants working overtime as 911 call takers have caused that amount to go up even more. The City of Austin’s job posting site shows the 911 call takers get a starting pay of $23.85 per hour if the person hired has no experience. To qualify for the position, applicants must pass a state exam to get the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Telecommunicator Licensee within a year of employment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Allowing sergeants to fill in as 911 call takers is just another creative solution to filling a void caused by a measure to defund the department.

Austin police chief knocks down 'rampant rumor' of serial killer in Texas capital,"The City Council approved the resolution after hearing testimony of family of loved ones who had disappeared or were found dead in Lady Bird Lake. A series of men found dead in downtown Austin who were roughly the same age and found in the same body of water are likely not the victims of a serial killer, according to the Texas capital's chief of police. Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said detectives suspected accidents or suicides in the recent string of deaths — but he left open the door should additional information become known to investigators. His statement comes as speculation that deaths in the city's Lady Bird Lake — four since February and double that over the past year — could have a connection. Of those, three were discovered near the edge of Rainey Street, a popular downtown strip, and a fourth was located about two miles downriver near a dam.

""Nothing has come to light that would indicate that there is a serial killer in Austin,"" the chief said. Police had a visible presence on Rainey Street over the weekend, out in force along the strip. City officials have also begun discussing ways to make the waterfront safer, including adding lights to the trails there and increasing Park Ranger patrols. They have also installed high temporary fencing. This undated photo is of Jason John, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Feb. 13, 2023. TEXAS SERIAL KILLER FEARS RISE AS LAKE DEATHS CLIMB TO 4 Austin police for weeks have said publicly that they have not uncovered evidence of foul play in any of the deaths, as their investigations continue. But many Austin residents, as well as independent investigators and web sleuths alike, have argued that the number of bodies found so close to one another is more than a coincidence, especially due to the distance between the strip of bars on Rainey Street and the waterfront itself. This undated photo is of Jonathan Honey, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Saturday, April 1, 2023.

Georgia Power bills likely to rise by 12% in June,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. State regulatory staff and Georgia Power Co. have agreed on a plan that will boost power bills by 12% in June to cover the higher costs of natural gas and coal that the utility burns to generate electricity for its 2.7 million customers. The unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. filed new figures Monday saying it needs to collect an additional $6.6 billion from customers over the next three years, under an agreement it reached with Georgia Public Service Commission staff earlier this month. Because of declining natural gas price forecasts, that's actually $1.1 billion less than Georgia Power had earlier projected. But it will boost a typical residential bill to $147.50 a month, up $15.90 from the current $131.60. The increase had originally been predicted to be as high as $23. The five-member elected commission is scheduled to vote on fuel charges on May 16. Any final plan is likely to closely track the agreement between the company and the staff. Bill increases are stacking up for Georgia Power customers. Rates went up 2.5% last month in January after commissioners approved a three-year rate plan in December. Increases of 4.5% will follow in 2024 and 2025. Customers will also have to pay the costs of the third and fourth nuclear units at Plant Vogtle near Augusta. Unit 3 is projected to begin operation in May or June, leading to a roughly $4 a month increase for residential customers. A larger rate increase is likely to follow when Unit 4 begins operations, now projected before March 2024. GEORGIA BOY, 13, CHARGED IN EASTER SUNDAY MURDER OF MAN SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES Typically, a utility is allowed to charge customers for the cost of fuel, but isn’t allowed to make a profit on those charges, unlike the profits Georgia Power is guaranteed for investing in power plants and transmission lines. The all-Republican commission typically decides how much Georgia Power can collect for fuel once every two years. In the meantime, if prices change, the company may collect too much or too little. During this two-year period, even though commissioners approved a 15% boost in fuel costs that began in January 2022, the company collected far too little money. Natural gas prices skyrocketed because of an improving economy and the Ukraine war, and coal prices rose even more steeply in part because of supply and labor shortages. Georgia Power Co. and state regulatory staff agreed on a plan that will likely rise power bills by 12% in June. Georgia Power says it will end the period roughly $4.5 billion in the hole for fuel already burned. Most of the proposed rate increase will make up for that deficit, repaying the company over three years instead of the normal two because the debt is so large. The utility says it forecasts it also needs another $2.2 billion to make up for higher fuel prices going forward. Georgia Power and commission staff have agreed to let the company make larger changes to cover cost swings between fuel-cost rate cases. The agreement would let Georgia Power raise or lower fuel charges by as much as 40% in the interim, instead of the current 15%. Because of unrecovered debt, that ability would likely only be used to further raise customer bills in the next two years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The company and staff also agreed to raise a fuel cost discount for low-income senior citizens from $6 a month now to $8 a month. The Georgia Association of Manufacturers argues commissioners should stretch repayment of the deficit out over five years to reduce rate increases. Georgia Power said Monday it opposes a longer payback period. Environmentalists argue that commissioners should force Georgia Power to bear some rising fuel costs because it has shifted its generation portfolio to depend on natural gas, whose price is volatile. The company argues the commission has already approved the current generation mix as the most economical and reliable option. ",674,WORLD NEWS,us

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to McCarthy’s debt ceiling plan,"Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Republicans' proposal and why Biden's action is 'risky' as the battle over government spending continues. This week marks the biggest test yet for the speakership of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. McCarthy needs to show that he can keep his members together to approve the Republican version of a debt ceiling plan. This is not a zero-sum game for the Speaker. Passage of the bill would mark a significant win for the California Republican. McCarthy would show he could keep his narrow majority and pass a big piece of legislation. But the political chits McCarthy banks with a prospective win are not equivalent to the points he could lose if Republicans struggle to pass the bill. A stumble would represent a major loss for McCarthy. Moreover, failure by Republicans to move their own plan could rattle the markets and send an ominous signal about what to expect later this summer as the sides fight over the debt ceiling. President Biden remains on the sidelines for now. Even some Democrats question the wisdom of that – especially considering how close the nation is creeping to a still unknown debt ceiling deadline. It is generally believed the date will hit sooner rather than later – meaning early to mid-June. That’s because the early read is that receipts for this tax season are down as well as revenue from capital gains. There is also increasing jitteriness about ""credit default swaps."" That’s where the cost of insuring against potential losses in U.S. Treasuries is beginning to be a factor. HOUSE REPUBLICANS TAKE ON EMPIRE STATE OF MIND AMID DEBT CEILING STANDOFF, TRUMP INDICTMENT Fox is told that Mr. Biden will stay away from the bargaining table until House Republicans show this week whether they can approve their own debt ceiling bill. U.S. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), joined by fellow Republican lawmakers, holds a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on March 24, 2023, in Washington, DC. McCarthy spoke after the House passed the Parents Bill of Rights Act, 213-208, sending the bill to the Senate. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) It’s all about that math. McCarthy can lose no more than five votes on his side of the aisle to pass the bill without help from Democrats. If not, McCarthy must develop another plan – or punt. ""We will keep trying until we figure something out,"" said one senior House Republican leadership source when asked about ‘Plan B.’ Interestingly, most conservatives appear more willing to support McCarthy’s package right now. Some moderates are skeptical about people falling through the cracks. There’s worry about cuts to emergency food assistance and Medicaid. The current proposal requires able-bodied adults with no dependents to work 20 hours a week to qualify for benefits. Some conservatives want to bolster that to 30 hours. The definition of work requirements are fairly liberal. ""Working"" could actually mean someone being on the job. But it also means seeking work, receiving formal training for work or even volunteering. Some midwestern members fret about reductions in ethanol tax credits and assistance which is part of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) approved last summer.

So, plucking off various parts of the IRA in McCarthy’s bill is the next best thing. The ethanol issue could cause heartburn for some midwestern Republicans. But so far, passage appears within reach. ""The Speaker has done a good job of finding the sweet spot here,"" said one Republican House member who asked not to be identified. ""This package is so conservative, you can’t vote against it,"" observed another Republican, noting that various right-wing interest groups will ‘score’ or issue or mark this as a ‘key vote’ documenting which Members supported the plan and who didn’t. Keep in mind that this measure will not be the final bill. The Senate won’t consider this particular package. One knowledgeable source said that McCarthy had to cobble together a measure just ""to get the monkey off our back"" that Republicans weren’t engaged. However, passing the bill presents the Senate a debt ceiling ""legislative vehicle"" with which to work over the next few weeks. The Senate could potentially take the bill and strip out the House language. Senators could then drop in their own provisions which can overcome a filibuster and send it back to the House when the nation approaches the deadline. In essence, having a legislative vehicle available on the debt ceiling helps both sides in the long run – even if they disagree with the policy. It just makes things easier parliamentarily. But here’s the real problem. The ultimate bill which raises the debt ceiling must garner 60 yeas to break a filibuster in the Senate. We’re weeks away from that. And no one knows what that bill looks like. Members from the conservative House Freedom Caucus will likely balk because a final piece of legislation on the debt ceiling won’t mirror what they agreed to in McCarthy’s bill. That’s where things could get dicey for McCarthy. ""Either he takes the Senate bill and faces a (no confidence vote) or we default,"" said one House Republican. ""That’s quite a choice."" That’s why there are increasing worries about a market shock or one of the ratings agencies knocking down the credit worthiness of the U.S. ""Every day that goes by that we do not get this resolved is not a good day,"" said Fox Business Contributor Gary Kaltbaum. ""And you never know what's going to be the tipping point. But there eventually will be a tipping point."" A senior GOP source familiar with the timing of the bill says the Republican brass plans to put the McCarthy measure on the floor Wednesday. House Republican leaders aim for Wednesday so they have Thursday and Friday as backstops if the votes aren’t there and the legislation requires more massaging. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., arrives at the Capitol as the House meets for a second day to elect a speaker and convene the 118th Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ""We’ll pass this by the skin of our teeth,"" said one veteran Republican. ""We never do it the easy way. We’re Republicans."" The bigger issue will be when the House is forced to vote on the ""real"" bill in a few weeks. Fox is told that Freedom Caucus members succeeded in securing many of their demands. It’s unclear if they could swallow changes down the road. It’s possible that anything short of the McCarthy bill gives those conservative members enough of a reason to vote no BATHROOM POLITICS: REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY'VE FOUND WEDGE ISSUE WITH TRANSGENDER ATHLETESAlso on the table is a possible move by House Democrats and some Republicans to go over the head of the Speaker and deposit a separate debt ceiling bill on the floor. This is called a ""discharge petition."" It’s a rarely-successful gambit to force the House to go against the wishes of the leadership and vote on a bill engineered by the rank and file. It takes 218 members of the House to successfully advance a discharge petition. That means if all Democrats stick together to avoid an economic calamity, they’d only need to nab five Republicans to support the maneuver. However, only two discharge petitions have been successful in the House in more than two decades. That’s why everyone is starting to monitor Wall Street. ""Markets will rule. Politicians will follow the market,"" observed Kaltbalm. In other words, a market crash could compel everyone in Washington to find religion on the debt ceiling. Fast. Kaltbaum says he could envision a scenario where the market drops three percent one day. Then two percent the next day. Then four percent the day after that ""until they finally get their act together"" in Washington. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So here’s what to watch for in the coming days: McCarthy likely notches a win by the end of the week. But that ""win"" could spell trouble for McCarthy himself when it comes to the ""actual"" debt ceiling bill this summer. And that’s where the true standoff over the debt ceiling may unfold.

"Senate Dems say Biden should talk to McCarthy, but without linking debt ceiling, spending cuts","Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Republicans' proposal and why Biden's action is 'risky' as the battle over government spending continues. Democrats over the weekend said President Biden should accept House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's invitation to talk about the fiscal outlook for the federal government, but like Biden argued those talks should not combine the two issues of how to raise the government's borrowing limit and the GOP's demand for spending cuts. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., emerged over the weekend calling for Biden to speak with the Republican leader after he put out a 320-page bill that would raise the debt ceiling while capping spending and imposing work requirements for government benefits, among other measures. Neither signaled support for the spending cuts that Republicans are seeking, and made it clear any further talks should keep separate the two issues. ""Of course, President Biden should sit down with Speaker McCarthy,"" Klobuchar said Sunday on CNN Sunday. But she also indicated she favors Biden's position, which is to handle the debt ceiling first, and only then talk about possible spending cuts.

We just passed a budget with 18 Republicans voting for it in the U.S. Senate,"" she said, referring to the $1.7 trillion spending bill passed in December. She made it clear the debt ceiling should be everyone's top priority. ""Right now, we have got to simply make clear we're going to avoid default and get this behind us. We pay our bills,"" Klobuchar said. Durbin took the same approach by saying more meetings are fine as long as the issues are treated separately. ""Of course we should talk"" to Republicans, Durbin said on NBC Sunday. ""Listen, we don't need to default in this country. If we default on our national debt, it's going to cost our economy dearly.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., released a statement late last week calling Biden’s failure to hold a second meeting with McCarthy a ""deficiency of leadership"" and even agreeing that federal spending should be reined in.

GOP says ‘no surprise’ Dems mingled with Chinese operative suspected of running CCP prison in New York City,"Newly released images show the suspect who allegedly ran a secret Chinese police station in New York City at a fundraising event with Sen. Chuck Schumer and Mayor Eric Adams. Congressional Republicans are slamming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and other Democrats for risking national security after the two attended an event last month with a man now facing federal charges for allegedly running a secret Chinese police station in Manhattan. Video recorded on March 18 appears to show Lu Jianwang standing alongside Adams at a fundraising event for the Fukien American Association, a cultural nonprofit linked to the Chinese province. Schumer spoke at the event. Lu was arrested last week and charged with conspiring to act as an agent of China's government, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. ""Chuck Schumer, Eric Adams and New York Democrats have failed to take the threat of Communist China seriously and risked compromising national security for a photo op with Chinese foreign agents infiltrating New York State,"" House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik told Fox News Digital.

"Kelly vetoes $1.4B tax cut, individual flat tax proposal","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday vetoed a bill that would have cut taxes in Kansas by nearly $1.4 billion over the next three years, objecting to a proposal included by conservative Republicans to impose a single-rate flat income tax for individuals. Kelly said abandoning the state's current three-rate individual income tax with higher rates for higher earners would have been fiscally reckless and threatened funding for public schools. She announced her veto at a Topeka-area elementary school and recalled the state's nationally notorious 2012-2013 experiment in slashing income taxes and the huge budget shortfalls that followed under then-Republican Gov. Sam Brownback. Republican leaders plan to attempt overriding Kelly's veto once the full GOP-controlled Legislature reconvenes Wednesday to wrap up its business for the year. Backers of the bill included Americans for Prosperity, the grassroots low-tax, small-government group funded by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers. Supporters appeared to have a good chance of getting the two-thirds majorities necessary to override a veto. KANSAS GOV. KELLY VETOES TRANS BATHROOM, YOUTH SEX CHANGE BANS ""It is a throwback to the Brownback tax experiment, and we all know how that turned out,"" Kelly told reporters, hitting a key theme of her successful 2018 and 2022 campaigns for governor. ""Any tax cut we pass needs to be sustainable, fiscally responsible and targeted to the people who need it the most."" The measure also would have reduced taxes on retirees' Social Security incomes and accelerate phasing out of the state's sales tax on groceries, so that it would end at the start of 2024 instead of 2025, both measures Kelly supported. It also would have reduced property taxes for most homeowners by $46 a year, a proposal pushed by Democrats. Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday vetoed a proposal to slash state taxes by nearly $1.4 billion and implement a flat rate for individuals. (AP Photo/John Hanna) The income tax changes were a nonstarter for many Democrats, particularly because it set the rate at 5.15% when the state's current top rate is 5.7%. As an alternative, Kelly proposed a one-time, $450 rebate for each Kansas individual filer, so that the state's revenues would not be reduced each year going forward. Republicans have been cold to the idea of a rebate in the past. Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican, called the rebate proposal ""gimmicky"" and tells people that the governor sees tax dollars as ""her money,"" rather than ""recognizing the money we collect belongs to the people."" KANSAS SETS MARCH 2024 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DATE Kansas' tax collections generally have run ahead of expectations since lawmakers repealed most of the tax experiment under Brownback in 2017. And the veto came four days after state officials and university economists issued a new fiscal forecast that boosted the state's official projections for tax collections through June 2024 by roughly 1%. Even with the tax cuts Kelly vetoed factored in, the state is on track to end June 2024 with surplus cash and rainy day funds of more than $4 billion. Kelly and lawmakers in both parties see the tax cuts as a way of helping people deal with inflation.

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to McCarthy’s debt ceiling plan,"Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Republicans' proposal and why Biden's action is 'risky' as the battle over government spending continues. This week marks the biggest test yet for the speakership of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. McCarthy needs to show that he can keep his members together to approve the Republican version of a debt ceiling plan. This is not a zero-sum game for the Speaker. Passage of the bill would mark a significant win for the California Republican. McCarthy would show he could keep his narrow majority and pass a big piece of legislation. But the political chits McCarthy banks with a prospective win are not equivalent to the points he could lose if Republicans struggle to pass the bill. A stumble would represent a major loss for McCarthy. Moreover, failure by Republicans to move their own plan could rattle the markets and send an ominous signal about what to expect later this summer as the sides fight over the debt ceiling. President Biden remains on the sidelines for now. Even some Democrats question the wisdom of that – especially considering how close the nation is creeping to a still unknown debt ceiling deadline. It is generally believed the date will hit sooner rather than later – meaning early to mid-June. That’s because the early read is that receipts for this tax season are down as well as revenue from capital gains. There is also increasing jitteriness about ""credit default swaps."" That’s where the cost of insuring against potential losses in U.S. Treasuries is beginning to be a factor. HOUSE REPUBLICANS TAKE ON EMPIRE STATE OF MIND AMID DEBT CEILING STANDOFF, TRUMP INDICTMENT Fox is told that Mr. Biden will stay away from the bargaining table until House Republicans show this week whether they can approve their own debt ceiling bill.

McCarthy spoke after the House passed the Parents Bill of Rights Act, 213-208, sending the bill to the Senate. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) It’s all about that math. McCarthy can lose no more than five votes on his side of the aisle to pass the bill without help from Democrats. If not, McCarthy must develop another plan – or punt. ""We will keep trying until we figure something out,"" said one senior House Republican leadership source when asked about ‘Plan B.’ Interestingly, most conservatives appear more willing to support McCarthy’s package right now. Some moderates are skeptical about people falling through the cracks. There’s worry about cuts to emergency food assistance and Medicaid. The current proposal requires able-bodied adults with no dependents to work 20 hours a week to qualify for benefits. Some conservatives want to bolster that to 30 hours. The definition of work requirements are fairly liberal. ""Working"" could actually mean someone being on the job. But it also means seeking work, receiving formal training for work or even volunteering. Some midwestern members fret about reductions in ethanol tax credits and assistance which is part of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) approved last summer.

However, passing the bill presents the Senate a debt ceiling ""legislative vehicle"" with which to work over the next few weeks. The Senate could potentially take the bill and strip out the House language. Senators could then drop in their own provisions which can overcome a filibuster and send it back to the House when the nation approaches the deadline. In essence, having a legislative vehicle available on the debt ceiling helps both sides in the long run – even if they disagree with the policy. It just makes things easier parliamentarily. But here’s the real problem. The ultimate bill which raises the debt ceiling must garner 60 yeas to break a filibuster in the Senate. We’re weeks away from that. And no one knows what that bill looks like. Members from the conservative House Freedom Caucus will likely balk because a final piece of legislation on the debt ceiling won’t mirror what they agreed to in McCarthy’s bill. That’s where things could get dicey for McCarthy. ""Either he takes the Senate bill and faces a (no confidence vote) or we default,"" said one House Republican. ""That’s quite a choice."" That’s why there are increasing worries about a market shock or one of the ratings agencies knocking down the credit worthiness of the U.S. ""Every day that goes by that we do not get this resolved is not a good day,"" said Fox Business Contributor Gary Kaltbaum. ""And you never know what's going to be the tipping point. But there eventually will be a tipping point."" A senior GOP source familiar with the timing of the bill says the Republican brass plans to put the McCarthy measure on the floor Wednesday. House Republican leaders aim for Wednesday so they have Thursday and Friday as backstops if the votes aren’t there and the legislation requires more massaging. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., arrives at the Capitol as the House meets for a second day to elect a speaker and convene the 118th Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ""We’ll pass this by the skin of our teeth,"" said one veteran Republican. ""We never do it the easy way. We’re Republicans."" The bigger issue will be when the House is forced to vote on the ""real"" bill in a few weeks. Fox is told that Freedom Caucus members succeeded in securing many of their demands. It’s unclear if they could swallow changes down the road. It’s possible that anything short of the McCarthy bill gives those conservative members enough of a reason to vote no BATHROOM POLITICS: REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY'VE FOUND WEDGE ISSUE WITH TRANSGENDER ATHLETESAlso on the table is a possible move by House Democrats and some Republicans to go over the head of the Speaker and deposit a separate debt ceiling bill on the floor. This is called a ""discharge petition."" It’s a rarely-successful gambit to force the House to go against the wishes of the leadership and vote on a bill engineered by the rank and file. It takes 218 members of the House to successfully advance a discharge petition. That means if all Democrats stick together to avoid an economic calamity, they’d only need to nab five Republicans to support the maneuver. However, only two discharge petitions have been successful in the House in more than two decades. That’s why everyone is starting to monitor Wall Street. ""Markets will rule. Politicians will follow the market,"" observed Kaltbalm. In other words, a market crash could compel everyone in Washington to find religion on the debt ceiling. Fast. Kaltbaum says he could envision a scenario where the market drops three percent one day. Then two percent the next day. Then four percent the day after that ""until they finally get their act together"" in Washington. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So here’s what to watch for in the coming days: McCarthy likely notches a win by the end of the week. But that ""win"" could spell trouble for McCarthy himself when it comes to the ""actual"" debt ceiling bill this summer. And that’s where the true standoff over the debt ceiling may unfold.

Indiana GOP slashes proposed public health funding by $125M,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Republican legislators are poised to direct only about two-thirds of the money that Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb sought toward tackling the state’s poor national rankings in areas such as obesity, smoking and life expectancy and improving local emergency services. Budget plans endorsed by House and Senate members would make up to $225 million available for counties taking the optional step of expanding public health programs over the next two years. While that is a major boost from the current $7 million in year in state funding, Holcomb requested nearly $350 million from the new state budget that the Republican-dominated Legislature will vote on later this week. Republican former state Sen. Luke Kenley, who was co-chairman of a Holcomb-appointed commission on public health, said Monday that he still hoped lawmakers would approve about $15 million in additional specific funding aimed toward training and equipment for emergency medical service providers in rural counties. Kenley said he knew it was a ""big ask"" to get such a large increase for public health spending. INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB'S PUBLIC HEALTH EXPANSION PASSES LEGISLATIVE PANEL ""It’s enough to get us going on a pretty big project,"" Kenley said. House and Senate negotiators continued working behind closed doors Monday on a budget deal after an updated tax revenue report released last week showed the state is projected to collect about $1.5 billion, or 2.5%, more than previously expected through July 2025. Those projections, however, were unlikely to mean more money for the public health expansion that has faced hesitancy among the Legislature’s most conservative members and some opposition among voters with grievances over government-ordered COVID-19 precautions who said they feared creeping state authority over local health agencies. Republican Indiana Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ryan Mishler noted last week several issues fellow party members may raise with Republican Gov. Eric Holcombs $350 million public health spending proposal. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings, file) ""That’s more than just the funding,"" Republican Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ryan Mishler of Mishawaka said last week. ""I think you have a lot of members that just have some issues with the (expansion) itself. So that’ll be a tougher one, probably, to increase the funding."" Republican House Speaker Todd Huston called the $225 million included in the budget proposals ""an historic investment"" and said it would likely remain near that level in the final budget deal. Holcomb’s original budget request would have directed $300 million over the next two years toward boosting Indiana’s county public health department funding from its current 45th national ranking. Those county health departments are now primarily funded by local taxes. SEN. MIKE BRAUN REVEALS 2024 PICK FOR GOP NOMINATION: 'IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT' The governor’s public health commission had sought a $240 million annual boost to lift funding for county public health departments to the national average, but Holcomb said time was needed to ""build the structure"" for expanded health programs. Holcomb made the public health expansion one of his top priorities for the new state budget, saying during his State of the State speech in January that Indiana’s poor health rankings were ""a pattern we need to reverse."" The governor’s office declined to specifically comment on the negotiations over the public health spending increase. House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta of Fort Wayne said the Legislature should seize the chance to expand those programs as the tax revenue forecast shows that the money is available. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Employers will tell you that it’s very important to have not only well-educated workforce, but a healthy one as well,"" GiaQuinta said.

AOC suggests DeSantis would be the 'weaker' 2024 GOP nominee: 'That base belongs to Donald Trump',"Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., slams Democrats for reintroducing $92.9 trillion Green New Deal bill. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., said she thinks that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is ""weaker"" than former President Donald Trump, as polls show DeSantis faring better than Trump against President Biden in a hypothetical 2024 matchup. MSNBC's Jen Psaki asked the congresswoman if Trump winning the GOP nomination would be the Democrats' best chance at securing the White House next cycle. While AOC has been an outspoken critic of the former president, the progressive suggested DeSantis is ""weaker."" ""I think that Governor DeSantis has made some very large critical errors. And I think he's weaker,"" Cortez said of the Florida Governor, who is expected to launch a run for president in 2024. AOC ADMITS ‘MASSIVE’ SCALE OF GREEN NEW DEAL, SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE EVEN WORSE Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (Tom Williams) ""You can't out Trump, Trump right?""

""He has sacrificed I think the one thing that others may have thought would make him competitive, which is this idea that he would somehow be more rational than Donald Trump, which he isn't,"" the congresswoman told Psaki. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is rumored to be considering a run for president in 2024, but has not entered into the race. (Sean Rayford) AOC also said that there is nobody in the Republican field who she could see successfully taking on Trump for the GOP nomination. ""The Republican Party is so disorganized that I really don't see someone who can unite that party, even beyond Donald Trump,"" she added. Former President Donald Trump announced  in November that he would be making a third bid for the White House.  (Scott Olson) As Trump and DeSantis remain the top two contenders for the 2024 GOP nomination, a recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll found that 64% of those who voted for Trump in 2020 would like to see him as the GOP nominee again in 2024, while 27% would prefer a different candidate.

"Trump let trans beauty queen compete in Miss Universe, in a potential 2024 GOP primary liability","Trump is running for president under the cloud of a 34-count indictment. Before declaring Sunday that ""God created two genders, male and female,"" former President Donald Trump rose to stardom among the LGBTQ community when he overturned the rules at his own Miss Universe organization to allow a transgender woman to compete in 2012. Over a decade ago, Trump famously overturned an earlier decision by the Miss Universe organization, which Trump owned from 1996 to 2015, to disqualify Canadian model Jenna Talackova, then 23, because she was not a ""naturally born"" female. Trump reversed the decision, saying the organization would respect the laws of Canada and allow Talackova to compete for the Miss Universe Canada title, where the winner would go on to compete in the global telecast. ""We let her in,"" Trump said in a video on April 4, 2012. ""We’ll see what happens. Maybe she’ll do well, maybe she won’t. You have 58 different girls trying to be Miss Canada. It’ll be very interesting to see what happens. If for some reason she should win, well, then she has to win the Miss Universe contest. Everybody wants to be Miss Universe.

""As long as she meets the standards of legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, which we understand that she does, Jenna Talackova is free to compete in the 2012 Miss Universe Canada pageant,"" Cohen said at the time. Days later, after holding discussions with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), the Miss Universe organization announced a policy change to allow transgender women to take part in all of its competitions starting in 2013.

UN: Thousands in West Africa face acute food shortage,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Forty-eight million people in West and Central Africa face acute food insecurity in the coming months, a 10-year high spurred by insecurity, climate shocks, COVID-19 and high prices, United Nations humanitarian agencies warned on Tuesday. West and Central Africa has faced increasing risks caused by higher temperatures and erratic rainfall. War in Ukraine has contributed to food and fertilizer shortages in one of the world's poorest regions.

SOMALIA DROUGHT 'EXTREMELY CRITICAL' BUT NO FAMINE PROJECTED That is driven in part by the plight of countries in the semi-arid Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert including Mali and Burkina Faso which are battling an Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands and displaced around 2.5 million. A record 45,000 people in the Sahel are expected to face catastrophic hunger, a level just short of famine, according to the agencies.

Don Lemon firing from CNN linked to explosive on-air exchange with Vivek Ramaswamy; GOP hopeful reacts,"GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and CNN's Don Lemon had a heated argument about the Civil War and the history of Black American gun rights. Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy sounded off on Don Lemon's firing from CNN, which was allegedly linked to a contentious on-air exchange the two of them had last week on ""CNN This Morning."" Lemon fueled a fiery spat with Ramaswamy for comments the 2024 hopeful made about the freedoms of Black Americans in the post-Civil War era, which Lemon claimed ""insulted"" him as a Black American. In its reporting on Lemon's firing, The New York Times suggested the morning show blow-up was linked, saying, ""The incident left several CNN leaders exasperated,"" per sources. CNN FIRES DON LEMON, LEAVING LONGTIME ANCHOR ‘STUNNED’ Ramaswamy said, ""It's clear"" their exchange ""played in role"" in what he called a ""sound decision"" by CNN in an interview with Fox News Digital Monday. ""I think that any network that wants to foster open debate should embrace that principle by not restricting what someone can say or saying what someone can say is restricted based on their skin color. And I think they made the right decision here,"" Ramaswamy said. Don Lemons heated on-air spat with GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy last week was cited as a factor in the CNN host's firing. (Screenshots/CNN) Ramaswamy, who had no prior interaction with Lemon before the ""CNN This Morning"" sit-down, told Fox News Digital that there was an ""irony"" between the fallout from their exchange and the disparaging comments Lemon said about his GOP primary rival Nikki Haley being past her ""prime"" due to her age and gender while Ramaswamy couldn't speak about post-Civil War history because he wasn't Black. He also speculated CNN's firing of its longtime liberal host is a sign that ""we're on the cusp of national cultural revival,"" recalling Netflix's decision to stand behind Dave Chappelle's comedy special following uproar from staffers, telling Fox News Digital he's hoping CNN ""may be going through similar kinds of cultural transformation."" NIKKI HALEY TAUNTS CNN'S DON LEMON OVER FIRING: ‘A GREAT DAY FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE’ It was reported that Don Lemon's hostile exchange with 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy last week was a factor in his abrupt firing from CNN. (Screenshot/CNN) ""I've been working very hard over the last three years, over three years, really trying to transform corporate culture in this country to embrace true diversity of thought. And I think that's going to be better for companies, I think it's going to be better for the country and we're slowly starting to see the fruits of those efforts,"" Ramaswamy said. ""This is also why I, unlike many other people in my position, go out of my way to engage in dialogue with those who disagree with me, including networks outside of conservative media, because I think it's important to air what otherwise are the hypocrisies that don't get aired. And I think good things happen when hypocrisies are aired if you have good leaders who are willing to act based on that,"" he continued. Following what ended up being his final appearance on ""CNN This Morning"" on Monday, Lemon took to Twitter with the shocking revelation that he was fired by the network. Vivek Ramaswamy speaks at CPAC 2022. ( Dylan Hollingsworth/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""I was informed this morning by my agent that I have been terminated by CNN. I am stunned,"" Lemon wrote. ""After 17 years at CNN I would have though that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network. It is clear that there are some larger issues at play."" CNN'S DON LEMON ACCUSED OF EXTENSIVE MISOGYNY, SENDING THREATENING TEXTS TO FEMALE COLLEAGUE: REPORT CNN, which had characterized the firing as a parting of ways in a statement that followed Lemon's tweet, pushed back at the former anchor's characterization of what transpired, saying, ""Don Lemon’s statement about this morning’s events is inaccurate. He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter."" Don Lemon was fired by CNN on Monday, leaving him ""stunned."" (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for THR) The stunning termination came after a streak of controversies and viewership blunders. Lemon, who had previously hosted a poorly-watched two-hour solo show in primetime, was pulled by Licht for a revamped morning show with co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, something Lemon had repeatedly insisted was a ""promotion."" But like his primetime stint, his new program was met with dismal ratings. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It didn't take long for Lemon and his female colleagues to emerge in tabloid news over off-camera feuds, including one incident where Lemon snapped at Collins for interrupting him on air, leaving her visibly upset. Lemon was also the subject of a bombshell exposé in Variety earlier this month that documented years-long allegations of misogyny towards women at the network. Joseph A.

Newly-formed nonprofit seeks to buy most of Maine newspapers,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Members of the group, Maine Journalism Foundation, said Monday they hope to buy Masthead Maine, which owns the Portland Press Herald, the state's largest daily newspaper, and 29 other daily and weekly papers. Masthead Maine's owner told staff in March that he's considering selling the media holdings. The potential buy comes as some newspapers around the country have explored not-for-profit models to try to achieve sustainability.

What Grimes' AI music offer could mean for the future of the industry,"Duke law and philosophy professor and author Nita Farahany says the challenge for humans with quickly developing artificial intelligence is the ethical and legal constraints around it. As controversy swirls around the use of famous artists' vocals for AI-generated music, Grimes seems to be embracing the use of artificial intelligence in the music industry. In a tweet Sunday, the 33-year-old Canadian singer, whose real name is Claire Elise Boucher, said she is happy to have her voice featured on AI-simulated music tracks as long as she is compensated with royalties for successful songs. AI-GENERATED SONG USING DRAKE AND THE WEEKND VOCALS GOES VIRAL, RAISING LEGAL CONCERNS ""I’ll split 50 [percent] royalties on any successful AI generated song that uses my voice,"" Grimes, who shares two children with Elon Musk, tweeted. ""Same deal as I would with any artist i collab with. Feel free to use my voice without penalty. I have no label and no legal bindings."" Grimes made the offer in response to a headline about a fake AI generated Drake and Weeknd song ""Heart on My Sleeve"" that went viral over the weekend and was uploaded to Spotify. The song, which used the stars' vocals and was created by a TikTok user utilizing AI software, prompted significant questions about copyright, compensation and the mounting legal implications of AI's role in music creation. While Drake had no comment on this new single, he previously shared his thoughts about AI on Instagram. ""This is the final straw AI,"" he shared when an AI-generated clip of him singing Ice Spice's ""Munch (Feeling You)"" surfaced.

The company, one of the three largest in the world, reportedly sent a letter to Spotify and Apple Music requesting the streaming services prohibit AI companies from accessing music libraries. Nita Farahany, a leading scholar on the ethical, legal and social implications of emerging technologies, told Fox News on Monday that AI tools in music raise concerns about the role of human creators and the ethical challenges of computer-generated art. CLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' FULL COVERAGE OF AI ""I think one of the real challenges for us in the days ahead is not just whether or not somebody like Grimes is willing to enter into it, but how do we begin to think about things are created by AI?"" Farahany said on ""The Story. ""Can AI be an author? Is AI a co-author? Is AI an artist? Is the art that is created in fact art? Are we going to be able to tell the difference between what is real and what is not real? And how our brains be able to detect those differences. What is the role of creators and humans going forward? I think a lot of these technologies are progressing so rapidly and so much faster than people can even keep up with the ethics and constraints and safeguards around it.'

Blinken's alleged role in 'Russian disinfo' Hunter letter disqualifies him as Ukraine war pointman: critics,"Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe sounds off on 'The Story.' Allegations then-Biden campaign adviser Antony Blinken was the ""impetus"" behind the letter signed by 51 current-or-former intel officials that claimed Hunter Biden's laptop bombshell had the hallmarks of a ""Russian information campaign"" should preclude him from representing the United States in any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, critics said Monday. Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe recounted on ""The Story"" how, after people like Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., declared the laptop story a Kremlin smear campaign, he intently contradicted such claims publicly. ""The only intelligence Adam Schiff had is the intelligence that I've shared with him, and the intelligence community doesn't have any that indicates this is a Russian disinformation campaign,"" Ratcliffe said, adding he declined to say at the time he knew the FBI had the laptop's contents in its possession – because he also did not want to prejudice the future first son's legal rights. At the time the letter was published in Politico, Ratcliffe said former acting CIA Director Mike Morell – whose testimony before House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, reportedly identified Blinken as the impetus behind the letter – knew that the intelligence community, under Ratcliffe, already declared the laptop not to be disinformation.

""They obviously did it as an effort not just to win the election, but to mislead voters about the truth. They suppressed the truth and they and they amplified a lie,"" he said. In a time of less discordant politics, Ratcliffe added, Blinken would face bipartisan calls to resign his current post. Additionally, given the allegations, Blinken should not be trusted as America's top diplomat in any negotiations between Russia and their foes like Ukraine, he said.

Americans spending up to $85k to bulletproof cars as crime surges: 'Uncertainty... has become a major concern',"Founder and CEO of Armormax Mark Burton discusses the demand for bulletproof cars among surging crime in liberal cities. As crime takes hold of U.S. cities, Americans are taking drastic measures to protect themselves and their families by spending tens of thousands of dollars to bulletproof their cars. Founder and CEO of Armormax Mark Burton explained how his clientele has evolved from the world's most wealthy to everyday Americans in recent years during ""Fox & Friends. ""Ten years ago, it was the richest of the rich that were mainly concerned about their business,"" Burton told Todd Piro Monday, ""Today, that's gone down the economic pyramid. You have doctors, you have lawyers, you have real estate agents, you have developers, you have the… average Joe, I can say, that are spending some money to protect themselves in their vehicles."" ONE OUT OF EVERY 179 AMERICANS WILL EVENTUALLY BE MURDERED IF CRIME RATE CONTINUES, STUDY FINDS On the high end, Americans are spending up to $85,000 to have their car completely bulletproofed. The price tag, which Burton explained depends on the model of the vehicle, can also be tailored accordingly if a client wants just portions of the car bulletproofed to include certain windows and/or doors. Some Americans are getting their cars bulletproofed for a 'peace of mind' amid surging crime, founder of Armormax Mark Burton says ""They're looking for peace of mind,"" Burton said. ""It's almost like an insurance policy. They hope they never have to use it. But… if those experiences occur, or those incidences occur, then they're safe."" Burton noted the evolving clientele has happened over the course of the last year and a half, noting surging violence in major cities as a driving force for the shift. MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS ""The change started occurring about 18 months ago,"" Burton said.

Miranda Devine calls for intel officials to lose security clearances over false claims about Hunter laptop,"New York Post columnist Miranda Devine discusses the expected meeting between Hunter Biden's attorneys and Justice Department officials. New York Post columnist Miranda Devine called for security clearances to be stripped from all 51 former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming the stories about Hunter Biden's laptop were Russian disinformation. On ""America's Newsroom"" Monday, Devine accused the intel officials of abusing their authority and said Biden used the letter as a ""get out of jail free card"" in his final presidential debate against Donald Trump. REPUBLICANS RESPOND AFTER IRS WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS HUNTER BIDEN INVESTIGATION IS BEING MISHANDLED MIRANDA DEVINE: It's just bombshell on top of bombshell. And you're right. The revelation that the Biden campaign – specifically now-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when he was a campaign senior adviser – reached out to a high-ranking former acting director of the CIA and got him to organize this letter, claiming falsely that the stories we published from the laptop were Russian disinformation. Those 51 former intelligence officials are really at fault. … And they should have their security clearances stripped. They abused their former higher authority. They did not do any due diligence. They peppered the end of the letter with weasel words so that they could have plausible deniability now, but it doesn't wash. They saw how that letter was handled by the media as they intended, by calling it Russian disinformation, reducing our reporting, and they never spoke up. John Brennan and the rest of them fanned out across the left- wing media and kept on saying drumbeat after drumbeat, ‘This is straight from the Kremlin.’ And of course, a couple of days later, Joe Biden used that letter to get out of jail free effectively at the last debate against Donald Trump. Very effectively. It worked. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Hunter Biden (Getty Images) A former CIA official testified that then-Biden campaign senior adviser, now-Secretary of State Antony Blinken ""played a role in the inception"" of the public statement signed by current and past intelligence officials that claimed the Hunter Biden laptop was part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell testified before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, and revealed that Blinken was ""the impetus"" of the public statement signed in October 2020 that implied the laptop belonging to Hunter Biden was disinformation. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, sent a letter to Blinken Thursday, notifying him that the panels are ""conducting oversight of federal law-enforcement and intelligence matters within our respective jurisdictions."" In October 2020, weeks before the presidential election, dozens of ex-national security officials signed onto a letter claiming that Hunter's laptop had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."" The former officials included former Obama CIA Director John Brennan, former Obama DNI James Clapper, and former CIA director, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, among others.

"Chicago must rehire, pay back wages to workers punished over COVID-19 vaccination mandate: Judge","Restaurant owner Leonardo DeFranco and executive director of the Fulton Market association Roger Romanelli joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the new mandate. An Illinois judge ruled that the city of Chicago must rehire and pay back lost wages of unionized city employees who were fired or disciplined for violating COVID-19 vaccination requirements. Administrative law judge Anna Hamburg-Gal, writing on behalf of the Illinois Labor Relations Board, said that the city ""failed and refused"" to bargain in good faith with union leaders ""over the effects of its decision to implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate."" The decision applies to unionized city of Chicago employees working as carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, machinists, and other job categories. Affected employees must also be paid back lost wages and benefits with 7% annual interest, according to the ruling. Illinois judge ruled Chicago must hire and pay back workers fired over COVID-19 vaccination requirements. (iStock) LORI LIGHTFOOT ACCUSED OF IGNORING ‘SOCIAL CONTRACT’ WITH POLICE BY LOWBALLING COVID DISABILITY BENEFITS In 2021, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced all city employees must be fully vaccinated. She warned there would be ""consequences"" for any city employee who wasn't fully vaccinated by that October. ""Employees who fail to report their vaccination status by October 15, 2021, will be placed in a non-disciplinary, no pay status,"" a press release stated at the time. Lightfoot's mandate was not well received by workers, some of whom loudly booed her while speaking at a union fundraiser later that month. Those unions celebrated the most recent ruling.

""At issue in this case is whether an employer has an obligation to bargain over significant changes to terms and conditions of employment."" However, the mayor's office blasted the mandate repeal in a statement. ""The record before the Administrative Law Judge tells a completely different story. Yesterday's ruling was an erroneous decision that does not follow the law, facts nor importantly the science.

Nikki Haley taunts CNN's Don Lemon over firing: 'A great day for women everywhere',"The network announced it parted ways with the longtime host on Monday. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley isn't sad to see the departure of Don Lemon, who was suddenly terminated by CNN just hours after his final on-air appearance Monday. While CNN's official statement said that Lemon and the network ""parted ways,"" the embattled liberal anchor alleged he found out about his dismissal through his agent and took a swipe at CNN's leadership. A spokesperson disputed Lemon's statement as ""inaccurate."" Haley reacted to the stunning media news by taking a not-so-veiled shot at Lemon, promoting her ""Past My Prime?"" campaign koozies featuring cans of ""lemonade."" CNN FIRES DON LEMON, LEAVING LONGTIME ANCHOR ‘STUNNED’ ""A great day for women everywhere. Now, let's get men out of women’s sports. #StillInMyPrime,"" Haley tweeted.

(Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for THR) Haley's tweet was an overt reference to Lemon's controversial remarks in February when he claimed that the 51-year-old GOP hopeful was past her ""prime"" as she advocated for politicians over 75 to take a mandatory cognitive test. Lemon's comments were universally panned. Lemon's CNN colleagues fumed over his remarks, and he was the target of mockery from Biden spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre during a White House briefing.

Lemon, who had previously hosted a poorly-watched two-hour solo show in primetime, was pulled by Licht for a revamped morning show with co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, something he had repeatedly insisted was a ""promotion.""

Rep. Nancy Mace doubles down after sounding alarm on Hunter Biden business deals: 'Not a conspiracy theory',"Rep. Nancy Mace pushed back on those calling her a conspiracy theorist over comments she made about the Biden family and their business dealings during an appearance on CNN on Monday. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., pushed back on CNN host Kaitlan Collins and the notion that her remarks about allegations of corruption regarding the Biden family and Hunter Biden's business dealings were ""controversial"" as she called for a thorough investigation. Mace, along with several others on the House Oversight Committee, visited the Treasury Department on April 17 to review records related to the Biden family and their past business associates as part of their investigation into whether they pose a threat to national security. The ""CNN This Morning"" host told Mace that it was ""quite an allegation to make"" and asked if she had ""evidence."" ""Yes, it's not a conspiracy theory. There were over 170 suspicious activity reports. And I’m going to be very clear. I did that video right as I was walking out of the Treasury. And then the far left wanted to call me and label me a conspiracy theorist afterwards. It’s not a conspiracy. These were things that I read about while I was there and we’re talking about potentially up to a dozen Biden family members. And for years now, the left has said, no one is above the law. If that’s the case, put your money where your mouth is. Have this thing fully investigated to the fullest extent of the law. And if people, the average American saw what we saw, they would question why it’s not being investigated,"" Mace said.

But every time we overturn a stone, there’s more to be investigated, because you see another dumpster fire. And you’re like, what is going on and why is this happening?"" Mace continued. Collins said that the suspicious activity reports don't mean that ""wrongdoing has been committed"" and that not all of the information is verified. She asked Mace how she knows the information ""is verified to come out and make an allegation like that."" ""I would just ask the Justice Department to follow the money. There are more questions than answers and more Biden familles involved then we know and if it’s all above board, then say it’s all above board. But when you look at what’s going on and the sources of some of the funding that’s known and unknown and where it's going, you have a lot of questions and you’ll ask yourself why hasn’t this been investigated to the fullest extent of the law.

Marc Thiessen warns GOP against 'forcing' a 2020 rematch on voters: 'Get out of jail free card' for Biden,"Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how voters are sending a 'very clear message' regarding the 2024 presidential election. A Trump-Biden rematch in 2024 would be a ""get out of jail free card"" for President Biden one analyst warned, as the president is expected to launch his second bid for the White House this week. Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen argued a rematch with the veteran duo would get him off the hook for the ""serial disasters"" he has spurred while in office during ""America's Newsroom"" on Monday. ""Voters are sending a very clear message. They want different choices. They don't want a Trump-Biden rematch,"" Thiessen told Bill Hemmer Monday. ""So what happens if we force them to have that Trump-Biden rematch? Well, the Wall Street Journal poll last week has the answer. It said that among voters who disapprove of both Biden and Trump, Biden wins by 54 to 15%. So what that means is swing voters who dislike Joe Biden dislike Trump even more."" BIDEN EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE REELECTION BID SAME WEEK HUNTER'S LAWYERS MEET WITH DOJ ""So if we force that, the problem for the Republicans is to win the election, they've got to get the all those voters who disapprove of Joe Biden to vote for the Republican nominee, and Donald Trump is like a get out of jail free card for Joe Biden for all the political consequences of his serial disasters in office that we should be wrapping around his neck… like an albatross,"" he continued. Biden's re-election announcement is expected to take place on Tuesday through a pre-taped message, despite a bombshell new poll indicating a majority of Americans do not want him to seek a second term in office. According to the survey from NBC News, 70% of Americans, including 51% of Democrats, do not think Biden should run for re-election, with 26% supporting the president. Almost half of the respondents who voted no cited Biden's age as their ""major"" concern with Biden running again – 48% categorized their concern as ""major"" while 21% said it was a minor concern; 29% of respondents said the issue of his age did not pose a reason in their logic whatsoever. WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD SAYS BIDEN SHOULDN'T RUN IN 2024: 'HIS DECLINE IS CLEAR' Biden is currently the oldest president in U.S. history. He would be 82 years old during his potential second inauguration, and 86 years old at the end of a second term. But Thiessen doubled down on Biden's political record as motivation for what critics have called dismal polling amid the widespread concerns surrounding his age and mental fitness. ""Joe Biden is literally the most unpopular president in the history of polling since it's going back all the way to Harry Truman, and he… had the best midterm performance of any president going back to John F. Kennedy except for Bush after the 9/11 attacks,"" Thiessen said. ""That wasn't because voters approved of Biden, it's because they disapproved of the alternative, because we put up so many of these nominees who… their number one qualification was echoing Trump's election denial,"" he continued. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Thiessen argued that if Republicans choose a candidate other than Trump, voters can hold Biden accountable for the ""disasters"" he has caused through his demise at the ballot box. ""If Republicans choose somebody other than Trump – and don't get me wrong, he was a great president – but he's he's made himself toxic to those swing voters,"" Thiessen said. ""If we choose somebody else, then… we can make Biden own all of the disasters he's unleashed on the southern border, on the economy, on inflation, on gas prices. That's the way to make him own it."" Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. have already announced their candidacy for 2024, and will challenge Biden to secure the Democrat Party's nomination. Trump challengers for the 2024 Republican nomination include Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, Vivek Ramaswamy and Larry Elder. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., has formed an exploratory committee.

""He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter."" Last year, Lemon was pulled from his prestigious solo primetime gig to an ensemble morning show alongside co-anchors Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, but he insisted the move wasn’t a demotion. In fact, he went on CNN and said Licht offered him a ""promotion."" It didn’t take long for ""CNN This Morning"" to make tabloid news after the show's launch in November. On Dec. 8, during CNN's breaking news of Brittney Griner's release from Russia, there were multiple on-air instances in which Collins attempted to interject while Lemon was speaking. At one point, Lemon wagged his finger above the desk and told her ""stand by one second."" While off-air, however, Lemon got ""nasty"" at Collins, scolding her for interrupting him, which left her ""visibly upset,"" a source who witnessed the exchange told Fox News Digital. The New York Post first reported on the incident, causing headaches for CNN bosses. Lemon found himself in hot water again in February for saying that Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley was past her ""prime"" at age 51, citing Google as his source while stunning his female co-anchors in the process. Lemon offered a mea culpa during the network's editorial call the next day, but female colleagues weren’t pleased. DON LEMON SPOTTED AT THE BEACH AFTER PHONING IN APOLOGY TO CNN COLLEAGUES OVER SEXIST NIKKI HALEY COMMENTS Don Lemon has a long history of controversial rhetoric. He was fired by CNN on Monday. (CNN screenshot) Colleagues were further enraged when Lemon was spotted at Miami Beach after the insensitive remarks about Haley. Lemon was then ordered to take ""formal training,"" but he returned to his struggling morning show a few days later. A CNN insider told Fox News Digital in February that Lemon had ""no defenders"" inside the network over the situation and everyone was still ""pissed."" If he were forced out, ""it would probably be welcomed by a lot of people,"" they said at the time. ""I think there's an array of people who maybe like him personally, not professionally."" Lemon's ""prime"" comments were universally panned and not just by conservatives, receiving mockery from Biden spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre during a White House briefing and even making its way to this year's Oscars ceremony. Best Actress winner Michelle Yeoh told women in Hollywood, ""Don't let anybody tell you, you are ever past your prime."" Those remarks were hardly the first time Lemon’s on-air rhetoric sparked backlash among female viewers. In 2014, he infamously asked a Bill Cosby accuser why she didn’t simply bite his penis to prevent an alleged rape. Last September, he asked CNN analyst S.E. Cupp if she was suffering from ""mommy brain"" after she lost her train of thought during a panel discussion. In December, Lemon clashed with his female ""CNN This Morning"" co-hosts while arguing male athletes make more money than women because ""people are more interested in the men.""

(MEGA / GC Images / File) His recent streak of alienating female viewers comes after years of alienating conservative audiences, which was encouraged when CNN was run by Jeff Zucker, who was forced out of the network last year. Lemon, one of CNN's most openly left-wing voices, has compared Trump supporters to Ku Klux Klan members, defended Antifa, and fumed over people unvaccinated against coronavirus ""taking up the space"" in hospitals, among other news-making moments. CNN INSIDERS SAY DON LEMON HAS 'NO DEFENDERS' AT THE NETWORK, NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE TO KEEP ON-AIR Earlier this month, Variety published a bombshell report that revealed scandalous allegations about Lemon. The allegations included claims he sent threatening text messages to a colleague from a burner phone and repeatedly exhibited misogynistic and ""diva-like"" behavior. At the time, CNN defended Lemon and called the report ""riddled with patently false anecdotes"" and ""based on unsourced, unsubstantiated, 15-year-old anonymous gossip."" Licht, who has been on a crusade to ""tamp down spectacle"" at CNN, initially kept Lemon around during a housecleaning that saw polarizing hosts such as Brian Stelter exit.

CNN insider says staffers 'pissed' at network spending reported millions on Gayle King for weekly show,"'Gutfeld!' panelists discuss CNN's Don Lemon returning to his morning show after he made sexist comments about Nikki Haley. It was 16 months ago that CNN had a consistent programming lineup in primetime, something that is virtually unheard of in cable news. While trouble has been widespread for CNN as its viewership has significantly decline since President Trump left office, there has been panic for content in primetime after its scandal-plagued but highest-rated anchor Chris Cuomo was fired in December 2021. The content void further expanded when its poorly-watched host Don Lemon, who had a two-hour block in primetime, was pulled by CNN boss Chris Licht for a new morning show, which has only spawned additional headaches for the network. There has been a revolving door of fill-in hosts for the 9 p.m. ET vacancy from Jim Acosta to Jake Tapper, while Licht tapped Alisyn Camerota and Laura Coates to lead programming at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET respectively in recent months. CNN'S CHRIS LICHT SAYS HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR ‘ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY’ BECOMING CEO: A ‘SMACK IN THE FACE’ The only constant throughout the chaos has been ""Anderson Cooper 360"" in the 8 p.m. ET time slot, a program that frequently is not CNN's most-watched on a daily basis despite being in primetime. The content void further expanded when its host Don Lemon, who had a two-hour block in primetime that languished in the ratings, was pulled by CNN boss Chris Licht for a new morning show, ""CNN This Morning."" The show saw poor ratings but plenty of tabloid drama, and CNN fired Lemon on Monday, leaving the longtime anchor ""stunned."" ""Anderson Cooper 360"" remains as CNN's only permanent fixture in primetime but its ratings have continued flailing in recent years. (CNN) Recent developments show weeknight programming remains in flux. Coates is reportedly being pulled from the 11 p.m. ET slot due to lack of staff budgeting, leaving Camerota to do double duty from 10 p.m through midnight. And CNN also announced that ""Who's Talking to Chris Wallace?"" will be moving from Sundays nights at 7 p.m. to Friday nights at 10 p.m. ""This is just the latest shuffling of the deck chairs on the CNN Titanic,"" one former CNN producer told Fox News Digital. CNN INSIDERS BAFFLED WHY NETWORK STANDS BY DON LEMON AS CONTROVERSIES MOUNT: ‘ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYSTERIES’ Over the past several months, reports of CNN courting outside talent to solve their primetime debacle had emerged. CNN confirmed over the weekend that CBS News' Gayle King and NBA legend Charles Barkley will be teaming up for a weekly primetime show aptly titled ""King Charles,"" set to air on Wednesday nights this fall. Barkley, who confirmed talks with the network were taking place in February, called CNN a ""s--- show"" and signaled he would ""never"" do a daily show. TNT basketball analyst Charles Barkley is set to host a weekly primetime show on sister network CNN, which he openly referred to as a ""s--- show."" (Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports) CNN staffers were particularly irked at reported rumors that King, who previously worked with Licht when he was the executive producer of ""CBS This Morning,"" would receive a whopping $12 million salary for hosting one hour per week. The network has had significant budget cuts over the past year and also went through a wrenching round of layoffs at the end of 2022. ""People are pissed,"" one CNN insider told Fox News Digital. FOX NEWS VIEWERSHIP CRUSHES MSNBC, CNN FOR 110TH STRAIGHT WEEK AMONG BOTH TOTAL VIEWERS AND PRIMETIME A spokesman for CNN forcefully pushed back at the $12 million price tag that has been floated in the tabloids, calling that figure ""totally laughable"" and suggesting it was much lower. Another CNN insider was also chagrined at Coates, a Black woman who is also a legal analyst at the network, not having her own show, calling her well-liked and a team player. They predicted people at the network will be ""up in arms"" if the network doesn't do more to address diversity in primetime beyond a one-day-a-week show with King and Barkley. ""I hope management sees it the same way and we avoid a big bruhaha. We’ve had and continue to have enough of them,"" the insider said. The King-Barkley pairing, though, is a small antidote for CNN's primetime woes as it addresses only one hour of content on one weeknight instead of all five weeknights. It marks Licht's boldest programming move to date but in a memo to staff, he stopped short of declaring it a permanent solution for CNN by saying the show will air ""beginning this fall and running into 2024,"" perhaps giving him wiggle room to chalk it up as another primetime experiment in case it becomes another ratings dud. CNN staffers are ""pissed"" about the reported multi-million-dollar contract the network is offering CBS anchor Gayle King to host a show one night a week despite major budget cuts. (Michele Crowe/CBS via Getty Images) As CNN struggles to restore its primetime programming, Licht seemed to throw in the towel in landing a permanent host to save the network five nights a week, at least in the short term. In February, the network shifted its pitch to Variety, which ran the headline ""CNN Bets News, Not Big Names, Will Capture Crowds at 9 PM."" The premise was that the news would be the real star in primetime through town halls, high-profile interviews and other specials rather than a single TV personality to be the face of the time slot. But so far they have failed to juice CNN's ratings. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP In March, CNN averaged only 539,000 total viewers in primetime compared to Fox News' 2.1 million average and MSNBC's 1.2 million.

Vandals hit Utah Republican's home for bill banning gender surgeries for minors: 'I will not be silenced',"Utah State Sen. Mike Kennedy, R., discusses what happened to his home after sponsoring a bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors in his state.

Utah State Sen. Mike Kennedy (R) joined ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss the incident Monday, saying he was out of town when the vandals struck, adding that his neighbors helped by cleaning up some of the mess in his absence.

"Liberal celebs, journalists furious that Musk gave them their blue check back: 'Without my consent'","University of Texas students sound off after public figures denounced Twitter's plan to charge a verification fee under its new owner, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Liberal celebrities and journalists complained after Twitter CEO Elon Musk restored blue check marks to their Twitter profiles without requiring them to pay for verification. To have a verified account on the social media platform now users must pay $8 a month. Despite the new policy, Musk started restoring the badges to several accounts with over one million followers over the weekend and revealed he's ""personally paying"" for some accounts to retain their verified status. However, for many on the left, not having a blue check mark next to their Twitter profile became a sign of their resistance to Musk and his overhaul of Twitter. After finding out they received their check marks back, several outraged liberal celebrities and media personalities defended themselves.

"WSJ blasts Blinken, intel officials, media for spreading 'false' Hunter Biden laptop letter","Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the possible charges he could face as the investigation into the president's son continues. The Wall Street Journal editorial board blasted the former intelligence officials and Secretary of State Antony Blinken who orchestrated the infamous Hunter Biden disinformation letter shortly before the 2020 election, also calling out ""complicit media."" ""Intelligence officials, former as well as current, have a particular duty not to spread disinformation because they have access to classified information that the public can’t check. The press overwhelmingly went along with the false Biden campaign claims because it wanted Mr. Biden to win. These 51 officials have done more to damage the credibility of the CIA and FBI than anything Donald Trump has said. Ditto for the complicit media,"" the editorial board members wrote. Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell testified before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, and revealed that Blinken was ""the impetus"" of the public statement signed by intelligence officials in 2020.

Authorities face mounting pressure to release Nashville school shooter's manifesto: 'Very perplexing',"Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Biden inviting the 'Tennessee Three' to the White House, the latest on the Hunter Biden investigation, the war in Sudan and the migrant surge at the border. Authorities are facing mounting pressure to unveil the Nashville school shooter's manifesto to shed light on the motive behind the brutal massacre that left six people, including three children, dead last month. The FBI has been accused of stalling its release after officials reportedly found 20 journals, five laptops and a suicide note among other things at the shooter's home. The suspect, Audrey Hale, identified as trans and was a former student at The Covenant School before she carried out the deadly shooting last month. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., called it ""perplexing"" that officials have yet to release a motive or any of her writings nearly one month after the tragedy during ""Fox & Friends"" Monday. NASHVILLE SCHOOL SHOOTING: BIDEN CALLS ON REPORTERS TO FOCUS ON PTSD OF STUDENTS, TEACHERS ""It's been very perplexing to all of us involved,"" Hagerty said. ""It seems that certain information is flooded into the marketplace immediately if it fits the narrative, so to speak. If the information does not fit the narrative, it seems to get suppressed."" ""I don't know what's in the manifesto. I want to be sensitive to our law enforcement officers that are going through this, but it's certainly taking a long time to figure out whether and what information should be released,"" he continued. ""I think people do deserve to know what took place, what was in the mind of this sick person that committed these heinous murders.""

Tim Burchett, (R-Tenn.) expressed his disappointment to the New York Post, arguing the manifesto's release could ""answer a lot of questions,"" and should be released the lawmakers and families affected by the shooting. Metro Nashville Council Member Courtney Johnston also told the Post the manifesto, which officials have already claimed would not be released entirely, is a ""blueprint on total destruction."" ""That document in the wrong person’s hands would be astronomically dangerous,"" she said. BIDEN RIPPED FOR MEETING PROTESTING TN DEMS, NOT SHOOTING VICTIMS' FAMILIES Hagerty also slammed the White House for inviting the ""Tennessee Three,"" a group of state lawmakers who protested after the Nashville school shooting, to the White House but not the victims of the brutal massacre. ""I understand that this White House is focused entirely on politics. I'm certainly focused on… those who lost their lives,"" Hagerty said. ""We're doing we can to put in place legislation to harden schools, to protect these children, to protect the most vulnerable, and political stunts really are secondary and minor, I think, to everyone, certainly in Tennessee, that cares about the situation at Covenant School.""

The State House later voted to expel Jones and Pearson – but the duo were later essentially reinstated after the Shelby County Council and Nashville Metro Council respectively voted to place them in the newly-open seats. ""Certainly it was a stunt that took place on the floor of the Tennessee Senate. The bullhorns, all of the racket-making, they knew what the rules were,"" Hagerty said. ""But again, this just turned into something that I think the White House can make some political gains on. At least that's their calculation."" ‘TN THREE’ DEMOCRAT JUSTIN JONES PICTURED STANDING ON COP CAR DURING 2020 BLM PROTEST ""I wish they would instead focus on the victims of this horrendous murder,"" he continued. Fox News' Peter Doocy pressed White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the topic last week, asking her if any of the shooting victims' families had been invited to the White House. ""Monday, you're going to have three of the lawmakers who protested,"" Doocy said. Jean-Pierre interrupted him, noting they were ""peacefully"" protesting. ""Who peacefully protested after the Nashville Covenant School shooting,"" Doocy continued. ""Have any of the victims or the victims families been invited to the White House?"" ""I don't have anything to read out to you about any invite,"" Jean-Pierre replied. Hagerty accused the Biden administration of being more focused on sculpting the ""narrative,"" as opposed to the reality of the situation. ""We've got an administration in the White House that's far more focused on press releases, spin and politics than they are on substance and reality,"" Hagerty said.

Matt Taibbi rips media silence after Dem threat: 'Can you imagine' if GOP threatened to jail CNN’s Jim Acosta?,"Twitter Files journalist Matt Taibbi speaks out on Fox & Friends about his minor mistake that prompted Democratic Rep. Stacey Plaskett to threaten him with prison time. Independent journalist Matt Taibbi, who was threatened with jail time by a top Democrat on Capitol Hill over testimony he gave about his reporting on the Twitter Files, feels the media would have lost its minds if Republicans did the same to CNN's Jim Acosta. ""Can you imagine if something like this had happened in the Trump years? If Republicans had threatened someone like Jim Acosta with five years in prison over a minor error? That he didn’t even make in testimony before Congress? You would have had every human rights organization on earth complaining about it but not a peep from my so-called colleagues in mainstream media,"" Taibbi said Monday on ""FOX & Friends."" ""It doesn’t matter what journalist it is, they should be upset about it because it could be them next,"" Taibbi added. Del. Stacey Plaskett, D-Virgin Islands, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, sent a letter to Taibbi earlier this month regarding his testimony during a March 9 hearing, which she alleged included an error regarding the name of one of the federal agencies swept up in the Twitter Files. She cited MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan's contentious interview with Taibbi on the matter. Independent journalist Matt Taibbi was threatened with jail time by a top Democrat on Capitol Hill over testimony he gave about his reporting on the Twitter Files. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) ""It was a very minor mistake,"" Taibbi said to Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade. The error was a specific reference to CISA, the government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, when he meant to refer to CIS, the Center for Internet Security, which is a private organization. Taibbi later addressed and corrected the error in his reporting. Plaskett pointed to Taibbi's statement in her letter, writing it is ""contradicted by your own admission."" JOURNALIST MATT TAIBBI THREATENED WITH PRISON TIME FOR PERJURY BY TOP DEMOCRAT OVER TWITTER FILES TESTIMONY ""This mistake is important because, by adding an ‘A,' you weren't making a harmless spelling error. Rather, you were alleging that CISA — a government entity — was working with the EIP [Election Integrity Partnership] to have posts removed from social media,"" Plaskett wrote to Taibbi, according to a letter obtained by journalist and fellow Twitter Files reporter Lee Fang on Thursday. ""When presented with this misinformation, you acknowledged you had made ‘an error’ by intentionally altering the acronym CIS and you subsequently deleted your erroneous tweet."" Plaskett continued, ""Prior to your appearance before the subcommittee on March 9, you signed the Judiciary Committee's Truth in Testimony form, certifying that you understand that ‘knowingly providing material false information to this committee/subcommittee or knowingly concealing material information from this committee/subcommittee, is a crime (18 U.S.C. 1001). In addition, at the beginning of the March 9 hearing, you swore ‘under penalty of perjury that the testimony you [were] about to give [was] true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief.' Under the federal perjury statue, 18 U.S.C. 1621, proving false information is punishable by up to five years imprisonment."" Democratic Congresswomen Stacey Plaskett and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz both questioned journalist Matt Taibbi during a House hearing on March 9, 2023.  (House Judiciary ) But as Fang noted in his reporting, the specific comments Taibbi told Congress that Plaskett cited ""were correct"" despite the original error in his Twitter Files reporting. Taibbi called his error a ""brain cramp"" and noted both that both groups actually partnered with state entities. CNN’s Oliver Darcy did not mention the threats against Taibbi in his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter that covers the media industry and often frets about attacks on journalists. Darcy and liberal media colleagues have been largely dismissive of the Twitter Files reporting; at one point, several left-wing reporters were left embarrassed when they used clearly coordinated language to accuse Taibbi on Twitter of doing ""PR work"" for the ""world's richest man."" MSNBC HOST FEUDS WITH MATT TAIBBI OVER TWITTER FILES, DODGES RUSSIAGATE COVERAGE CRITICISM: ‘I WASN’T THERE' CNNs Jim Acosta was once temporarily banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with President Trump during a press conference that included briefly contacting a female White House aide who was attempting to take the microphone.  ((REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) ) A CNN spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked if Acosta had comment on Taibbi’s comparison. In 2018, Acosta was serving as CNN’s senior White House correspondent when the Trump-era White House had his press pass suspended. While he wasn’t facing anything close to jail time, the media industry largely rallied around him. Acosta’s ""hard pass,"" which provides expedited access to the White House grounds, was suspended after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a press conference, at one point refusing to pass the microphone to a female White House aide. His pass was restored after CNN argued that it violated the network and Acosta’s First and Fifth Amendment rights. Acosta, who how hosts a staunchly left-wing weekend program for CNN, emerged as one of the most outspokenly liberal White House reporters during the Trump era, earning a book deal in the process. He was criticized by colleagues for a showboating style that was heavier on style than substance. Taibbi had a falling out with Musk after the billionaire tech tycoon cracked down on content from the subscription newsletter platform Substack, which Taibbi publishes his work on.

Lizzo protests Tennessee policy by bringing drag performers on stage: 'Celebrate our differences',"Country star Maren Morris told her over 1.6 million fans on Instagram that she took her young, two-year-old son to meet drag queens in an unapologetic video. Grammy-award winning pop star and social activist Lizzo invited drag performers on stage in Tennessee after the state became the first in the nation to ban such performances on public property and near schools. ""In light of recent and tragic events and current events, I was told by people on the internet, ‘Cancel your shows in Tennessee,’ ‘Don’t go to Tennessee,'"" Lizzo said during her performance. ""Their reason was valid, but why would I not come to the people who need to hear this message the most?"" ""The people who need to feel this release the most?"" Lizzo said to cheers in the crowd. ""Why would I not create a safe space in Tennessee where we can celebrate drag entertainers and celebrate our differences and celebrate fat, Black, women?"" the singer added.

(Robert Okine/Getty Images) Tennessee became the first state to ban drag shows on public property and near schools. The law, which takes effect on July 1, criminalizes performances that take place in public or where they could be seen by children. The bill prohibits ""adult cabaret performances"" from taking place within 1,000 feet of schools, public parks or places of worship, according to The Hill. The legislation builds on existing restrictions on ""adult-oriented businesses"" in Tennessee, expanding obscenity laws there to include performances that feature topless or exotic dancers or ""male or female impersonators"" that provide entertainment appealing ""to a prurient interest."" LIZZO PROMOTES ABORTION RIGHTS IN 'SIZE INCLUSIVE' LINGERIE LINE: 'MY BODY IS NOBODY'S BUSINESS' Lizzo performed in Knoxville, Tennessee over the weekend. (Henryk Sadura via Getty Images) One popular drag performer who goes by the stage name ""Aquaria"" responded directly to Lizzo's Instagram post on her performance. ""Thank you so much for the platform for me and the drag race girls and especially for uplifting the queens on Tennessee! Those ladies are all so strong and brave and I know tonight was definitely the best of a tricky situation for everyone. Thanks for shedding light for our friends who definitely need our hand these days. We appreciate it,"" the drag performer wrote. Several other states, including Idaho, Kentucky, North Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma and Utah, are considering similar bans on drag performances. The governor of Arkansas recently signed a bill that puts new restrictions on ""adult-oriented"" performances. While initially targeting drag shows, that bill was scaled back after complaints of discrimination. The Tennessee drag show ban was temporarily blocked in March by a federal judge. Lizzo also shouted out Sesame Street character Elmo during her performance, with the popular children's show puppet making an appearance. Elmo's official Instagram account later commented on Lizzo's post, writing that he felt ""special"" for being able to speak during Lizzo's performance.

BBC responds to 'Great Expectations' BDSM scene: 'Reading between the lines',"The Five co-hosts discuss a British publisher pushing for more inclusive language in Roald Dahl’s classic childrens books. Charlotte Moore, the chief content officer of BBC, defend her network’s choice to feature a BDSM scene in the mini-series adaptation of Charles Dickens’ ""Great Expectations."" Viewers were recently shocked by a scene in the second episode that featured the character Mr. Pumblechook being spanked over a bed by Mrs. Gargery. Amid viewers and fans of the original novel criticized this scene and other dark moments in the show, Moore stated that she ""believes absolutely everything [in the show] comes from what was alluded to"" ""[Y]ou have to really understanding what [Dickens] would have felt able to write about [in the Victorian era] and read between the lines,"" Moore told the Broadcasting Press Guild in London on Thursday. A general view shows the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Television Centre in west London. (REUTERS/Toby Melville) When asked why the network decided to adapt the classic novel in this way, Moore responded, ""Because I think it’s a great way to bring loved texts to new audiences, and to find new interpretations,"" and that it can ""push the boundaries of storytelling,"" and ""reinvent [classic novels] for a modern age."" NEW ADAPTATION OF CHARLES DICKENS’ ‘GREAT EXPECTATIONS’ RIPPED FOR BDSM SCENE: ‘UNWATCHABLE’ The show also portrayed the character Miss Havisham, played by Olivia Coleman, as an opium addict. In an interview with the BBC, the show’s screenwriter Steven Knight similarly defended the creative choice by claiming that Dickens was restricted by the elements of his time. ""You couldn’t write about certain things in Dickens’ time: certain elements of sexuality, crime, disobedience against the crown and state. What I tried to do was imagine if Dickens was writing the story now and had the freedom to go to those darker places, what would he do? If he had been liberated to write the things that were going on that he wasn’t allowed to write about,"" Knight said. An employee at Sothebys holds an 1843 first edition of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens in London, U.K., Tuesday, December 5, 2006. (Photo by Suzanne Plunkett/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Regarding the scene itself, Knight also defended the racy undertones, arguing for a deeper reading into the text. ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 19, 1843, CHARLES DICKENS PUBLISHES ‘A CHRISTMAS CAROL’ ""So I think if you take a microscope to the text of Dickens – for example, Pumblechook and Mrs Gargery, there are a couple of lines in there where they disappear together,"" Knight said. ""And I think that a Victorian readership were a bit more forensic about what was going on.""

Christian university blocks Maoist China survivor from speaking over anti-woke views: 'Extra concerning',"Survivor of Mao’s Revolution Xi Van Fleet and Virginia father of four Joe Mobley slam state Democrats for opposing a bill to teach the history of communism and react to a school board member calling Iwo Jima ‘unfortunate’ The student government at Whitworth University denied a Republican group's request to invite Xi Van Fleet, a survivor of Maoist China, to speak on campus, citing her criticism of ""woke culture"" and her comparisons of the ideology to her experience under communist rule. The student government at Whitworth University, a private Christian university in Spokane, Washington, voted 9-4 to reject the Turning Point USA chapter’s request to host Van Fleet during a meeting on April 12, arguing that her positions, represented by her tweets critical of woke culture, could be deemed ""hurtful or offensive,"" Campus Reform reported. The Virginia mother, who endured Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution before immigrating to the U.S., has emerged as an outspoken opponent of critical race theory and frequently warns about similarities she sees between the ""woke revolution"" and her experience living under Mayo Zedong's Chinese Cultural Revolution, including the suppression of opposing viewpoints.

(Fox News) Grace Stiger, president of the Turning Point USA chapter at Whitworth University said she wanted Van Fleet to ""tell her story,"" and provide students with a unique perspective as a survivor under Zedong's rule. But the student government objected to Stiger's request, citing Van Fleet's anti-woke tweets, which they said targets diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), Black Lives Matter, the LGBTQ community and ""environmental justice"" among other social justice initiatives, Campus Reform reported. Van Fleet denounced the student government's decision to block her from speaking in an interview with the website, calling it ""extra concerning that this happened [at] a Christian college, which is supposedly more conservative."" ""What are they afraid of?"" she asked. ""Those people who believe in lived experience, then they are going to get the lived experience from me because I’m not talking about an idea that I read or researched or studied."" Van Fleet said that while she is ""not surprised at all"" and is ""very familiar with what’s happening on American campuses,"" she hopes students will learn from the history of China's Cultural Revolution.

"Guns, fear and the media: Experts explain the shifting gun culture in America","Dr. David Yamane and Dr. Kevin Gilliland dissect the evolution of gun culture in the U.S. and how recent shootings have created an increased fear of guns on ‘Sunday Night in America.’ Guns have always been a central feature of American culture. However, over the years the culture surrounding gun usage has shifted. Sociologist Dr. David Yamane and psychologist Dr.Kevin Gilliland explain on ""Sunday Night in America"" how the uptick in senseless violence across America has created a heightened sense of fear and an increased need for self-defense in Americans. ""I think we have to start by recognizing that guns have always been a fairly normal part of American culture. But the reasons that people owned guns have evolved over time and people have always had firearms for self-defense,"" Dr. Yamane said, going on to explain how the ""core"" of American gun culture has seen an evolution motivated by self-defense. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS AMERICANS FOR GUN SAFETY ""In the past 30 to 40 years, the self-defense motivation has really moved to the core of American gun culture. So this is what I call gun culture 2.0, the second evolution of American gun culture. Not everybody owns guns for self-defense, but a lot of people do,"" he said. On the topic of the fear surrounding guns and the increased importance of self-defense, Dr. Gilliland highlighted the role of the media and social platforms creating a heightened sense of concern surrounding violence.

Gun shops report increase in sales since the Connecticut school massacre.  (REUTERS/Gene Blevins/File Photo) ""It's the fearful, isolated, rhetoric filled individual that feels such a great need to defend themselves all the time and everywhere. And it's hard to value another human when you're not connected to them, even when your view of them comes from social media news and not the unbiased stuff that you and I grew up on that went away in 1987 when the FCC got rid of the fairness right, the fairness rules for media, the Fairness Doctrine. So what we did is what we look for in those,"" he said, discussing the effect these sources have on people's psyche. ""And the more you fill your head, your psyche, and the more you read and watch, the more you get disrupted, and you feel far more vulnerable. And now fear and anxiety and worry starts to make choices, including protecting yourself,"" Dr. Gilliland continued, addressing how social media does not only impact adolescents negatively but adults as well. When asked about the increased coverage of violence in today's media, Dr. Gilliland explained how the constant news of aggression contributes to the heightened fear and anxiety in individuals. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We do have a greater knowledge of it without question than we ever did again. We used to grow up with the worries that existed in our community, and we weren't able to pursue or have information pushed our direction. There's absolutely an element of that.

New York Times admits Biden should take 'concerns about his age seriously',"Former D.C. Democratic Party Chair Scott Bolden and former John Boehner aide Terry Holt joined Fox News Live to discuss the upcoming announcement ahead of the presidential election. President Biden needs to ""take voters’ concerns about age seriously"" before campaigning for his second term, the New York Times editorial board wrote on Saturday. The editorial acknowledged that ""many Democrats, particularly younger ones, are worried that he will simply be too old to be effective in a second term"" citing a poll that showed only 47% of Democrats want Biden to run again. More concerning, the article noted, was the Biden administration’s hesitation on the topic of his age, despite Biden’s plans to announce his second term on Tuesday. ""Concerns about age — both in terms of fitness for office and being out of touch with the moment — are legitimate…But Mr. Biden has given voters very few chances to do just that — to watch him — and his refusal to engage with the public regularly raises questions about his age and health,"" the editorial board wrote. U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce his campaign for president on Tuesday. ((Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)) In previous articles, New York Times writers have remarked that Biden’s age as a ""sensitive topic"" and ""uncomfortable issue"" regarding the president. Though the editorial board claimed that Biden’s State of the Union address presented an ""effective defense"" for critics of his age, appearances like that, the editors wrote, are rare. WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD SAYS BIDEN SHOULDN’T RUN IN 2024: ‘HIS DECLINE IS CLEAR’ ""He has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than most of his modern predecessors. Since 1923, only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan took fewer questions per month from reporters, and neither represents a model of presidential openness that Mr. Biden should want to emulate. His reticence has created an opening for critics and skeptics,"" the New York Times wrote. The article follows an editorial from the Wall Street Journal that argued Biden’s decline from his old age was ""clear to anyone who isn’t willfully blind"" from his lack of press conferences. President Biden would be 82 years old in 2024. (Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""The public understands what Mr. Biden apparently won’t admit: that electing an octogenarian in obvious decline for another four years could be an historic mistake,"" the Jouranl editorial board wrote. Biden would be 82-years-old if he wins a second term and currently holds the record as the oldest president to ever hold office. Over the past few years, multiple media outlets have expressed doubts about Biden’s ability to run again due to his age. ABC’S TERRY MORAN ‘SENSES’ MOST AMERICANS DON’T WANT ’81-YEAR-OLD RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT’ ""If Mr. Biden runs again, as he recently said he intends to, questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job,"" the Times editorial stated. ""If he runs again, Mr. Biden will need to provide explicit reassurance to voters; many of them have seen family members decline rapidly in their 80s. Americans are watching what Mr. Biden says and does, just as he has asked them to do."" Mainstream media outlets have shown concerns over President Biden's age ahead of 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP More recently, ABC's Terry Moran acknowledged on ""This Week"" that voters are likely reluctant to support Biden for his age. ""My own sense is that most Americans don’t want to vote for an 81-year-old running for president, neither do they really want to vote for a 77-year-old running for president. They'd like to go to the next generation. And I think part of the modesty is the Biden White House operation aware that people are uneasy with his age,"" Moran said.

Concerns grow as US military faces recruitment crisis for second year in a row: 'Cultural rot' is spreading,"Retired NAVY Seal Mike Sarraille discusses the U.S. military struggling to meet its recruiting goals for the second year in a row and a poll that found only 13% of young adults are willing to enlist on 'Fox News Live.' A retired Navy SEAL is sounding the alarm about a declining number of young men and women willing to serve in the U.S. military. Mike Sarraille, now an author and entrepreneur, said weak leadership and ""cultural rot"" is playing a role in declining recruitment and retention. A November 2022 survey from the Ronald Reagan Institute found trust and confidence in the U.S. military stands at 48%, down from 70% in November 2018. The primary reason for the more than 20-point decline was the ""perceived politicization of the military,"" according to a press release from the organization. TOP GUN MAVERICK: NAVY, AIR FORCE LOOK FOR RECRUITMENT BOOST FOLLOWING BIG OPENING FOR TOM CRUISE SEQUEL (Fox News) A second survey also found only 13% of 18-29-year-olds are ""highly willing"" to join the military. Twenty-five percent are ""somewhat willing"" and 26% are ""not willing at all."" Sarraille argued one reason so few Americans are unable to serve is because of health reasons. ""I think it should send shockwaves through America that we've lowered our standards to such depths. We're in a culture where everyone gets a trophy. Obesity is the new beautiful,"" he explained on ""Fox News Live."" ""And if you fail or don't even try- don't worry- it's somebody else's fault. When you look at leadership, strong leadership, leadership that people respect and trust, they're willing to contribute and sacrifice for the collective good. Now, the juxtaposition to that is weak leadership, the crisis of confidence [where] people pull inward to protect themselves and their immediate families. And they're not willing to sacrifice for the cause they deem unworthy,"" he continued. ""But I'm not going to put this on the younger generation. If we can actually get them into the military, we can actually get them to a physical standard that they need to be. This generation is the next best generation. We just have to hold them to the standards of old."" (Fox News) NORTH CAROLINA MAN, ONCE OBESE, INSPIRED BY NAVY SEAL TO QUIT DRINKING, GET FIT AND RADICALLY ALTER HIS LIFE The military officer added that the U.S. needs to start training the younger generation to be the leaders the country needs for the future. ""I think a good sort of contrast here is there was a commercial by the Russians where they showed young men resolute, ready to do violence on behalf of their nation. And then the contrast to that is the U.S. Army that showed a video of a young soldier and her two mothers,"" he said. ""We're sending some very dangerous narratives. We have to have pride in our nation."" Air Force recruiters are seen at the Hyundai Air & Sea Show in Miami Beach, Florida, in May 2022. (Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Sarraille shared that joining the military was the greatest decision he ever made because it helped him grow from a young boy into a man and laid the foundation for his success.

The Netflix series faced intense backlash after the first trailer for the latest season of ""African Queens"" featured Cleopatra portrayed by Adele James, a dark-skinned actress. Gharavi remarked on this backlash, calling the comments that she faced as ""laughable."" ""While shooting, I became the target of a huge online hate campaign. Egyptians accused me of ‘blackwashing’ and ‘stealing’ their history. Some threatened to ruin my career — which I wanted to tell them was laughable. I was ruining it very well for myself, thank you very much! No amount of reasoning or reminders that Arab invasions had not yet happened in Cleopatra’s age seemed to stem the tide of ridiculous comments. Amir in his bedroom in Cairo wrote to me to earnestly appeal that ‘Cleopatra was Greek!’ Oh, Lawd! Why would that be a good thing to you, Amir? You’re Egyptian,"" Gharavi wrote. Egyptian archeologists discovered a tunnel some believe could lead to the tomb of Cleopatra (Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities via Storyful) She acknowledged ""what a political act it would be to see Cleopatra portrayed by a Black actress"" but insisted that ""what the historians can confirm is that it is more likely that Cleopatra looked like Adele than Elizabeth Taylor ever did."" NETFLIX’S ‘QUEEN CLEOPATRA’ ADAPTATION SUED BY EGYPTIAN LAWYER: A ‘FORGERY’ ""Why shouldn’t Cleopatra be a melanated sister? And why do some people need Cleopatra to be white? Her proximity to whiteness seems to give her value, and for some Egyptians it seems to really matter,"" she wrote. Despite that claim, many Egyptians have similarly attacked the portrayal as historically inaccurate. On Wednesday, Egyptian lawyer Mahmoud al-Semary filed a lawsuit against Netflix for the series, calling for an investigation into Netflix management as well a block on the streaming service in Egypt. ""Most of what Netflix platform displays do not conform to Islamic and societal values and principles, especially Egyptian ones,"" the complaint read. Netflix was sued by an Egyptian lawyer for the portrayal of Queen Cleopatra in an upcoming series.

She continued, ""I am proud to stand with ‘Queen Cleopatra’ — a re-imagined Cleopatra — and with the team that made this. We re-imagined a world over 2,000 years ago where once there was an exceptional woman who ruled.

Rep. Comer questions Biden family deals: 'What were these family members doing to receive this money?',"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., discusses the investigation into the Biden family influence, the number of family members involved in alleged peddling and the DOJ meeting with Hunter Biden's lawyers. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., joined ""Sunday Morning Futures"" and shared with host Maria Bartiromo the latest on the investigation into the Biden family business deals. The Kentucky Congressman alleged that there were more family members involved in the deals, warning that the family could be ‘in a pickle.' HUNTER BIDEN LAWYERS TO MEET WITH DOJ OFFICIALS NEXT WEEK AS FEDERAL INVESTIGATION CRITICISM INTENSIFIES REP. JAMES COMER: … We went into Treasury after a long battle to have access to those Treasury reports, thinking that there was a certain number of suspicious activity reports, the number that had been previously reported. And we thought that there were two or three Biden family members that would be implicated in these bank violations. Nearly three weeks later, we walk out of Treasury. Having read, pored over thousands of pages of documents, and I can tell you that there were more suspicious activity reports that had been previously reported and many more Biden family members that were involved in the influence-peddling scheme. We now have nine and counting Biden family members who were zinged by at least one bank for receiving suspicious wires from our adversaries around the world. …Through our informants and through our research over the past year and through other investigative reporting, we thought there were around a dozen of these LLCs that were created by Biden family members to disguise or launder where the source of the revenue was coming from. But there are many more LLCs. There are many more Biden family members, many more LLCs, and many more countries that were involved… the question remains, what were these family members doing to receive this money? There's no rhyme or reason for some of these Biden family members to receive any type of payment from our adversaries around the world, much less the number that we've uncovered, and we're still digging through these bank violations.

North Carolina educators tout 'My Place in Race' DEI workshop for middle schoolers: 'Important for all ages',"DEI efforts are expanding at universities across the country. A race-based workshop in an Asheville-area North Carolina middle school was touted as ""important for all ages"" to discuss diversity, equity and inclusion in light of America's tense racial climate, but some argue the instruction could divide more than unite. Teachers at Evergreen Community Charter School hosted the workshop on Friday where discussions of diversity and inclusion led the event. Discussions also focused on the history of race and how the subject should be taught. ""These are hard issues,"" Jennifer Watkins, associate director at the institution said, according to ABC 13 in Asheville. ""It’s hard for people to understand different perspectives. But one key thing we really need to do is to practice having discussions."" PENTAGON DISBANDS DEO UNIT AFTER CHIEF ACCUSED OF ‘RACISM’ AGAINST WHITES, INJECTS AGENDA DEEPER INTO AGENCY Middle school students were given a space to attend a workshop on ‘My Place in Race’ on Friday. (istock) Similarly, Heather Tate, who organized the event, praised the workshop for sparking conversations about race. Her take was shared on the Crisis in the Classroom Twitter account. ""It's important for all ages, from kindergarten to three-year-olds to grown folks to middle schoolers to be having conversations about racial equity and race in our country,"" she said. The notion raises concerns among those who allege the content incites division and perpetuates some controversial principles found in critical race theory, a system of thought that observes the way power structures and systems – namely government and corporations – disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. OPINION: ‘RACISTS ANONYMOUS’ IS JUST ONE OF THE INSANE WAYS UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA HAS BEEN CONQUERED BY DEI Critical race theory – a school of thought dedicate to observing the systemic oppression of racial and ethnic minorities – continues to divide educators, administrators and parents. (Getty Images) The allegedly ""racist"" ideology has become increasingly widespread in recent years, infiltrating top medical schools, K-12 schools, as well as private schools and other university departments across the U.S. Some argue, though the conversations may be appropriate for older students, others are too young. Among those concerned is the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank who alleged the workshop would create a victim mentality centered around inherent characteristics such as race and gender. ""[The theory] replaces Marx’s conception of class struggle with an oppressor/oppressed dynamic based on identity groups, such as race and gender,"" the foundation argued, according to ABC 13. COLLEGE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OFFIICERS RAKE IN SKY-HIGH SALRIES AS DEBT-SADDLED STUDENTS FACE RISING COSTS DEI has similarly taken center stage in the education wars as many public schools and universities implement DEI-focused programs or hire DEI officers who rake in lucrative salaries. Such positions gained national attention in recent weeks, most notably at Stanford University, where a DEI Dean Tirien Steinbach confronted Trump-appointed judge Kyle Duncan as protests broke out during his talk on campus. Other DEI-focused initiatives have led institutions to question gender norms, advocating for differential recognition between gender and sex as well as calling for enhanced inclusion among minority groups in school and work settings.

McCarthy accuses Biden of ignoring GOP over debt ceiling negotiations as talks stall: 'Rests upon his feet',"Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Republicans' proposal and why Biden's action is 'risky' as the battle over government spending continues. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy demanded President Biden return to the negotiating table for debt ceiling negotiations, as talks remain stalled over key spending cuts and a potential increase to the ceiling overall. McCarthy accused the president of stifling a deal during ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" after Biden dismissed the Republican spending proposal as ""wacko"" and ""irresponsible."" ""I think as president and the leader of the free world, this is one of the problems,"" McCarthy told Maria Bartiromo. ""We have challenges around this country, around the world. He needs to show leadership and come to the negotiating table instead of putting us in default. This is risky, what he's doing."" ""He's threatening the markets. Think of his ideas in the next month. If you actually have good credit, you pay more. If you have bad credit, you get a discount. Who believes in these types of ideas?"" he continued. ""This goes against everything, what America was created upon that if you work hard, you can succeed, and that's the difference. Come to the table, negotiate and do what is right.""WALL STREET SHOULD BE 'CONCERNED' ABOUT DEBT LIMIT STANDOFF WITH BIDEN: MCCARTHY McCarthy and other House Republicans unveiled a plan last week to cut government spending in various ways while also raising the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion. The plan would slash spending for the IRS, Democrats' green energy agenda, and unused COVID-related funding. But McCarthy said the president has yet to respond to House lawmakers about the proposal. ""This rests upon his feet, not because he made a bad decision. The real decision is he's afraid to even negotiate,"" McCarthy said. HOUSE WILL VOTE SOON TO CAP FEDERAL SPENDING AT 2022 LEVEL, RAISE DEBT LIMIT FOR ONE YEAR: MCCARTHY Biden addressed the GOP-led proposal last week, dismissing it as ""wacko"" and shifting blame as negotiations remain at a standstill. ""Folks, here's this really dangerous MAGA Republican congressman threatening to default on the national debt, the debt that took 230 years to accumulate overall… unless we do what they say,"" Biden said during a speech last week. ""They say they're going to default unless I agree to all these wacko notions they have."" ""Default would be worse and totally irresponsible,"" he continued. But McCarthy insisted there was never any threat, and he is actually the one to blame for the delay. ""We're the only ones in Washington that are actually putting a responsible plan out that will raise the debt limit,"" he said. ""Think about it; for more than 80 days it's been since I sat down with the president on February 1st to negotiate, to work through this, and he's ignored it.""

""These political stunts you're seeing from Speaker McCarthy and the MAGA wing – this is dangerous. These are political stunts that will have long-lasting effects."" McCarthy said he is hopeful to have a vote on the budget proposal by the end of this coming week. If it passes, with what he called a ""very slim majority,"" it will head to the Senate for another vote. ""I cannot imagine someone in our conference that would want to go along with Biden's reckless spending. This is responsible. This is something that we have sat down for months that everybody's had input in,"" McCarthy said. ""It's not where everybody gets 100% of what they want, but when we send this to the Senate, we're showing that, yes, we're able to raise the debt ceiling into the next year."" ""What we're doing is we're being responsible fiscally and bringing our house back in order,"" he continued. ""It doesn't solve all of our problems, but it gets us on the right path and this gets us to the negotiating table, just as government and America expects us to do.""

Gen Z voters highlight their picks from 2024's 'star-studded' GOP lineup: We need 'real leadership',"Gen Z guests Isabel Brown, Jahmiel Jackson and Jahmarri Green join ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" to discuss their preferred candidates going into the 2024 election cycle and employer complaints that Gen Z workers are easily offended. Generation Z is stealing the spotlight in the workforce and abroad – months after stealing the GOP's shot at a ""red wave"" in last November's midterms. The notoriously progressive age bracket proves Republicans have a lot of work to do to win over young voters going into 2024 by finding a way to resonate with the generation that's locked into the digital age. But for those among the generation who already opt for Republicans, the star-studded 2024 presidential lineup introduces a bounty of options. To weigh in on their top picks for 2024 and the issues driving their vote, a panel of Gen Z Republicans joined Fox News' Rachel Campos-Duffy on Sunday. GEN Z DEFENDS CANCEL CULTURE AS ‘POSITIVE THING’ ON DR PHIL ‘ZOOMERS VS BOOMERS’ DEBATE Entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy, left, former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are among the preferred candidates for Gen Z Republicans. (Getty Images) ""It's a really exciting time,"" Turning Point USA contributor Isabel Brown said. ""I have so enjoyed following Vivek's [Ramaswamy] campaign as he's shaking things up in the political world and look forward to seeing what might happen in my new home state of Florida."" Jahmiel Jackson, a writer for The Chicago Thinker, said he has his eyes set on either Ramaswamy or Trump, but he argued that GOP leaders' rhetoric emphasizing God and faith – including Ramaswamy's statement that ""God should not be a four-letter word"" and Trump's pledge to reassert Judeo-Christian values if elected – should assume a more policy-based approach. ""I don't think this should be just a general conversation about God. I think there should be actual policies that tie into the current problems in our country. One policy idea I'm really looking forward to someone talking about is: Why don't we tie community service graduation requirements to churches? Make students do some community service in their churches."" GEN Z SAYS THIS EMOJI IS ‘PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE’ – ARE YOU STILL USING IT? Social media is one of the driving influences for Generation Z, according to the age group. One alleged TikTok's influencer trend is creating a more toxic work environment and less motivation for young workers. (Yui Mok / PA Images via Getty Images / File) He said the proposal would help socialize kids and curb skyrocketing crime in the process of bringing younger generations closer to God.COULD AI THREATEN GEN Z'S CAREER PROSPECTS? COLLEGE STUDENTS REVEAL CONCERNS Jahmarri Green, a member of Young Americans for Freedom, said he supports former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, but he is also keeping an eye out for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his bid for the presidency in the near future. ""[I support] Team Haley with everything that they do,"" he said. ""I've been with her since what she's done in South Carolina, what she's done in the U.N. and, hopefully, what she'll do in the future. I'm Camp Haley – all for it right now."" Green said his reason for considering DeSantis involves his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caught criticism from the left for allegedly prolonging exposure to the virus by refusing to follow widespread school or business lockdowns similar to those in other areas of the country. Another issue resonating in the minds of young voters is transgender ideology – particularly gender-affirming care for minors and the pull from left-wing progressives who encourage minors to receive such care under arguably consequential circumstances. ""This has become the forefront conversation of our generation,"" Brown said. ""We're impossibly opening all of our social media apps to find biological men speaking for women and the other way around. Children are being pushed into irreversible chemical and surgical castration before they even go through puberty. Now, 20% of our generation is identifying as LGBTQ+, so it absolutely is an issue that we're seeking real leadership on, not just to protect the innocence of those who come after us but to help dig Gen Z out of this big question that we have really been pushed into by the radical left,"" she continued. Brown, Jackson and Green also weighed in on a recent survey that found managers find Gen Z employees ""difficult"" to work with, particularly because of a sense of ""entitlement"" and their tendency to be ""easily offended."" Jackson said he believes the problem originated with TikTok. ""We are the generation of social influencers. And we have so many social influencers making well over seven-figure salaries doing nothing. They have no skills, no college degree, no mastery, no nothing, and they're getting paid this much money. Most of Gen Z – about 68% – are on TikTok, comparing our lives to them,"" he said. He added that Gen Z's ""reward system"" is ""vastly different"" from that of previous generations.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Taylor Penley is a production assistant with Fox News.

WI attorney reacts to trans woman flashing male genitalia at girls in locker room shower: 'Keep our kids safe',"Dan Lennington, Deputy Counsel at the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, discusses a firestorm brought on by a locker room incident at a Wisconsin high school in which a transgender student exposed male genitalia to four female students. Outrage ensued in a Wisconsin school district after an 18-year-old male-to-female transgender student allegedly got into the showers with four freshman girls and exposed their male genitalia to them at an area high school. In a statement, an attorney representing the district admitted the incident should have never happened, but one legal group says the overall response to concerns raised by parents has been lackluster at best. ""The most basic duty of a school district is to keep our kids safe while they learn,"" Dan Lennington, Deputy Counsel at the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), told Fox News' Pete Hegseth on Sunday. TRANS WOMAN SHOWERED WITH FOUR WISCONSIN HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS, VIOLATED THEIR PRIVACY, LETTER TO DISTRICT CLAIMS""These four girls just wanted to rinse off after gym class involving a swim unit and, when they went into the shower, they were confronted by an 18-year-old who undressed, said ‘I’m trans by the way,' and exposed his penis to these four freshman girls."" Sun Prairie High School in Wisconsin. (Fox & Friends Weekend/Screengrab/Google Maps) A letter sent by WILL claimed the trans student ""undressed fully and showered completely naked right next to one of the girls,"" initially with their back turned to the girls, but then faced them, fully exposing male genitals. The incident was reported to student services, but WILL complained that the incident should have been reported to a Title IX coordinator so that the girls could receive the support they needed and be afforded a space to file a complaint. ""Supportive measures might have included accommodations to maintain their access to education and adequate privacy in the locker room, at least while a Title IX investigation was pending. No one from the District contacted any of the girls’ parents at that time, and no one investigated. To be clear, that means that the District’s initial response to this incident violated Title IX,"" the letter continued. WISCONSIN PARENTS OUTRAGED AFTER TEACHHER GIVES TRANSGENDER LESSON TO K-5TH GRADE WITHOUT PERMISSION A transgender flag unfurled on a pole.  (Getty) ""These teachers and administrators did not even investigate this matter the next week and, when the parents finally started to email about this and call about this, the school district couldn't even identify the policy. Nobody could tell the parents – what is the rule? What is the policy?"" Lennington said of the alleged Tilte IX violation, calling the response ""totally inadequate."" Lennington claimed the school district waited a month to sit down with parents to hear their concerns, calling the delay – and the lack of concrete policy on related issues – concerning for schools nationwide. ""This could be going on in schools all across the country,"" he warned. WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT RULES THAT A TRANSGENDER WOMAN CANNOT CHANGE HER NAME BECAUSE SHE IS A SEX OFFENDER Sun Prairie Area School District faced backlash after a transgender student allegedly exposed male genitalia to four freshman girls while showering with them after gym class. (Fox News) Fox News reached out to the superintendent's office for comment and received the following statement from an attorney representing the school district: ""The Sun Prairie Area School District does not condone any student of one sex being present in a state of undress in the presence of students of another sex… The simple truth is that this incident should not have happened, but it did, and the District addressed it long before the recent publicity. School districts across the country are striving to protect and support all students."" ""Districts must balance the dual goals of supporting transitioning students while also protecting the privacy interests of all students."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""They say ‘sex’ and we're not sure what they mean by ‘sex,’"" Lennington responded. ""They don't have a written policy… the question is: Should someone with a penis be in a girls’ locker room or in the shower? And that's the question that they're unable to answer because they won't answer ‘what is a boy? What is a male? What is a female?’"" He elaborated, arguing that girls and young women are the victims of the Biden administration's attempt to ""water down"" Title IX by expanding the measure to include ""gender identity.""

Chicago's Lori Lightfoot slammed over crime pivot following ousting: 'Too little too late',"Retired Chicago police lieutenant John Garrido joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss Lightfoot's pivot on crime and broader concerns surrounding the surge in violence. Chicago's outgoing mayor Lori Lightfoot appeared to make a pivot on her ultra-progressive stance on violence, urging Democrats to ""speak the truth"" on surging crime across the country. But critics say her shift was ""too little, too late,"" as her successor, Mayor-elect Brandon Johnson, is set to be sworn into office next month. Retired Chicago police lieutenant John Garrido accused Lightfoot of refusing to take accountability for the Windy City's surging crime under her leadership during ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" ""Too little, too late,"" Garrido told co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy on Sunday. ""If you listen to her entire speech there, she doesn't take any accountability whatsoever.

I'm not sure exactly what she's looking for, but she definitely always likes to point the finger at everybody else,"" he continued. ""It's always somebody else's fault. Even when she lost the election, it was somebody else's fault, not her own, but she created the toxic work environment that we have now that's causing thousands of officers to leave every year."" While speaking on a panel at the African American Mayors Association Conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Lightfoot called on Democratic mayors to address the growing crime in their cities. ""As Democrats, if we do not speak the truth about violent crime in our cities, we will be the worse for it,"" Lightfoot said. ""I come to this conversation as a former federal prosecutor. I come to this as a former defense attorney, I am the sister of a returning resident,"" Lightfoot continued. ""But I know that there are people in my city that are wreaking havoc every day and need to be off the streets. That’s reality."" CHICAGO MAYOR-ELECT CONDEMNS ‘TEEN TAKEOVER’ CHAOS, BUT SAYS IT’S ‘NOT CONSTRUCTIVE TO DEMONIZE YOUTH’ Ironically, many critics cite the surge in violence under her leadership as a key reason for her ousting. According to data from the Chicago Police Department, motor vehicle theft has spiked 168%, murders have soared 82%, aggravated battery is up 36%, and theft is up 29% this week in 2023 in comparison to the same week last year. Meanwhile, the process is underway for the city to select a new superintendent for the police department after Lightfoot's pick, David Brown, stepped down back in March. Since Brown's resignation, Interim Superintendent Eric Carter also announced he would be resigning ahead of Johnson's swearing in. While the process will supposedly include more public opinion, Garrido noted the decision is still ultimately up to the mayor. ""This is the first time that we've had this type of commission put together,"" Garrido said. ""It'll be interesting to see how they come together to come up with somebody. They're actually going to have town hall meetings and try to include public opinion."" ""At the end of the day, though, the mayor still gets to make their decision if they want to take those selections or not,"" he continued. ""Back when Rahm Emanuel was in, the police board actually made the recommendations, and he discarded it, made them go back to the drawing board until they picked the one that he wanted.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Johnson narrowly won against his moderate opponent, Democrat Paul Vallas, earlier this month in a runoff election.

Ex-Marine calls for action after GOP rep grills VA official on 'faith-based' PTSD partnerships,"'Save Our Allies' co-founder and U.S. Marine veteran Chad Robichaux reacts to NSC Coordinator John Kirby's play down of the 'chaos' in the Afghanistan withdrawal and the Biden administration blaming Donald Trump. A retired Recon Marine with eight Afghanistan deployments who also battled PTSD called for the Biden administration to actively partner with faith-based veterans' mental health programs and organizations, after a Veterans Affairs official was pressed on the issue during a hearing. Chad Robichaux, founder of the Mighty Oaks Foundation – which provides faith-based programs to combat psychological and emotional challenges of veterans returning home –  told Fox News Digital he was outraged by the answers he heard in the House VA Subcommittee on Health hearing this week. During the hearing, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis. – a retired Navy SEAL himself -- invoked Robichaux's foundation while questioning Dr. Tamara Campbell, executive director of the Veterans Health Administration's Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. Van Orden asked Campbell whether her office is ""preventing veterans from committing suicide or not."" WHITE HOUSE, KIRBY FACE BACKLASH FROM MILITARY VETERANS OVER DEFENSE OF AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL REPORT Chad Robichaux appears on ""Fox News @ Night"" (Fox News) ""Or are we just spending money and hiring people so that they can get together, come to these committee meetings, talk a bunch, submit reports, with metrics that can't be defined?"" he asked. Campbell said her department is ""moving the needle on this"" and must have a ""full public health approach where suicide prevention is concerned."" Van Orden further asked how many ""faith-based non-evidence programs"" the VA is currently administering to veterans seeking their help and what her office's ""metrics for success"" are. ""Within VA, we certainly value scientifically-based-evidence-based programs. That does not mean, however, that we don't collaborate with our chaplain services…"" Campbell replied. Van Orden said Campbell's response suggested the department is not actively working with ""wildly successful"" programs ""because they are faith-based – which according to you guys are 'non-evidence-based'."" ""Living veterans: That's evidence of a program's functioning,"" Van Orden said, going on to reference Robichaux's organization. Campbell added the department would, however, be willing to meet with Mighty Oaks to discuss a potential partnership. In response, Robichaux told Fox News he was thankful for Van Orden's questioning, saying he hopes the VA will keep its word and reach out to his group.

(Scott Varley/MediaNews Group/Torrance Daily Breeze via Getty) Robichaux, who also co-founded the Save Our Allies organization that was instrumental in rescuing Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall from Ukraine, claimed the VA ""cherry-picked data"" in its report and wrongly excluded overdoses, at least at the present time. ""The American taxpayer is funding a one-solution system for the mental health and suicide epidemic for our warriors, and it is a pharmaceutical one. And it is failing,"" Robichaux said. He criticized U.S. aid to Afghanistan that he suggested is simply landing in the hands of the Taliban. ""Meanwhile we are giving … $113 billion to corruption in Ukraine, [without] congressional oversight. With just one of those billion [dollars], faith-based VSOs could nearly eradicate this crisis amongst our military community,"" Robichaux argued. Robichaux told Fox News the Obama administration previously removed funding for faith-and community-based programs through a 2009 executive order, while adding he formally asked then-candidate Donald Trump in 2015 to overturn the order. ""The truth is PTSD, and trauma are typically spiritual wounds to the human soul, and a spiritual wound requires a spiritual solution found through a relationship with God,"" he said. ""We cannot take this away from our warriors and expect them to heal…"" REPUBLICAN DERRICK VAN ORDEN FLIPS WISCONSIN HOUSE SEAT RED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty) Trump reportedly agreed to Robichaux's request, and weeks before his administration ended, the VA proposed a rule removing regulatory barriers ushering in ""equal treatment"" between religious and non-religious organizations in VA-supported social service programs. Robichaux told Fox News he will continue to work with organizations inside and outside of government that are ""willing do our part to end this horrific epidemic among our nations heroes."" Robichaux argued Mighty Oaks' has thousands of success stories and ""third-party independent data"" showed it to be an ""evidence-based"" program despite the use of the moniker during Campbell's hearing. In response to the hearing's testimony, Van Orden told Fox News as a retired SEAL who has lost friends to suicide, he feels the VA must take an ""all of the above approach to help prevent this scourge."" ""I am sick and tired of this bureaucracy refusing to acknowledge that what they call ‘non-evidence based’ treatment programs have actually shown solid evidence of saving the lives of my fellow veterans, particularly faith-based programs,"" he said. Van Orden added the VA's Office of Mental Health & Suicide Prevention has been in existence for three decades, positing he would have ""no idea, if they closed tomorrow, if a single veteran’s life would be saved."" In response to some of the criticism, the VA said in a lengthy statement to Fox News Digital that the department stops ""at nothing to get Veterans who live with substance use disorder the help they need and deserve."" ""VA offers a comprehensive continuum of specialty substance use disorder (SUD) services for Veterans, not just medication-based treatment. This continuum of care includes specialty SUD treatment outpatient and residential programs."" In response to the concern regarding whether overdose-suicide deaths were included in the report at hand, the department said its National Suicide Prevention Annual Report includes overdoses deemed to be suicides. ""The purpose of the report is to count every veteran suicide so we can prevent every veteran suicide. Ending veteran suicide and saving lives is our top clinical priority at VA, and we take every step possible to make sure that our veteran suicide data is accurate—because the first step to solving this problem is understanding it,"" the department said. ""In the interest of full transparency, we release yearly reports detailing how we come to the conclusions in the Annual Suicide Prevention Report."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In response to criticism of the perception it weighs pharmaceutical-based resources over others, the VA also said its work has positioned it to ""respond to emerging drug use trends"" and that the substance abuse epidemic is a paramount concern for its patents and veterans writ-large. Outside of pharmacological assistance, the VA told Fox News it recently hired ""peer specialists"" to work with veterans suffering from addiction with the goal of increasing engagement and retention of an array of treatment options. The department's latest budget allocated for expanded residential program access, additional homeless veteran case managers and expanded access to employment support for veterans-in-treatment or recovery, the VA told Fox News Digital. Regarding the state of the 2020 faith-based organizations ""equal treatment"" rule proposed under the Trump administration, the VA pointed Fox News Digital to a January 2023 proposal by the Biden-Harris VA ""restoring protections for beneficiaries of federally funded social services."" According to the release, nine agencies, including Veterans Affairs, are party to a proposal to ""further advance President Biden's call for religious freedom and equity,"" which included a stipulation to ""continue to notify such [faith-based providers of federally-funded social services] they are equally eligible to compete with other organizations"" for grants.

We just had a breakdown and that was a way to break it. So I always thank Governor DeSantis for that moment."" Gov. Ron DeSantis  (James Gilbert/Getty Images) Coming from a family of immigrants, Masvidal said he ""learned many lessons"" by escaping communism and coming to America. ""My dad, his best friend and his best friend's uncle, they got two tire tractors, turned them into a raft and hit the seas. Seven days later, they got to the Bahamas. From there, he got extradited to the USA and began his journey."" UFC'S DANA WHITE: WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ‘WOKE’ OVER HERE He added, ""as I got older, you know, like close to my teens, like 11, 12 years old, I really understood why my dad did this. And it was escape the tyranny that that is communism over there in Cuba, in places like Venezuela, where we see this happening in Brazil.

Donald Trump dishes on past friendship with Bill Clinton,"Former President Donald Trump sits down with Mark Levin for a wide-ranging interview on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' Former President Donald Trump might currently be the Clintons' most high-profile political foil, but that wasn't always the case, he told Fox News. Trump told ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" he used to have a cordial relationship with the 42nd president and his wife, so much so as to frequently exchange letters with Clinton. ""They came to my wedding,"" Trump quipped, as Bill and Hillary were guests of his 2005 wedding to the former Melania Knauss. Other guests included left-wing pundit Chris Matthews and a slew of famous New Yorkers including Billy Joel, Tony Bennett, former Republican Gov. George Pataki and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Trump recalled playing rounds of golf with Bill Clinton, and later retiring to the clubhouse where the 42nd president would spend as many as two-and-a-half hours waxing about politics. ""This is before I even thought in terms of politics for myself,"" he said. In that regard, Trump said Bill Clinton's retail politician persona and political acumen presented a major missed opportunity for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential loss post-mortem. ""I think they did a great disservice by not using him when I went against Hillary. I think that they had this unbelievable weapon known as Bill Clinton, who was a natural politician,"" he said.

Joy Reid compares Supreme Court’s Samuel Alito to extremist ‘mullahs’ for abortion drug ruling dissent,"MSNBC host Joy Reid smeared U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday night for his dissent in the Court’s decision to allow the FDA to keep abortion drug mifepristone accessible to Americans. MSNBC host Joy Reid slammed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday night for his dissent in the court’s decision to allow the FDA to keep abortion drug mifepristone accessible to Americans. During the Friday episode of her MSNBC show, ""The ReidOut,"" Reid claimed that Alito was playing ""mullah"" in his dissent on Friday, likening him to an Islamic religious zealot.

She said, ""Lisa, this reads to me like him admitting, ‘We don’t have an army, we don’t have the ability to enforce our decisions, and we’re not sure the government would even obey.’"" She chuckled, adding, ""That’s a pretty glaring admission of weakness and a pretty churlish thing to write down in your dissent.

NY Times reveals Biden has held fewest press conferences since Reagan: ‘Strategy to protect from criticism,"House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., says the federal government has known ‘for a long time’ that Hunter Biden was very involved in ‘shady’ business meetings with ‘adversaries’ around the world. As reported by New York Times White House correspondent Michael Shear, President Joe Biden has held the ""fewest"" press conferences since Ronald Reagan was in office. In a piece for the outlet, Shear called out the Biden administration for being one of the least accessible presidents to the press in 100 years, despite his administration pledging he would have one the most transparent presidencies. The reporter surmised that Biden’s few interactions with the media is evidence that ""his political strategists want to protect him from the unscripted exchanges that have often resulted in missteps and criticism.""

President Biden is spending the weekend in Wilmington, Delaware.  ((Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)) Shear’s piece began with the numbers on just how rare it is for Biden to offer unscripted answers to the press, stating, ""In the 100 years since Calvin Coolidge took office, only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan held as few news conferences each year as the current occupant of the Oval Office."" The report touched on how, during Biden’s recent trip to Ireland, he ""abandoned the decades-old tradition of holding a news conference while abroad."" And when he met with Colombian President Gustavo Petro this week, ""the two did not hold a news conference together, another practice of his predecessors that Mr. Biden has frequently chosen to skip,"" Shear observed. The report noted the hypocrisy of Biden’s actions, considering his staff’s campaign promises. Shear wrote, ""And despite his press secretary pledging that Mr. Biden would ‘bring transparency and truth back to the government,’ in his first two years, the president granted the fewest interviews since Mr. Reagan’s presidency: only 54."" In that same span of time during their respective presidencies, ""Donald J. Trump gave 202,"" while ""Barack Obama gave 275,"" Shear wrote. He added, ""More than any president in recent memory, Mr. Biden, 80, has taken steps to reduce opportunities for journalists to question him in forums where he can offer unscripted answers and they can follow up. The result, critics say, is a president who has fewer moments of public accountability for his comments, decisions and actions.""

It said, ""The president’s strategy of keeping the press at arm’s length is a bet that he can sidestep those traditions in a new media environment. And it is public evidence that Mr. Biden’s political strategists want to protect him from the unscripted exchanges that have often resulted in missteps and criticism."" Of course, the Biden team claims this strategy is about reaching ""the American people wherever and however they consume media, and that’s not just through the briefing room or Washington-based news outlets,"" White House comms director Ben LaBolt said. He added, ""the fracturing of the media and the changing nature of information consumption requires a communications strategy that adapts to reach Americans where they get the news."" LaBolt maintained that Biden has ""held nearly 400 question-and-answer sessions with reporters since he took office,"" noting that is more than Trump, Obama, or former President George W. Bush did. However, Shear clarified in his write-up, ""But those interactions between Mr. Biden and reporters are usually very brief, with shouted questions that the president often chooses not to answer. When he does, it is sometimes with a clipped, one- or two-word response.""

College students open up about artificial intelligence in the classroom: 'Everyone is using ChatGPT',"College students Tabatha Fajardo, Jay Ram and Kyra Varnavas give their take on the development of AI in the classroom on 'The Story.' College students impacted by the increased presence of artifical intelligence on their campuses gave ""The Story"" their take on how the technology will affect them in the classroom and the job market. AI has the ability to mimic human consciousness and complete tasks like writing essays, driving a family across the country or making decisions in a chess game, according to a previous Fox News Digital report. ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, is gaining popularity among young people who can type in a writing prompt and receive an essay back in minutes. ""If you go into a library right now, you can see sort of everyone is using ChatGPT,"" college junior Jay Ram told host Martha MacCallum on Thursday. ""I think there are people who are using it for bad that are using it to write the essay for them, and there are people who are using it sort of like Google as, like, a research tool."" While complex AI programming can aid students in showing them steps to complete a math problem or giving them ideas for their research projects, some Americans have voiced concerns about the impact programming has on learning. WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF AI? Campus Reform correspondent Tabatha Fajardo, who attends Stony Brook University, explained that while many Americans fear AI will be used to replace humans, the man-made programming cannot take away from authentic human connection. ""You can insert something into a program and they'll create a haiku for you, but it will never take away from the human connection,"" she said. Fajardo also noted a report finding that many students view AI technology's use as a form of cheating. ""A recent report by Leadership Institute's Campus Reform reported on a survey about intelligence that states that about a third of its college-age students who had responded said that they had admitted to using ChatGPT and AI like it and so, not only have they used it, but there's a large majority of students who say that it's also considered a form of cheating,"" Fajardo said. ""In order to prepare to enter the job market, we need to be doing the work honestly and so it brings up the question about academic integrity."" Many college students wonder what impact the new programming will have on the job market. ""In the financial industry, there are so many different applications of AI that can be seen within finance and especially, for example, for roles that may be more trading-intensive as far as trading securities,"" said Kyra Varnavas, a finance major at Fordham University.

WARNS AGAINST 'SYSTEM OF SOCIALISM FOR THE RICH' AS 2024 CAMPAIGN LAUNCHES ""Right now, polls show President Biden losing to Donald Trump, who is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party"" Kennedy argued, Saturday. ""Ultimately, I think I'm in a much better position to beat Donald Trump than Joe Biden is. And I also just disagree with him on basic issues, like my father did with Lyndon Johnson on censorship. I don't think the White House should be censoring its political critics."" ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. LAUNCHES DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGE AGAINST BIDEN, VOWS TO FIGHT 'CORPORATE FEUDALISM' The Democratic challenger continued, touting that if Americans have an ""appetite"" for truth, he will be in the ""White House in 2025."" ""Like My dad ran on principle, he did not believe that he could win. And his objective was to tell the truth to the American people, and that's what I'm going to do. And if there's an appetite for that, I'll be in the White House in 2025,"" he said. Some critics say that voters are looking for a fresh candidate in 2024, taking into account the physical risks associated with an older nominee. Kennedy Jr. weighed in, arguing that there are ""things that [he's] much more frightened of."" ""I'm clearly aware of that risk, but there are things that I'm much more frightened of than, you know, than death, for example. I'm much more frightened of losing my constitutional rights and of America losing its democracy,"" Kennedy Jr. continued. ""I don't think age is the major metric. I think the metric is your physical health and your mental acuity. So, I mean, there are people who are 80 years old, who I meet who seem almost younger than me. So I don't think the actual chronological age is the limiting factor. I think the more important issue is, is just the mental acuity,"" he said. Kennedy is considered a long shot in the presidential race, but a new poll says he has taken a chunk of President Biden's supporters in the outset of his campaign. A new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll says 14 percent of Biden’s 2020 voters flocked to Kennedy when he first announced his candidacy earlier this month.

NY Post scorches ‘fake’ intel letter used to sink laptop story: ‘Actual disinfo operation’ helped Biden,"Rep. James Comer: Hunter Biden whistleblowers are starting to cooperate. The New York Post editorial board reacted forcefully to the news that then-Biden campaign staff allegedly helped cook up the 2020 letter signed by 51 intelligence ""experts"" which denounced the paper’s Hunter Biden laptop story as a Russian hoax. The editorial provided a searing condemnation of the entire operation to stymie the paper’s reporting and save the 2020 election for Biden, involving the intel community, the Biden campaign, news outlets, and social media platforms. Testimony from former acting CIA Director Mike Morell this week alleged that then-Biden campaign advisor Antony Blinken ""played a role in the inception"" of the public statement signed by former and current U.S. intelligence experts claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. WHITE HOUSE INSISTS NO 'POLITICAL INTERFERENCE' IN HUNTER BIDEN PROBE AFTER IRS WHISTLEBLOWER COMES FORWARD The New York Times and The Washington Post both eventually verified Hunter Bidens laptop after big tech dismissed the New York Posts bombshell reporting during the 2020 presidential election. (Getty images  |  New York Post) According to Morrell, Blinken approached him and the other experts and asked them to sign the letter, which the former director did because he wanted to ""help Vice President Biden … because I wanted him to win the election."" After the letter was crafted, the media and Biden team trotted it out to discredit reporting on the Biden family’s corruption found on the computer, reporting that was led by The New York Post’s bombshell story revealing the existence of the laptop and its contents. The Post took a rhetorical sledgehammer to the Biden-aided plot to discredit their bombshell story, opening its editorial with the statement, ""The dishonor of our intelligence community, and most of the media, is now complete."" It added, ""It turns out the ‘51 intel experts’ letter implying Hunter Biden’s 100% authentic laptop was a Russian fake, and the ensuing efforts to kill Post reporting on it, were the actual disinfo operation."" The Post first targeted Morell, calling him a ""Veteran spook"" and painting him as the person who ""masterminded"" the disinfo operation. It then mentioned his obvious political bias in doing so, writing ""And Morell plainly also did it in hopes a victorious Biden would hand him the top CIA job."" The outlet, whose piece on the laptop was also censored on Twitter and other social media platforms based on the word of these intel experts, declared, ""Not only was there no intricate Russian plot, there was never any evidence suggesting one — only a Biden campaign conspiracy to bury the truth under a tissue of lies.""

The New York Post bashed the media for promoting this ""Russian fake,"" saying,""But a compliant media really made this possible,"" the outlet claimed, adding, ""The ‘experts’ handed the letter to Natasha Bertrand, then at Politico (now at CNN), an eager propagator of such disinformation."" It detailed how Politico ""promptly packaged the letter’s ‘bears the hallmarks of Russian disinformation’ language into a headline claiming the experts deemed it to be disinfo,"" which it said prompted ""an avalanche of similar reporting and a media-wide refusal to touch the story (except to attack The Post for reporting it)."" The Post even reminded readers how Politico’s ""bogus headline implying the laptop was fake"" is still unchanged on the outlet’s website. It then turned to social media companies that ""(primed by false warnings from secret government censors) blocked and downgraded posts sharing The Post’s reporting."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The board blasted all of these parties for working in tandem over this letter to get Biden elected, a disinfo operation similar to when ""media fell for a Hillary Clinton campaign op, RussiaGate,"" it noted.

CDC linked to pervasive curriculum sweeping public schools nationwide,"Dukes and Jackson, both with No Left Turn in Education, said parents should be concerned about how AI is being used in schools, and what information it may gather on students. Educators at over 120 districts across the country are implementing a pervasive school curriculum that has been denounced by opponents as an effort to manipulate children's values and beliefs and replace parents as the primary moral authority in their child's lives, with many critics specifically pointing to similarities with programs from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a major point of contention. The School Superintendent's Association (AASA), with the help of superintendents, board members and school administrators, is implementing the Learning 2025 program, which calls for an equity-focused, ""holistic redesign"" of the United States' public education system by 2025, in districts across the country The parents' advocacy group, No Left Turn in Education (NLTE), is sounding the alarm about the curriculum's alleged ties to the CDC, especially since Learning 2025 outlines its plans as a solution to the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning 2025 frequently references the idea of a ""Whole Child"" educational framework to promote the notion that school districts should focus on a collective, whole community vision that is strikingly similar to the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) educational framework devised by the CDC. Both programs place a strong emphasis on students’ and teachers’ social and emotional health, including employee wellness programs, as well as psychological and social services like school-based health and counseling centers. PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICT CONSIDERS BRINGING ‘FEELINGS' INTO MATH CURRICULUM AS SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS BALK NLTE Chief Operating Officer Melissa Jackson said Learning 2025 is just a new way to make money on the same CDC product because ""the components are still the same"" with the emphasis on utilizing the community to influence and curate the ""Whole Child"" and their personal ideals beyond reading, writing and arithmetic. Mixed race kids at home using smart tablets to play games. (iStock) The CDC's ""Whole Child"" approach places its focus on psychological counseling and social services for students and teachers to further the ""collaboration between education leaders and health sectors to improve each child’s cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development,"" which is often referred to as social emotional learning (SEL). SEL is advertised as a way to teach students social skills in support of their mental health and emotional wellbeing, but it has been criticized as a way to implement controversial topics like Critical Race Theory and Gender Theory. As a result, it has become a point of contention among parents, teachers and politicians who advocate for a strong academic emphasis at school and against classroom discussions that they feel should be left up to parents' discretion at home. NLTE refers to SEL as ""socially engineered learning"" because instead of placing the emphasis on reading, writing and arithmetic, they argue it moves the focus away from academics to center on higher cognitive skills, like self-awareness, empathy and control of emotions. EXCLUSIVE: LIBERAL FOUNDATIONS FUNNEL MILLIONS TO RED STATES FOR WOKE SCHOOL PROGRAMS; PARENTS DEMAND CHANGE When reached for comment, the CDC told Fox News Digital that Learning 2025 ""is not a CDC program,"" but a document about the program indicates a connection between the CDC and AASA. ""AASA is using the new model with our superintendent cadre,"" a document about the CDC's Whole Child program states. ""We’ve updated all of our coordinated school health training materials to include the new model as the model for coordinated school health"" and ""We’ve created a booster session and updated training materials to reflect the WSCC [CDC] model."" The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been criticized and mocked from all sides after a series of muddled messages have baffled Americans amid a record surge in COVID-19 cases and the spread of the omicron variant.

""Learning 2025 is [billed as] the answer to what has happened to the children,"" but ""the root of the problem is not the COVID shutdown … goes back to the attack on culture,"" Dukes said. ""I have a problem accepting a program from the very same people that caused the problem,"" she added. ""That's what I want parents to know, is that these organizations were part of it, and now they're offering you a solution to the problem."" BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR ‘WOKE’ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CALLED ‘SOCIAL CANCER’ Holly Terei serves as NLTE's National Director of Teacher Coalition and attended a Learning 2025 conference last summer, where she observed the curriculum's framework in action. She said she also noticed the similarities between Learning 2025 and the CDC model. ""If you put Learning 2025 and the CDC Whole Child model side by side, it is exactly the same,"" Terei said. ""They tweak some of the wording like whole learner and whole child."" ""It's kind of like, let's put lipstick on a pig and call it a lady,"" she added. ""With Learning 2025, we can kind of gloss over it with a lot of this fluffy, flowery language and kind of mask the true intentions behind it."" A child puts her mask back on after finishing lunch at a socially distanced table in the cafeteria of Medora Elementary School on March 17, 2021 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Jon Cherry/Getty Images) Dukes said parents should be concerned about the CDC dictating policy because it is not a governing body. They make recommendations, but because the CDC is heavily influenced by donors, she described their work as a complete overreach of power and a problematic partnership of public and private entities influencing policy in an effort to exclude parents from the conversation. At the Learning 2025 conference last summer, Terei said she felt there was a common notion that educators, not parents, know what is best for their children. She said strategies were promoted to teach superintendents how to ""shush us and push us [parents] out of the picture, so they can do what they feel is best for our children."" A Learning 2025 report obtained by NLTE and reviewed by Fox News Digital encourages communities to work with local governments, so schools can ""transform into indispensable resources"" for ""the community at large."" ""Instead of your child being looked at as an extension of you or belonging to you, they are looked at as an extension of the government and of the government schools,"" Terei said. ""This is a total overreach through these public and private partnerships, and it is incredibly concerning,"" she added. ""We're opening a Pandora's box, I believe, through these initiatives."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In another section of the report, the curriculum envisions schools as becoming ""hubs of supports and resources to the greater community"" which will mean ""reimagining roles, responsibilities, relationships, and partnerships focused on building assets in children, families, schools, and community."" ""Through what I've learned at the conference, there's an intentionality of bypassing parental rights by not being transparent about the implementation of the program, the data collection that goes into it, the fact that it's not a proven educational program and that our children, who have been signed up as demo districts with Learning 2025, are literally a part of a social educational experiment,"" Terei said.

SCOTUS Christian postal worker case will change standard on accommodating religious Americans: Legal counsel,"Randall Wenger, chief counsel for the Independence Law Center representing a Christian postal worker who was denied Sundays off to observe the Sabbath, explains the case on 'The Story.' Legal counsel representing a Christian postal worker who was reportedly disciplined for refusing to work on Sundays says it is clear the Supreme Court is ""going to change the standard"" to accommodate religious Americans in the workplace. Gerald Groff, an evangelical Christian mail carrier from Pennsylvania, resigned believing he would be fired from the U.S. Postal Service after he said he could not deliver Amazon packages on Sundays because he observes the Sabbath. Groff’s attorney Aaron Streett is arguing the Supreme Court should overturn precedent that employers can deny religious accommodations to employees if they impose ""more than a de minimis cost"" on the business, according to a previous Fox News report. ""We understand that we need to give accommodations to employees in all kinds of different areas,"" Randall Wenger, chief counsel for the Independence Law Center, told ""America Reports"" on Tuesday. ""Think of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We were supposed to reasonably accommodate unless it is an undue hardship and the same thing under religion."" ""We're supposed to reasonably accommodate unless there's an undue hardship, but the standard that we use, what we call undue hardship under the ADA, is very different than what we call undue hardship under religion and why would we give less protection for religion than we do for the ADA?

"Trump campaign cites progressive groups, Joy Reid's blog in attacks on Ron DeSantis","Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has more on former President Trump racking up endorsements on Gov. DeSantis' home turf and the growing GOP 2024 field on 'Your World.' Former President Donald Trump's campaign on Friday launched multiple attacks on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential rival in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, citing multiple progressive groups and far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid's blog in doing so. In a press release titled, ""The Real Ron DeSantis Playbook,"" Trump's campaign cited data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) and the Florida Policy Institute to blast DeSantis for what it said was data showing the state continuing ""to tumble into complete and total delinquency and destruction."" Additionally, Trump later posted on Truth Social with a quote from Reid's Wednesday blog, The ReidOut, which called DeSantis' trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with lawmakers this week a ""charm offensive,"" and ""a massive failure.""

"There have been 1,080 attempts to punish scholars over the past 23 years: Report","A former law professor said university officials need to enforce their own policies after students and educators heckled a judge and stopped his remarks. A free-speech group found that there have been over 1000 attempts to punish scholars over the past 23 years.

Jonathan Turley: Biden campaign got the media to buy into the Hunter laptop 'illusion',"Constitutional law professor and attorney Jonathan Turley on how the intelligence community worked with the Biden campaign to bury the Hunter Biden laptop story before the 2020 election. Constitutional lawyer Jonathan Turley slammed the media for its coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal in the weeks before the 2020 presidential election. Turley contended that the media uncritically accepted the Biden campaign's talking point that the laptop was Russian disinformation. ""The media immediately said, we're not going to report on this. Even before the letter came out, they were resisting it,"" Turley said on Fox New's ""Brian Kilmeade Show"". ""Yet when they get this unsupported letter, they just immediately replicate it. They don't ask. They don't press on where it came from, who was behind it,"" he continued.

""This represents an increase from the prior six months, from January to June 2022, in which 1,149 instances of book banning were recorded. Over 4,000 instances of banned books have been recorded since PEN America started tracking book bans in July 2021, affecting 2,253 unique titles. Overall, the bans impact 182 school districts in 37 states and millions of students.""

They also note that 26% of unique titles banned have LGBTQ+ characters or themes. PEN American claimed that they have tracked book-banning efforts for the past two years by documenting the growth of groups advocating for book bans, the widespread challenges to books across the nation, efforts on the local level such as school district policies and procedures, and the state-level policies. The book ban issue has been prevalent in red states such as Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah, and South Carolina where local school boards took up the issue. For instance, the Hillsborough County, Florida school board recently decided to ban ""This Book Is Gay"" from middle school libraries on March 28.

As the book was labeled ""pornographic,"" the Hillsborough County school board meeting reportedly spiraled into a heated debate about the graphic book. Dawson even told Rolling Stone Magazine a few weeks ago that the book was ""definitely not pornographic"" and also noted that the book is ""not for children."" The book bans during the 2022-23 school year came amid lawmakers across the United States implementing rigorous book review policies and other education reform legislation that addresses progressive curricula like critical race theory and gender theory being taught in classrooms.

""[The bill] will remind students all across Texas of the importance of the fundamental foundation of America,"" King said during the hearing, according to the Texas Tribune. If the bill passed in the Texas Senate, it would be sent to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to be signed into law.  ((Photo by Jana Birchum/Getty Images)) He also said the U.S. Supreme Court signaled the bill was constitutional after it ruled in favor of Joe Kennedy, a high school football coach in Washington state who was fired for praying before games. WEST VIRGINIA ADVANCES PUBLIC SCHOOL MANDATE ON ‘IN GOD WE TRUST’ The proposal comes on the heels of the passage of a law in August that requires schools to display ""In God We Trust"" signs in a ""conspicuous place"" as long as are ""donated"" or ""purchased by private donations"" ""The national motto, In God We Trust, asserts our collective trust in a sovereign God,"" Texas Republican State Sen. Bryan Hughes, who sponsored the legislation, wrote on Twitter. ""I co-authored the bill in 2003 that allowed schools to display the motto, and last year I authored the ‘In God We Trust Act,’ which requires a school to display the motto if there is no cost associated with the display."" The Senate also gave final passage to Senate Bill 1396, which would allow public and charter schools to adopt a policy that would set aside time for students and employees to pray and read religious texts like the Bible at school. CHURCH LEADERS MOSTLY SILENT AFTER TEEN WHO OPPOSED TRANSGENDER SUSPENDED FROM CATHOLIC SCHOOL Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, R., applauded both pieces of legislation as wins for religious liberty in the state. ""Allowing the Ten Commandments and prayer back into our public schools is one step we can take to make sure that all Texans have the right to freely express their sincerely held religious beliefs,"" he said in a statement. The Supreme Court heard two cases on whether Ten Commandments monuments should be displayed on government properties in 2005.  ((Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)) ""I believe that you cannot change the culture of the country until you change the culture of mankind,"" he added. ""Bringing the Ten Commandments and prayer back to our public schools will enable our students to become better Texans."" The Senate also passed Bill 1556, which would codify the Supreme Court’s ruling on the high school football coach into law and protect the right of school employees to engage in religious speech or prayer ""while on duty.""

Journalist Matt Taibbi fires back at Democrats after threatening letter: 'Have they all gone mad?',"'Twitter Files' journalist Matt Taibbi and MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan clashed over Taibbi's reporting in a contentious interview. Matt Taibbi fired back at a Democrat who sent him a letter suggesting he could face prison time after his contentious congressional testimony last month, saying the party as a whole had lost its mind. ""At the moment I still can’t quite wrap my head around this, and hope others will be able to make more sense of it. I’d laugh, but I have three kids, and these people might be serious. It’s like waking up in a H.U.A.C. hearing. Have they all gone mad?"" he asked. Taibbi, one of several journalists behind the ""Twitter Files,"" received a letter from Democratic Rep. Stacey Plaskett, suggesting he could be sent to prison for perjury based on remarks he made last month before a House subcommittee about government weaponization. ""I learned yesterday Virgin Islands Delegate and Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government Stacey Plaskett is threatening me with prison, over her own error,"" he wrote in a piece headlined, ""House Democrats Have Lost Their Minds.""

Journalist Matt Taibbi refused to reveal a source during a heated House Judiciary Committee hearing on Twitter Files.  (Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage) ""It would be one thing if I really made the mistake. In that case, Plaskett’s letter would merely be an outrageous attempt to intimidate a witness by threatening a charge of intentional lying over a miscue. But that’s not the case,"" Taibbi wrote. ""I did of course make an error, but what Plaskett is referencing is actually a mistake by Hasan, one she’s now repeating. I’m not sure what to do but explain and show this as clearly as possible."" He added further detail about how two major institutions with similar acronyms could be so easily mixed up, due partly to how closely they work together. ""I did in a tweet conflate the Center for American Security (CIS) with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), saying that CISA was so close to Stanford’s Election Integrity Project (EIP) that Twitter staffers didn’t really distinguish between them,"" he wrote. ""This happened precisely because the agencies were hand-in-glove partners, and I’d seen so many communications about their cooperation that I lost track of some acronyms. I even tweeted months before, in TwitterFiles #6, that the agencies CIS and CISA were easily confused, because both worked with the EIP and CIS was a DHS contractor."" Rep. Stacey Plaskett (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) JOURNALIST MATT TAIBBI THREATENED WITH PRISON TIME FOR PERJURY BY TOP DEMOCRAT OVER TWITER FILES TESTIMONY After writing further details about ties between the CIS and CISA, Taibbi went on to lament how this latest controversy says more about the state of the American government than it does about his integrity as a journalist. ""This means that when Plaskett writes it was ‘misinformation’ for me to be ‘alleging that CISA — a government entity — was working with the EIP to have posts removed from social media,’ she herself is engaging in misinformation. It may be an unintentional mistake, as she certainly seems capable of not knowing or caring to know underlying reality, but it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding,"" he wrote. ""Only a person totally unfamiliar with the issue could believe that CISA/DHS were not closely involved with content moderation at Twitter, to say nothing of other companies. Both she and Mehdi are wrong about this, and make their accusation in defiance of a lot of obvious documentary evidence.""

""Unfortunately there’s a new model, in which news organizations don’t address errors or audience complaints at all,"" he wrote. ""It’s from just such a media institution that Plaskett — while herself making an easily checkable mistake — got the idea to threaten prison for the kind of blunder we once would have consigned to the corrections page without a thought.""

And let me reiterate this: it’s the Biden family. It’s not just Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. It’s multiple members of this family that have been receiving questionable sums of money for reasons that we haven’t yet determined. But I can tell you, it’s all pointing back to Joe Biden and as I said on Sean Hannity's show the other day, the walls are closing in on the Biden family. It’s not just the president’s son.

Former college volleyball player hits back at soccer star Megan Rapinoe's 'absurd' stance on trans athletes,"Former division one athlete Adriana McLamb discusses the fight for fairness in women's sports. A former college volleyball player spoke out Friday against Democrats and high-profile female athletes who refuse to protect women's sports from transgender competitors. In June 2022 in honor of the anniversary of Title IX, U.S. Women's Soccer superstar Megan Rapinoe offered her take on the backlash towards transgender athletes in women's sports. ""I would also encourage everyone out there who is afraid someone’s going to have an unfair advantage over their kid to really take a step back and think what are we actually talking about here. We’re talking about people’s lives. I’m sorry, your kid’s high school volleyball team just isn’t that important. It’s not more important than any one kid’s life,"" Rapinoe told TIME. Adriana McLamb, a former Division I athlete at Rutgers and FIU, blasted the ""absurd"" comments. ""I think it's actually kind of absurd because we do care, especially as a volleyball player. We very much do care about your daughter's high school volleyball team,"" McLamb said on ""Fox & Friends"" Friday. MEGAN RAPINOE ‘100% SUPPORTIVE OF TRANS INCLUSION,’ IMPLORES PEOPLE TO LOOK AT ISSUE MORE BROADLY ""Especially in the case of Payton McNabb, who actually testified this week in North Carolina, who is severely concussed and injured by a biological man on the other side of a net. So we very much do care because this is not just about it being unfair for female athletes, but we're getting to the point that's unsafe."" McNabb, a senior at Hiwassee Dam High School in Murphy, N.C., said she suffered significant and long-term physical and mental injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a biological male who was able to compete on a girls’ team because of a policy put in place by the state’s high school athletic association. ""I'm here for every biological female athlete behind me. My little sister, my cousins, my teammates. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females is dangerous. I may be the first to come before you with an injury, but if this doesn't pass I won't be the last,"" she said during a press conference Wednesday, speaking out for the first time since her injuries. ESPN PERSONALITIES SLAM BIDEN'S TITLE IX PROPOSAL AMID UPROAR OVER TRANSGENDER ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTS McNabb called on state legislators to pass t​​he Fairness in Women's Sports Act that would prohibit biological males from competing on girls’ sports teams, citing her own experience. That same day, the act was passed by a 73-39 vote, with three Democrats supporting the measure. The debate surrounding transgender athletes in women's sports has grown heated especially since swimmer Lia Thomas started competing against biological women in 2021. Republicans have become staunch opponents of normalizing transgender athletes from competing against the opposite biological sex. ""How we got here was we've actually been saying this for a while. You had athletes like Selina Soule a few years back, and then the pinnacle was last year when Riley Gaines, another spokeswoman for IWC, competed against Lia Thomas. And we're now seeing it more and more common that we are seeing biological males and females sports,"" McLamb said. ""It's going to be the end of women's sports if we don't stop it."" On Thursday, the House of Representatives took a decisive stance on the debate passing the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. The act, also called the ""Save Women's Sports"" bill, was passed in a narrow 219-203 vote, with all Republicans voting ""yes"" and all Democrats voting ""no."" ""This bill isn't an anti-trans. It's pro-woman.

In the sport of volleyball, [in] the position I play…the male side is an average of over six feet tall. I'm five-four. I would never be able to compete against a biological male. There's reasons why the net is higher. There's a difference in baseball and softball fields. And there's a reason Title IX was fought so, so hard for 50 years ago, so we had these separate categories, so we can all play on a fair playing field.""

‘View’ co-host gives surprising take on what's behind increase in mass shootings: 'Degradation of church',"""The View"" co-host Sara Haines gave a surprisingly poignant reason for the increase in mass shootings across the country, claiming that Americans not going to church anymore is contributing to the tragedy. ""The View"" co-host Sara Haines on Friday offered a nuanced, thoughtful explanation for the increase in mass shootings across the country, claiming that Americans not going to church anymore is contributing to the tragedy. Rather than solely blame guns for the prevalence of mass shootings in America, Haines told her fellow co-hosts that cultural decline fostered by social media, porn, and video game addiction, along with a drop in church attendance, have eroded the ""connection"" and ""empathy"" between people. She claimed that church helps foster in people a ""morality component"" and ""duty to serve"" communities and families, and claimed that lack of love in society seems to reflect the drop in church attendance.

(Screenshot/ABC) The ""View"" co-hosts began talking about several high-profile gun violence incidents that occurred in the country in recent days. In addition to noting that guns play a role, including legal and illegal firearms, Haines trotted out societal factors that may have contributed to the shootings. She first noted that the shooters have been majority male, but then went deeper, noting the factors that may make these perpetrators so violent and careless toward human life. She began saying, ""This is definitely a male problem. It’s a gun problem. But I think looping them all together, you’ve got to take gun problems in lanes. There are criminal guns that are illegally obtained, there are legally attained weapons that are most common in honestly school shootings, then you’ve the Second Amendment.""

Veterans Affairs medical facilities to continue to provide taxpayer funded abortions after close Senate vote,"Former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy gives his take on the Trump indictment and the Supreme Court extending access to an abortion drug on 'The Story.' The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical facilities will continue to provide abortions on taxpayers' dime after a vote to overturn the rule failed on Wednesday. The resolution put forth by Republican Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville in February to stop the VA from providing taxpayer-funded abortions at its medical facilities failed to advance for a final vote, 48-51. Two Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats to block the Senate from voting on the legislation's final passage. Abortion rights protesters participate in nationwide demonstrations following the leaked Supreme Court opinion suggesting the possibility of overturning the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision, in Houston, Texas, U.S., May 14, 2022.  (REUTERS/Callaghan O'Hare) On September 9, 2022, the VA announced its plans to begin providing abortion services for veterans and their dependents through the taxpayer-funded VA health care system, which Republicans in favor of the voted-down resolution said is a blatant violation of Section 106 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. COLORADO HEALTHCARE CLINIC SUES STATE OVER LAW BANNING USE OF HORMONE THAT REVERSES EFFECTS OF ABORTION PILL Tuberville, along with Texas Republican Rep. Michael Cloud, introduced the bicameral joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse the rule, which they argued broke both state and federal laws. Before the rule went into effect, abortions were not covered under the VAs medical benefits. The CRA gives Congress the authority to review major rules issued by federal agencies before they take effect and if it disapproves of a rule, the rule doesn't stand. ""Last year, the VA announced they would begin providing taxpayer-funded abortions. Last year. This is something the VA has never, ever done before. Let me repeat that,"" Sen. Tuberville said during his remarks on the resolution. ""The VA has never done abortions. In fact, the VA has been prohibited — by the body — from performing abortions at its facilities for more than 30 years. The 102nd Congress — 1991 and 1992 — made taxpayer-funded abortions at VA facilities illegal … They did this with the bipartisan Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.

NBC News retracts report after ‘recklessly’ claiming 21-year-old migrant was underage slaughterhouse worker,"NBC News admits it got the age of a person wrong who it thought was a minor working in a Kansas slaughterhouse. NBC News was forced to issue a significant retraction this week after falsely reporting a slaughterhouse employed an underage migrant worker when the left-wing network learned he was really a 21-year-old man. Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI) blasted NBC in a statement following the retraction, saying the scandal-plagued network ""recklessly"" broadcasted inaccurate information that could have been avoided if it simply worked with the company. ""PSSI repeatedly implored NBC News to identify the individual in question before airing this segment to help us investigate the matter and enforce our long-standing, zero-tolerance policy against employing anyone under 18. Unfortunately, NBC refused to do so, leading the network to recklessly broadcast a false story,"" PSSI said. It began on April 12 when ""NBC Nightly News"" ran a segment to accompany an online report that said a 16-year-old migrant anonymously identified simply as ""Pedro"" spoke out against the dangers of working the overnight shift cleaning a slaughterhouse. NBC News was forced to issue a humiliating retraction this week after falsely reporting a slaughterhouse employed an underage migrant worker. NBC NEWS’ QUIET REMOVAL OF ‘WEINSTEIN’S BEST PR PERSON’ NOAH OPPENHEIM RAISES INDUSTRY EYEBROWS ""That hazardous work, illegal for anyone under 18,"" reporter Julia Ainsley said as NBC showed viewers unnerving images of bloody floors of the PSSI slaughterhouse in Dodge City, Kansas. ""Where they kill the cows, I have to clean the blood of the cows, until I finish,"" the man referred to as Pedro said. The NBC News reporter then said Pedro’s shift ends with ""just enough time"" for him to shower and make it to high school. ""Pedro says he has been working there since he was 15,"" Ainsley said before noting that PSSI previously settled with the U.S. Labor Dept. after investigators uncovered underage workers. NBC NEWS PRESIDENT SAYS HIS NETWORK DOES NOT DO 'ADVOCACY JOURNALISM' ""As part of its settlement, PSSI pledged it would no longer hire children and paid a $1.5 million fine… but Pedro is still on the job,"" the reporter said. Ainsley ended by noting that PSSI was looking to find the real identity of the man referred to as Pedro, because the company didn’t want any minors illegally working for it. The problem for NBC News was that Pedro was not a 16-year-old boy despite what the network told viewers. NBC News posted an embarrassing editor’s note atop the updated online story. ""This article replaces one published by NBC News on April 12, 2023, about a migrant worker at a Kansas slaughterhouse. That article has been withdrawn in light of new information that the migrant is not a minor,"" NBC News editors wrote. NBC News’ updated story began by reporting a ""Guatemalan migrant who claimed he worked as a minor cleaning a slaughterhouse in Kansas by night while attending high school during the day is actually 21, NBC News has learned."" NBC'S LESTER HOLT SAYS WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR BOTH SIDES TO DEFINE THE TRUTH: ‘FAIRNESS IS OVERRATED’ Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI) blasted NBC in a statement following the concerning retraction, saying the network ""recklessly"" broadcasted inaccurate information that could have been avoided if it simply worked with the company. NBC corrected its online story on Wednesday, before ""NBC Nightly News"" aired. However, the network didn’t address the gaffe on air until Thursday with a brief mention by anchor Lester Holt. ""We want to update you on a report we brought you last week. NBC News has learned a Guatemalan migrant featured in a ‘Nightly News’ story who said he was a minor while working overnight cleaning at a slaughterhouse in Kansas is actually 21 years old. The young man had initially told NBC News and the U.S. government he was 16,"" Holt said before quickly moving on. PSSI said that after the segment ran, the company immediately reviewed its entire workforce to search for the individual claiming to be a minor. ""When our investigation found this individual, we interviewed him and he said was not a minor. NBC News has since admitted he is 21 years old. This individual said he left Guatemala a year ago and was detained by U.S. border officials when crossing into America. To obtain release, he said he presented his younger brother’s birth certificate to falsely claim he was underage — given the federal government’s policy of letting unaccompanied minors stay in the country,"" PSSI said in a statement. ""According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they have caught hundreds of adults falsely claiming to be minors to avoid deportation. When this individual applied to work at PSSI, he presented false identification that cleared the federal government’s own E-Verify system. However, our investigation found no evidence that he is a minor — contrary to NBC News’ report,"" PSSI continued. ""We presented the findings of our investigation to NBC News and reserve all our legal rights."" WOMEN’S GROUP CALLS FOR DEMS TO PULL MSNBC DEBATE AMID ‘CULTURE OF SEXUAL ABUSE’ AT NBC NEWS PSSI continues to insist it has a zero-tolerance policy against employing anyone under the age of 18. It's the latest instance of the network having to admit a significant error. NBC mysteriously retracted reporter Miguel Almaguer’s November story that suggested Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, might not have been in immediate danger when police arrived at his San Francisco home the night he was assaulted by suspect David DePape. ""Miguel f----d up,"" an NBC News insider said at the time. ""It’s not clear that he had anything approaching two sources, and it’s not clear that the first source was more than a tip."" NBC News has not publicly explained what was wrong with the retracted report aside from a brief line that it didn’t meet standards. Media watchdogs have called for greater transparency from NBC to no avail. The bodycam footage of the attack that came out this year confirmed some aspects of NBC's report, but contradicted a key claim that Pelosi walked several feet back toward his eventual assailant after police arrived.

"Three Florida Republicans picking Trump over DeSantis, believe he can win 2024 rematch against Biden","Florida Republican Reps. Cory Mills, Greg Steube, and Byron Donalds shared their opinions on the potential presidential bid from Ron DeSantis Some Florida Republicans are coming out to show their support for former President Trump for president in 2024. Reps. Cory Mills, Greg Steube, and Byron Donalds joined ""America's Newsroom"" to explain their support for Trump over their home state Gov. Ron DeSantis, who many predict will enter the race. Steube said that in five years, Governor DeSantis has not reached out to him personally. ""There's been multiple opportunities where I have gone up to him and talked to him, giving him my cell phone number, asked him to reach out to me. There have been events in my district that I was specifically in, told I couldn't be part of the press conference, told to go stand in the corner, was not allowed to be participating in that when he was in my district,"" he told Bill Hemmer. WHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE On policy, Steube said he believes in the ""America First agenda"" and trusts that Trump is the one who can get the job done. ""There is no other candidate for the Republican nominee that can go in day one and do what we need to have done in our country and reverse all the disastrous policies of this Biden administration. And that is President Trump, said Stuebe. ""I am looking forward to fighting on Team Trump."" Donalds said his endorsement is not about DeSantis but based on his belief in Trump's record as president previously. ""You got to be able to hit the ground running on day one. We know Donald Trump can do it. He did it once before, he can do it again. If you look at our country from a foreign policy perspective, we know all the domestic issues. China is on the move, they see weakness at the White House. The next commander-in-chief has got to be able to do the job of commander-in-chief on day one. We know Donald Trump can do that job."" Mills said Democrats and the mainstream media know Trump can defeat Biden this time around. ""The reason they're going after President Trump is because he is the one who can actually defeat Joe Biden in the White House, take back our country, get it back on track, and start actually leading the country where it needs to go. They know that and that's why they're coming after him. But America stands behind President Trump."" Biden has not officially announced he will run for re-election, but told a reporter last week in Ireland that his ""plan is to run again."" Steube said in his district near Sarasota, Florida, Trump has overwhelming support over other candidates, including DeSantis. Donalds said this race would be different from 2020. ""What I believe is you're going to have President Trump and President Biden in front of these voters. And the simple question is who did the job better? And it is without question that Donald Trump did a significantly better job than what Joe Biden is doing currently. That's going to be your question in '24. And I think that suburban moms looking at inflation, looking at the indoctrination that's happening in our schools, they're going to say, you know what? These Democrats have led us the completely wrong way."" Mills said, ""Governor DeSantis has done a great job as governor, but President Trump has shown to be a great president."" The launch of Trump's third straight presidential campaign in November was followed by only a trickle of endorsements from Republican members of Congress. However, as Trump's position as the clear front-runner in the burgeoning 2024 Republican presidential nomination race has become more pronounced this spring, the pace of congressional endorsements has accelerated. He can now boast the backing of roughly 50 House Republicans and nine GOP senators. He also enjoys the backing of Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, the state that holds the third contest in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

Podcast host Joe Rogan leveled Anheuser-Busch for releasing ""the dumbest commercial of all time"" last week after losing billions in value since it partnered with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. The company's Budweiser ad features one of the brand's famous Clydesdale horses traversing the country from New York City to the Grand Canyon, passing by scenes in the American heartland as a narrator delivers a patriotic message.

‘Radical feminists’ torch Democrats for opposing women's sports legislation: 'This is a pro-girl bill',"Kara Dansky and Lierre Keith discuss why they, self-described radical feminists, support Republicans bill that would ban transgender women from competing against females. `Two self-described ""radical feminists"" joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Friday to voice their support for House Republicans' ""Protection of Women and Girls in Sports"" bill. The bill would ban transgender women from competing in federally funded schools’ female sports teams. More specifically, it claims that allowing trans women to play in female sports violates Title IX, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex. A transgender woman refers to someone who was born with male sex traits and now identifies as a woman. The bill received no votes from any House Democrats and is not expected to move forward in the Democrat-led Senate.

She added, ""Women have a right to a word for ourselves, and that word is woman, and men can't have it.

"Trans woman showered with four Wisconsin high school girls, violated their privacy, letter to district claims","Riley Gaines, who swam against UPenn's Lia Thomas, says including transgender athletes into women's sports shows 'utter disregard' toward females on 'The Ingraham Angle.' A letter sent by a law group on Thursday claimed that the Wisconsin-based Sun Praire Area School District [SPASD] has not ""adequately"" addressed a violation of students’ privacy rights after a transgender woman walked into a shower with four high school freshmen girls inside of it. The letter, written by the Wisconsin Institute of Law and Liberty (WILL) urges a response by the SPASD to resolve the issue and claims its actions have ""been completely inadequate."" ""We are calling on you to address this immediately and put policies in place that will protect the safety and privacy of all students (and provide public notice of what those policies are),"" WILL attorneys wrote. Fox News Digital saw an email from the Sun Prairie East High School principal that acknowledged the incident and said the situation should have never happened. (iStock) According to the letter, titled ""Serious Violation of Girls’ Privacy Rights in Sun Prairie East Locker Room,"" four Sun Prairie East High School freshmen girls were disturbed when an alleged ""undressed"" 18-year-old transgender woman came into the locker room and got into the showers with the girls. RILEY GAINES RIPS BIDEN ADMIN AS LIA THOMAS EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR TITLE IX CHANGES WILL attorneys’ letter claims that on March 3, four freshmen girls at EHS participated in a swim unit as part of their first-hour physical education class. After the class, the girls entered the girls’ athletic locker room to shower and change for class. However, upon entering, they noticed the transgender student, a senior, in the area containing lockers and benches. WILL claim that the transgender student was 18 years old at the time of the incident. The girls said that the transgender student was not in the first-hour PE class they were participating in. The letter went on to say that the girls were surprised to see the transgender student in the locker room, although it additionally notes that they knew that the student identifies as transgender and had used girls’ bathrooms before. The girls proceeded to use the shower without interacting with the transgender student. Furthermore, WILL claimed that the girls entered the shower area with their swimsuits on to rinse off, a practice that is common after swimming in PE class. Moreover, the letter alleges that the transgender student entered the girls’ shower area, approached them, and announced ""I’m trans, by the way."" BIDEN TO VETO GOP BILL PROTECTING WOMEN'S SPORTS, CALLS IT 'DISCRIMINATION' AGAINST TRANSGENDER STUDENTS An empty classroom with the chairs up. (Peter Kneffel/picture alliance ) The letter alleges that the transgender student ""undressed fully and showered completely naked right next to one of the girls."" ""He was initially turned towards the wall but eventually turned and fully exposed his male genitalia to the four girls."" The incident was first reported to student services. WILL argues that the SPASD's actions following the first report were not sufficient to resolve the issue. They asserted that ""SPASD did not follow its own policy in this instance regarding District Response to Alleged Sexual Harassment."" WILL wrote, ""Under federal law, the incident should have been reported to the Title IX coordinator, who should have then contacted the girls, offered supportive measures, and provided them an opportunity to file a complaint."" They explain further, ""Supportive measures might have included accommodations to maintain their access to education and adequate privacy in the locker room at least while a Title IX investigation was pending. No one from the District contacted any of the girls’ parents at that time, and no one investigated. To be clear, that means that the District’s initial response to this incident violated Title IX.""

""The District cannot answer your question of why the parents allegedly claim that District’s actions have been inadequate, and frankly we are not certain that statement is accurate.

Fetterman admits he was 'not the kind of senator' Pennsylvanians deserved when hospitalized,"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., raised eyebrows on Wednesday with his choppy opening statement in the first subcommittee hearing he's chaired since returning from the hospital. NPR spoke to Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., about returning to Congress after spending the first few months of his first Senate term in the hospital for depression. In the exchange, the stroke survivor admitted that during his time away he felt like he was ""not the kind of senator"" that his state deserved, and that he was not the family man he should have been. He also noted some of the advice doctors gave him to treat his depression, including staying away from news and social media. SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN TALKS MENTAL HEALTH POST-HOSPITALIZATION: ‘MESSAGE RIGHT NOW ISN’T POLITICAL' Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., arrives at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on Monday. Fetterman is returning to the Senate following six weeks of treatment for clinical depression. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Although Fetterman could not serve in full capacity at the beginning of his term — something even mainstream media warned about due to his rocky recovery from a stroke last year — the outlet turned it into a plus. The interview began with praise for Fetterman’s ""transparency"" on mental health issues that he portrayed throughout his treatment for depression. NPR stated, ""Fetterman's public acknowledgment of his own mental health struggles is rare for politicians, even as depression has become an increasingly common challenge for Americans."" It then added, ""With his transparency, Fetterman has created a platform for discussing mental health issues, and encouraged other politicians to share their own stories."" The outlet asked Fetterman about his feelings on returning to the Senate, to which he replied he was happy. He claimed his reaction was ""just a big smile,"" and added, ""I’ve really missed being here."" Fetterman also acknowledged that his health problems derailed him as a senator, husband and father. He said, ""And when I was in the throes of depression, if I was being 100% honest, I was not the kind of senator that was deserved by Pennsylvanians. I wasn't the kind of partner that I owe to my wife, Gisele, or to my children, Karl, Grace, and August."" SEN. FETTERMAN TWEETS IMAGE HOLDING 420 FLAG TO ACKNOWLEDGE CANNABIS HOLIDAY Sen.

(Office of Fetterman) Fetterman detailed the extent of his depression before finally going into remission. The lawmaker claimed, ""I was so depressed that I didn't even realize I was depressed. I didn't even understand it. This, to me, just became the new normal. I wasn't realizing [that] I wasn't eating. I didn't realize that I wasn't really drinking much."" He also admitted, ""I dropped 25 pounds. And sometimes I would say things, incoherent things, and I would become kind of just [disoriented], and getting lost walking around in Washington."" Fetterman also mentioned his hesitation when given the option of being treated for depression, saying, ""They knew that I wasn't right. But even at that moment, I still kind of pushed back about it, too, sometimes saying, 'Are you sure, I don't really need it.'"" The senator drew on his own experience to encourage others to get help if they think they might need it, saying, ""Get treatment, and get help. If I'd had done that years ago, I would not have had to put my family and myself and my colleagues [through] that if I had gotten help."" Fetterman also shared some guidance the doctors gave him for his recovery. The outlet wrote, ""Part of Fetterman's recovery per his doctors includes staying away from cable television news and social media — which might be good advice for everyone to follow.""

"ESPN hosts break with liberals on trans women in sports, Disney-owned network ‘chooses to remain woke’","OutKick host Charly Arnolt discusses her decision to leave ESPN as top female hosts on the network speak out on the need to protect women athletes. In recent years, ESPN has become synonymous with liberal talking points as the Disney-owned network regularly pushes left-leaning ideology when it ventures into politics. That’s why it was so shocking when two of its biggest stars criticized the Biden administration’s plan to block states from banning transgender students from competing against the gender they identify as. ESPN personalities Samantha Ponder and Sage Steele, two of the network’s most prominent women, expressed support for Riley Gaines, a former decorated NCAA swimmer at Kentucky who has been an outspoken critic of biological men being allowed to compete against biological women. ""Women with influential platforms are beginning to speak out to the injustice of men competing against women. These women in particular have a lot to lose by using their voice, yet chose to anyways. That is what courage is. I'm so honored to be able to lean on them as we continue forward with advocating for sex-protected sporting categories,"" Gaines told Fox News Digital. Steele declared that she stands with Gaines and called what has occurred with trans people overtaking women’s sports ""ridiculous,"" ""heartbreaking,"" ""difficult to watch"" and added the hashtag ""savewomensports.""

""It is a shame that we are needing to fight for the integrity of Title IX in 2023 and the reason it was needed in the first place,"" Ponder wrote. ESPN’s Samantha Ponder expressed support for Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer who has been an outspoken critic of transgender women being allowed to compete against biological women.  (Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM) Adriana McLamb, a spokeswoman for the Independent Women’s Forum and former Division 1 volleyball player, believes Gaines and other like-minded female athletes are on the right side of history in the debate over trans athletes. ""It is promising to see big names like Sage Steele and Sam Ponder speak out even though their employer ESPN chooses to remain woke,"" McLamb told Fox News Digital. ""Now more than ever, it is important for us as female athletes to rally behind Riley Gaines and fight for Title IX,"" McLamb continued. ""We are fighting for all current and future female athletes to compete on a fair playing field just like our predecessors fought for our right to compete to begin with."" Ex-ESPN personality Charly Arnolt, who joined OutKick earlier this month, believes she was ""a little bit stifled"" at her former company. She left to have the freedom to express herself about important issues such as the trans debate. ""I have to commend these two women for standing up for these women who, unfortunately, are losing so much of the success that they worked so hard for,"" Arnolt said Thursday on ""America’s Newsroom."" ESPNs Sage Steele also expressed support for Riley Gaines. (Meg Oliphant/Getty Images) ""As far as ESPN, I don’t really know what their plan is, as far as whether they talk to these women or address it on-air,"" Arnolt continued. ""I would hope that this would be something they would address, but up to this point they remain completely mum on this topic, so I’m not sure exactly what happens."" ESPN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ponder and Steele supporting Gaines. The ESPN anchors spoke out this week when Gaines tweeted criticism of a video made by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who donned a shirt that said, ""trans athletes belong in sports,"" and insisted ""trans kids"" will continue ""losing opportunities"" unless the Biden administration forces change. ""Under the guise of competitive fairness? Are you really trying to say you would have won a national title against the men? Does it not break your heart to see women lose out on these opportunities? The Biden Admins proposed bill denies science, truth, and common sense,"" Gaines wrote to accompany Thomas’ video. ESPN SILENT FOLLOWING 'SICK AND EVIL' COMMENT COMPARING US VOTING RIGHTS ISSUES TO CHINA HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ""This take is selfish and shows an utter disregard for women,"" Gaines continued. ""The Biden Administration is actively and aggressively working to pass laws that erase decent and fair treatment for women in sports."" Ponder and Steele first expressed their support by responding to Gaines’ tweet. Gaines, now a spokeswoman for the Independent Women’s Forum, famously tied Thomas for fifth place in the 200 Freestyle finals at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships last year. Thomas’ situation sparked a national debate over whether transgender woman should be permitted to compete in sports against biological women. The GOP-controlled House on Thursday passed legislation aimed at preventing biological males from competing as transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s sports at schools across the country, after a debate in which several Democrats accused Republicans of ""bullying"" transgender students. The bill is certain to die in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Gaines’ side-eye glare at Thomas became a flashpoint for the polarizing debate, and the former Kentucky swimmer has since emerged as a conservative icon for speaking out. ESPN has fawned over Thomas, even celebrating the trans swimmer during Women’s History Month. Riley Gaines, now a spokeswoman for the Independent Women’s Forum, famously tied Lia Thomas for fifth place in the 200 Freestyle finals at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships last year.  (Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports) ""The Texas native competed for three seasons on the men’s swim team at the University of Pennsylvania.

OutKick founder Clay Travis, who points out ESPN’s liberal messaging on a regular basis, praised Steele and Ponder for offering ""significant"" support of Gaines and biological females. ""Most people in sports media, who are men or women, don’t make substantial enough money to feel like they have great job security and so when you actually break this down, I give credit to Riley Gaines, I give credit to Sage Steele, Sam Ponder for being able to speak out, and willing to speak out,"" Travis said on ""OutKick the Show."" ""A lot of people are terrified of being labeled transphobic, or potentially losing their jobs, that they aren’t willing to speak out about this,"" Travis continued. ""I give credit to Sam Ponder; I give credit to Sage Steele… but they’re still the minority."" ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro landed the top job after his predecessor, John Skipper, shocked the media industry by suddenly resigning in late 2017 when a drug dealer attempted to extort him. The Skipper era saw ESPN take a dramatic turn to the left, and the network was accused of spending too much time glorifying Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protests and spouting left-wing talking points. ESPN'S SAGE STEELE PULLED OFF AIR AFTER KNOCKING COMPANY'S VACCINE MANDATE, COMMENTS ON OBAMA'S RACE Pitaro initially encouraged ESPN talent to pivot away from the political rhetoric that plagued the network during Skipper’s tenure, but a variety of racial and political topics have taken center stage on the self-described ""Worldwide Leader in Sports."" In recent memory, ESPN's Sarah Spain called some Tampa Bay Rays players ""bigots"" for not wearing a gay pride patch because of religious views, aired host Malika Andrews becoming emotional on-air after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and posted a segment online in which host Elle Duncan urged fathers to speak up so their daughters can have abortions. ESPN regular J.A. Adande compared ongoing human rights abuses committed by China to Republican election overhaul efforts in the U.S. when speaking about the Winter Olympics in Beijing, and star NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski sent a profane message to Sen.

Elisa Tambunga, who lost her seven-year-old daughter, and Gin Jespersen, who lost her mother, joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Friday to describe being face-to-face with Mayorkas after tragedy hit their family. Mayorkas stood up and offered his condolences to the family after being prompted by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas. BORDER PATROL CHIEF SAYS DHS DOESN'T HAVE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF US BORDER ""Honestly, it was asked of him. He didn't do it because he thought it was right. It was asked for by Mr. Pfluger for him to do that. And at this point, not just Secretary Mayorkas, but no one's apologies mean anything to me or to my family without any action behind it,"" said Tambunga. She clarified that she received a sincere apology from Mayorkas in their private meeting, but she viewed the apology during the hearing as insincere.

""They're sitting right behind you. They came here today because they want answers. They came here today because of the failures of you and your leadership. They came here because they want closure,"" said Pfluger. Mayorkas did stand and express condolences to the Tambunga family present — although he also accused Pfluger of politicizing the tragedy. Jespersen said her family has been trying for a while to get the attention of Mayorkas.

We were adamant that we needed troops down there and the accident, the killing … happened because there is no Texas DPS over the Interstate of Crockett County in Ozona Texas,"" said Jespersen. The family is taking action and urging Mayorkas to make a change. ""We asked him for troops. We asked him to partner with the Democrats and the Republicans. We said we're not about red or blue today. We're not about who's wrong or right. We're about working together. And we said, under your leadership, it's not working."" ""It's just everywhere in all of South Texas, in our hometown.

""I just plead with him to please hear us out. And that when he goes to advise President Biden that instead of having the congressman's and congresswoman's thoughts in the back of his mind to have our faces in the back of his mind because that's who ultimately he's needing to protect is us.""

Jordan torches Biden: He made Hunter laptop intel letter 'seem organic' after Blinken outed as 'impetus',"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan sounds off on 'The Ingraham Angle' following Morell testimony, claims from IRS official's lawyer. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said then-candidate Joe Biden wrongly made the letter from 51 intelligence officials claiming Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation ""seem organic"" despite allegedly knowing his soon-to-be State Department chief helped ""strategize"" it. The letter, signed by 51 individuals — including Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan, Bush-era CIA Director Michael Hayden, former DNI James Clapper, former CIA chief of staff Jeremy Bash, former acting CIA Director Michael Morell and former National Intelligence Council Chair Thomas Finger — asserted the laptop had ""classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."" Morell testified before Jordan's committee and that of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, that then-Biden campaign adviser Antony Blinken was ""the impetus"" behind the October 2020 letter's inception. ""When the story came out on Oct. 14, 2020, about the ‘Biden business operation’ and whether then-Vice President Joe Biden was involved, there was some concern that he was — then quickly it turns into this political operation — that letter that became the basis for suppressing the story and keeping it from the American people just days before the most important election we have,"" Jordan said.

Mike Morell looks at it the next day, organizes on the 18th all these other people to sign the letter. The 19th, the letter goes out."" Jordan added Morell concocted the letter in time for the NBC presidential debate on Oct. 22 because he thought then-President Donald Trump would bring up the laptop issue, which he did. Morell and Blinken wanted a statement Joe Biden could use to rebut Trump's likely allegations, ""because, as Mr. Morell said, they wanted [Biden] to win,"" he continued. The laptop indeed did come up, to which Biden cited the letter, and Trump wondered aloud if the public was to believe the laptop was therefore another ""Russia, Russia, Russia [hoax].""

""It was a total political operation, and the most important fact is [the letter] was false. [The laptop] wasn't Russian disinformation. The laptop story looks to be true."" Jordan and host Laura Ingraham said Trump's stated concern the letter was politicized turned out to be correct. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The way then-Vice President Biden did it was he made it seem like it was organic — and understand it was choreographed all the way,"" Jordan added.

""That's the scariest thing of all,"" he said. ""And that letter became the basis for keeping this information from the American people.""

Twitter removed its controversial ""government-funded media"" labels from NPR and the CBC, after the two taxpayer-funded media outlets took a break from the platform in protest. State-affiliated tags were also removed from other state-run media outlets in foreign autocracies, like Russia’s RT and China’s Xinhua.

Jean-Pierre faces blowback for 'disprovable lies' about Florida education law: 'Red herrings all the way down',"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed that the expansion of Floridas ""dystopian"" education law prevents gay teachers from showing their spouses. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was blasted on social media for calling Florida’s education law ""dystopian,"" claiming gay teachers cannot show pictures of their spouses anymore. Prior to answering questions at Thursday’s press conference, Jean-Pierre addressed the Florida Board of Education’s recent expansion of Gov.

Critics blast Dem Rep. Stacey Plaskett for threatening journalist Matt Taibbi with jail time: 'Party of norms',"Journalist Matt Taibbi, who collaborated on the Twitter Files, sounds off on 'The Story.' Top House Democrat Stacey Plaskett, V.I., is facing intense backlash for threatening jail time towards independent journalist Matt Taibbi over his testimony about the Twitter Files at last month's Congressional hearing. ""Sure is getting fashy around here,"" reacted fellow Twitter Files journalist Michael Shellenberger, who testified alongside Taibbi at the hearing. Shellenberger later added, ""It is an honor to be invited to be an expert witness. Not only are we unpaid, we pay our own travel. What @StaceyPlaskett has done is a disgrace. Why would anyone choose to testify if they’re going to threatened with prison? Talk about a grotesque attack on norms. For shame."" Del. Stacey Plaskett, D-V.I., the ranking member of the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, sent a letter to Taibbi regarding a comment he told lawmakers, which she alleged included an error that was previously propped up by MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan in a tense interview exchange regarding the name of one of the federal agencies swept up in the Twitter Files. JOURNALIST MATT TAIBBI THREATENED WITH PRISON TIME FOR PERJURY BY TOP DEMOCRAT OVER TWITER FILES TESTIMONY The error was a specific reference to CISA, the government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, when he meant to refer to CIS, the Center for Internet Security, which is a private organization. Taibbi later addressed and corrected the error in his reporting. Democratic Rep.

Yep, there's no weaponization and hyper-politicization of the ruling regime against its political foes -- particularly those claiming it is weaponized and hyper-politicized,"" The Federalist senior contributor Benjamin Weingarten summarized. Rep. Plaskett's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. In the letter sent to Taibbi, Plaskett cited his alleged erroneous statement, saying it is ""contradicted by your own admission."" ""This mistake is important because, by adding an ‘A,' you weren't making a harmless spelling error. Rather, you were alleging that CISA — a government entity — was working with the EIP [Election Integrity Partnership] to have posts removed from social media,"" Plaskett wrote to Taibbi, according to a letter obtained by journalist and fellow Twitter Files reporter Lee Fang on Thursday. ""When presented with this misinformation, you acknowledged you had made ‘an error’ by intentionally altering the acronym CIS and you subsequently deleted your erroneous tweet."" Plaskett continued, ""Prior to your appearance before the subcommittee on March 9, you signed the Judiciary Committee's Truth in Testimony form, certifying that you understand that ‘knowingly providing material false information to this committee/subcommittee or knowingly concealing material information from this committee/subcommittee, is a crime (18 U.S.C. 1001). In addition, at the beginning of the March 9 hearing, you swore ‘under penalty of perjury that the testimony you [were] about to give [was] true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief.' Under the federal perjury statue, 18 U.S.C. 1621, proving false information is punishable by up to five years imprisonment."" The IRS allegedly showed up at Taibbi's home on the same day he gave his testimony to Congress about his findings from the Twitter Files. (Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage) But as Fang noted in his reporting, the specific comments Taibbi told Congress that Plaskett cited ""were correct"" despite the original error in his Twitter Files reporting. Plaskett, a non-voting Democratic delegate from the Virgin Islands, had a contentious exchange with Taibbi at last month's hearing, referring to him as a ""so-called journalist"" and grilled him to reveal his source for his Twitter Files reporting, who she suspected was Twitter owner Elon Musk.

Former Navy pilot who's seen UFOs asks Biden to investigate: Anything from foreign tech to 'space aliens',"Ryan Graves, a former Navy fighter pilot, is calling on Biden to lead the investigation into unidentified aerial phenomenon or risk American national security. Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves said that if the Biden administration does not investigate UFOs in American airspace, then the U.S. risks being outmaneuvered by a foreign power. Graves, who has testified that he has witnessed unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) during his career as a fighter pilot, was responding to a congressional hearing from Wednesday. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, who is director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) under the Pentagon, warned Congress about the dangers of UAPs during his testimony. Graves broke down Dr. Kirkpatrick's testimony during an interview with Fox News Digital. The former fighter pilot told Fox News Digital that President Biden has a responsibility to tell the American people honestly what is happening in the skies above their heads. Ryan Graves noted that there was a ""friction"" between government agencies that need to be removed if the U.S. wants to respond to the possible threat of UAPs. EX-NAVY PILOT WHO'S SEEN UFOS IN FLIGHT CALLS FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF AERIAL PHENOMENA: 'WE NEED TO BE CURIOUS' ""I think Biden holds the hammer on communication on this topic. I think that from the executive branch, they need to ensure the American people that they serve have the communication flow and the comfort and the leadership in the Department of Defense and the organization is now set up to do that."" Graves noted that there was a ""friction"" between government agencies that need to be removed if the U.S. is able to respond to the possible threat of UAPs. ""I believe that if the Biden administration, the interagency task force that they set up can help bring those different agencies together, then it's going to be the Biden administration's responsibility to communicate the results of that investigation,"" he said. ""In the past,"" Graves explained, ""the description and the shape of the objects was classified. In this hearing, we learned that about 50% of the objects are spherical in description. And then there's a plethora of other descriptions of smaller probabilities that they discussed. They also showed that the objects were essentially operating in all the U.S. operational areas."" Graves continued, ""That includes the East and West Coast as well as over the ""actual continental United States."" Former Navy fighter pilot Ryan Graves speaks to reporters after a House Intelligence subcommittee hearing on UFOs, officially called unidentified aerial phenomena, on May 17, 2022. (Tyler Olson/Fox News) UAPs have been spotted in ""operational areas off of Japan and in the Middle East as well,"" he added. Some of these UAPs, Graves explained, were at altitudes ""right smack dab in the center of our airspace,"" also making them a ""serious aviation safety issue."" ""The primary shape of these objects is spherical,"" Graves said, adding that Dr. Kirkpatrick described some of the spheres as ""clear,"" ""opaque"" or even ""translucent."" The UAP expert even mentioned ""emissions in the radio frequency band"" from the UAPs as well as ""frequency ranges that were associated with the detection capabilities,"" according to Graves. Graves agreed with Dr. Kirkpatrick’s assessment that the Department of Defense should implement procedures for UAPs into their operations and ""normalize"" the discussion of UFOs. The possibilities for these flying objects could be anything from a foreign technology ""all the way to space aliens,"" as Graves said, summarizing Dr. Kirkpatrick's testimony. FORMER FIGHTER PILOT SAYS UFOS MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE THINK: 'WE WERE SEEING THEM ON OUR RADARS’ UFO seen in clip released by Department of Defense. A Pentagon watchdog is launching a probe into the actions taken by the Department of Defense after a series of UFO sightings in recent years. (Department of Defense) ""But right now,"" he added, ""I don't know if there's enough collaboration and cooperation between the individual branches and organizations"" for people like Dr. Kirkpatrick to be able to investigate the UAPs. Graves said that the American public has shifted to a ""sense of urgency"" about the potential national security threats of UAPs. The views of the public on UAP have also been affected by media coverage, which in the U.S., Graves said, ""has matured quite a bit compared to the rest of the world."" That is because people take UAPs ""much more seriously than before,"" Graves said. ""We've seen how this can be a very realistic national security issue if we just laugh off these unidentified aircraft."" Those national security threats could potentially be catastrophic, he added. ""I'm almost hesitant to make this comparison,"" Graves said, pausing slightly, ""but we've seen what massive intelligence failures can lead to.

"Future of AI: New tech will create ‘digital humans,’ could use more energy than all working people by 2025","CTA Thematic Programs Director Brian Comiskey and tech strategist, author David Espindola discuss how artificial intelligence will continue to change how businesses operate and the impact on consumers. Artificial intelligence will be capable of producing higher-quality ""digital humans"" and could use more energy than the entire global workforce by 2025, according to experts. Brian Comiskey, the Director of Thematic Programs for the Consumer Technology Association, revealed the trade association had developed an artificial intelligence working group to navigate the new technology. With his time in thematic indexing, Comiskey noted that ""responsible AI"" is a growing buzzword in the financial space and has become an increasing priority for leaders across various industries. By 2025, without sustainable AI practices, AI will consume more energy than the human workforce, significantly offsetting carbon-zero gains, according to Gartner's research for their 2023 strategic predictions. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR? Consumer Technology Association Thematic Director Brian Comiskey said that AI could use more energy than the entire human workforce by 2025 without sustainable AI practices.  (Fox News Digital ) ""The energy consumption by AI is growing rapidly along with increasing use to automate human activities. Machine learning (ML) models need to be trained and executed, which requires more cloud data centers,"" contributor Lori Perri wrote. ""Practices are emerging in order to significantly reduce energy consumption for ML. Before dismissing AI as a technology that consumes too much energy, note that the benefits of AI may potentially far outweigh its own footprint. However, this potential can only be realized if AI is proactively and effectively applied in as many processes, companies and organizations as possible."" Comiskey said this claim helps to reaffirm the environmental focus and guideline standards coming into play, where clients, especially overseas, are wondering not just how to standardize the tech but are also questioning how markets are building in financial investment vehicles to help ensure companies are investing in innovation. ""That's the most important thing,"" Comiskey said. ""We want to invest in innovation in our space. But is there a way to layer in a responsibility around, are we building this at the right pace ethically as well as from an environmental impact and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) sort of concerns?"" Comiskey said he anticipates a greater focus from companies on hiring people who can communicate with AI effectively, but also employees who can communicate the benefits and challenges of AI well to those without a technical background. A recent Stanford University AI index report found 2% of all total job postings are for AI and machine learning. Comiskey said companies expect to hire a large swathe of other people for AI integration, including those experienced in natural language processing, robotics and AI-powered search mechanisms. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS GRADE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF AI FROM ONE TO 10 TOPSHOT - A journalist watches an introductory video by the 'artificial intelligence' anchor Fedha on the twitter account of Kuwait News service, in Kuwait City on April 9, 2023. (Photo by YASSER AL-ZAYYAT / AFP) (Photo by YASSER AL-ZAYYAT/AFP via Getty Images) (YASSER AL-ZAYYAT/AFP via Getty Images) To eliminate biases and minimize risk in existing models, Comiskey said companies will need to build a team that is reflective of the overall racial and ethnic makeup of the U.S. Only 27% of AI teams in the country incorporate women and only 25% have racial or ethnic minorities on the team. Companies are also likely to expand their focus on cybersecurity. While ChatGPT and other AI chatbots can automate and help facilitate a more sophisticated scale, companies can benefit from implementing AI into their existing cybersecurity strategies, Comiskey said. According to an August 2022 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report, companies with fully deployed security AI and automation systems save $3.05 million per data breach on average compared to those without. Comiskey also anticipates the development of more in-house large language models tailored to the individual goals of the company, as well as the creation of new enterprises offering their own AI models. ""When you're talking about things like health data, financial data, when we work on a project, I'm sure we would have to consider how do we keep the data that's important to us behind closed doors. So, I think you'll see a lot of companies building their own model, but also the rise of companies that specialize in creating consulting services around customized private labs,"" he said. AI also has the potential to produce higher quality ""digital humans,"" a natural evolution of using chatbots to create full avatars of real people. For example, a South Korea-based company Deepbrain AI helped propel the country's new President, Yoon Suk-yeol, to victory. In early 2022, Suk-yeol used videos that featured an AI-generated video of himself to engage voters, making clear that citizens were watching a computer-generated image (CGI). HOW DEEPFAKES ARE ON THE VERGE OF DESTROYING POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY Rhonda Vetere, an author and technology industry expert, said business leaders should remember that corporate success is predicated on great teams and prioritizing people over machines.  (Rhonda Vetere) Comiskey said the idea could help companies and politicians engage better with young consumers and voters, describing it as a likely common output for AI in the long run. He also noted that AI has many other potential future capabilities, such as the opportunity for a ""virtuous circle"" wherein AI accelerates and improves the chips that help to power the technology in the first place. Furthermore, AI could be integral in sifting through the massive amounts of data produced daily, ultimately improving the e-commerce and entertainment space and moving closer to the needs of consumers. Rhonda Vetere, the CEO of Global Impact and a world-renowned CIO/CTO, told Fox News Digital that AI in the future could lead to greater innovation and productivity to solve complex problems. Still, people could risk being manipulated by an output that persuades or guides conversation if not properly understood. ""We have all heard of AI passing the bar exam. How AI is deployed and enables bad behavior is a concern. Is AI here, yes, and in my humble opinion, we should have a think tank across industry leaders to ensure we all understand the true capabilities and red flags,"" Vetere said. ""This will also ensure success. Instead of everyone racing to roll out AI capabilities, I would like for us to take a step back and ask, do we really understand the deep learning model calculations, outputs and ramifications?"" Vetere also suggested that AI should be regulated at the government level, similarly to how audits are done in the financial sector, to balance innovation with risks. ""Businesses will take advantage of the productivity generated by AI to manage repetitive tasks and reduce inefficiencies, but leaders need to remember corporate success is predicated on great teams and the importance of leadership recognizing the work of people over machines,"" Vetere said. CHATGPT CAN PREDICT THE STOCK MARKET AND UNDERSTAND FED STATEMENTS, STUDIES CLAIM David Espindola, a digital technology entrepreneur and the author ""Soulful: You in the Future of Artificial Intelligence"" said he believes AI will lead to ""technical unemployment."" (Fox News Digital ) She added that AI will make the spread of information faster and further increase productivity if used correctly. ""Expect there to be a tech clash and a race to the innovation finish line,"" Vetere predicted. David Espindola, a digital technology entrepreneur and the author of ""Soulful: You in the Future of Artificial Intelligence,"" told Fox News Digital that he believes AI will impact all industries and all companies. ""From a startup standpoint, you know, what we're seeing from AI is really quite remarkable. Just the number of startups that have come up recently. You know, there are over 1,000 startups working on AI specific applications that just came up in the last few months,"" Espindola said. ""I've been in this industry for more than 30 years. I've never seen anything with this velocity and this volume of business opportunities."" ""In my opinion, this is bigger than the Internet. I mean, this is the big one,"" he added. AI PAUSE CEDES POWER TO CHINA, HARMS DEVELOPMENT OF ‘DEMOCRATIC’ AI, EXPERTS WARN SENATE In terms of a large corporation, Espindola said AI will be very helpful in product development and research, enabling employees to understand the science behind their output and how to solve various problems. He added that AI will have a remarkable impact on creating new entertainment and digital assets. ""I just came from a couple of meetings yesterday with people that are in the communications and content creation business. And the impact is just incredible,"" Espindola said. ""With AI, I think these organizations will be able to much more quickly do the things that they've always done. But, you know, without AI, a typical content creation process might take four hours, five hours, six hours. With AI, they can do some of the same things in 30 minutes or less."" Speaking to the economy and employment, Espindola agrees with experts who believe that AI will eventually increase GDP and create new jobs. However, he predicts that the number of jobs reduced will outweigh the number of jobs created, especially in fields like software development. ""I think it will lead to technical unemployment. I think it's unavoidable,"" he said.

Surrounded by the app icons of Twitter, Chrome, Zoom, Telegram, Teams, Edge and Meet. (iStock) AI will also have a marketed impact on the productivity of the average person, freeing them up to engage in things that interest them, as opposed to repetitive rudimentary tasks, Espindola said. According to research, people's attention spans have decreased over the last 15 years, from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8.25 seconds in 2015. Espindola said that, in the short term, with the volume of information available online, he believes people's attention spans will continue to become shorter and shorter. But, in the long term, AI will do most or all of the manual or passionless work for people. ""We can use different skill sets like lateral thinking, which is the ability to really connect the dots from different domains. So, it will become our experts, if you will, and then the humans will have to develop the ability to ask the right questions of AI and then connect the dots in a way that you can synthesize that information in a cohesive story and a cohesive output. So, I think in the short term, we're going to become even busier than we already are and it's going to be even crazier than it is today,"" he said.

"Misinformation machines? Common sense the best guard against AI chatbot 'hallucinations,' experts say","College students Tabatha Fajardo, Jay Ram and Kyra Varnavas give their take on the development of AI in the classroom on 'The Story.' Artificial intelligence experts have advised consumers to use caution and trust their instincts when encountering ""hallucinations"" from artificial intelligence chatbots. ""The number-one piece is common sense,"" Kayle Gishen, chief technology officer of Florida-based tech company NeonFlux, told Fox News Digital. People should verify what they see, read or find on platforms such as ChatGPT through ""established sources of information,"" he said. MISINFORMATION MACHINES? AI CHATBOT ‘HALLUCINATIONS’ COULD POSE POLITICAL, INTELLECTUAL, INSTITUTIONAL DANGERS AI is prone to making mistakes — ""hallucinations"" in tech terminology — just like human sources. The word ""hallucinations"" refers to AI outputs ""that are coherent but factually incorrect or nonsensical,"" said Alexander Hollingsworth of Oyova, an app developer and marketing agency in Florida. Millions of music fans around the world were duped this week by a new song purporting to performed by Drake, left, and The Weeknd. It was actually an AI-generated deepfake.  (Getty Images) Images, data or information can look and sound highly credible, authentic and manmade. But it may actually be fake or inaccurate. Hallucinations are accidental — a chatbot simply doesn’t have the correct data, algorithm or information or is learning more about a topic, much as any human would. They're an honest mistake, in other words. ""Hallucinations … are coherent but factually incorrect or nonsensical."" — Alexander Hollingsworth, tech expert But AI can pose other dangers, such as ""deepfake"" videos and images, which appear real but are generated by artificial intelligence. AI-GENERATED SONG USING DRAKE AND THE WEEKND VOCALS GOES VIRAL, RAISING LEGAL CONCERNS Pop stars Drake and The Weeknd made headlines in recent days with the release of the new digital hit ""Heart on My Sleeve."" It racked up tens of millions of views on social media within days. Only one problem: it was a deepfake, generated by a TikTok user with an artificial intelligence program. Music platforms quickly pulled the song — but not before music fans around the world were fooled. Journalists watch an introductory video by the ""artificial intelligence"" anchor Fedha on the Twitter account of Kuwait News service, in Kuwait City on April 9, 2023. (YASSER AL-ZAYYAT/AFP via Getty Images) When it comes to accidental hallucinations — mistakes made by chatbots — researchers are working to counter the problem. ""Researchers employ a mix of techniques (to detect hallucinations) including input conditioning, rule-based filters, external knowledge sources, and human-in-the-loop evaluation,"" said Hollingsworth. ""The only robust way to identify chatbot hallucinations is auditing of the AI output by humans."" — Sean O’Brien ""Companies and research institutions are constantly refining these techniques to minimize the occurrence of hallucinations and improve AI-generated content quality."" But consumers are at the front lines of combating hallucinations, experts say. Individuals need to judge the validity of AI-generated content and information, just as they would any other. AI CHATBOT ‘HALLUCINATIONS’ PERPETUATE POLITICAL FALSEHOODS, BIASES THAT HAVE REWRITTEN AMERICAN HISTORY ""The only robust way to identify chatbot hallucinations is auditing of the AI output by humans,"" Sean O’Brien of the Yale Law School Privacy Lab told Fox News Digital. ""This increases cost and effort and reduces the promised benefits of AI chatbots in the first place. That's especially true if you train human auditors well and give them the research tools they need to discern fact from fiction."" Said Copy.AI co-founder Chris Lu, ""Detecting chatbot hallucinations typically involves monitoring the AI's output for inconsistencies or irrelevant information."" He added, ""This can be done through a combination of human oversight and automated systems that analyze the generated content. Companies including ours are investing in research and development to improve AI models, making them more robust and less prone to hallucinations."" Deepfakes, especially video, do leave signatures of manipulation that make them possible to detect even with the eye test, said New York-based Victoria Mendoza, CEO of MediaPeanut. These clues include inconsistencies in audio and video content, odd facial expressions and any quirks or anomalies that seem out of place. Consumers need to be wary of misinformation from AI chatbots, just as they would any other information source, say experts.  (Getty images) ""Detecting chatbot hallucinations involves monitoring the responses of the chatbot and comparing them to the expected responses,"" Mendoza said. ""This can be done by analyzing the chatbot’s training data, looking for patterns or inconsistencies in its responses, and using machine learning algorithms to detect any anomalies."" TUCKER CARLSON: IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DANGEROUS TO HUMANITY? Artificial intelligence itself is and will be used to help spot material that’s inauthentic or manipulated. ""Though deepfakes are often jarring and shocking in their realism, software is able to detect deepfakes easily due to anomalies in the image and video files,"" O’Brien said. ""Deepfakes leave evidence of their manipulation of the original video footage that social media platforms and apps could reasonably scan for. This would allow for flagging of deepfakes, as well as moderation and removal."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""At the end of the day … you shouldn’t be using technology as a crutch.

"LAURA INGRAHAM: Democrats want to keep young people weak, poor, frightened and alone","Fox News host Laura Ingraham lays out how Democrats are trying to ‘scare’ young people about the future on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ Fox News host Laura Ingraham shares what kind of life Democrats want for young people on ""The Ingraham Angle."" LAURA INGRAHAM: The Democrats are determined to keep young people weak, poor, frightened and alone. They don't want you to get married. They don't want you to go out to work. They don't want you to have kids. They want you at home smoking pot, playing video games and spending the rest of your life as a 12-year-old. We all know stories of young people who don't want to grow up, but I really don't believe that most young Americans want to spend the rest of their lives feeling sorry for themselves. They want to grow up. They want responsibility, and they want better lives for themselves and someday, yes, for their children. So here at ""The Angle,"" our motto is ""No American Left Behind,"" and that includes young Americans. We have to help them overcome that despair that the Democrats are selling. If you grew up in the 1970s, you know what it's like to be young in a world where the president is a hapless guy, where the enemies of America are on the march, and even the adults seem to have given up on the country. That time was scary and it was discouraging — and I remember it. LEFT RIPPED FOR PUSHING NIGHTMARISH CLIMATE NARRATIVE ON CHILDREN: ‘APOCALYPTIC POISONING’ And for young people in the '80s, President Reagan was a breath of fresh air. He believed that we could all do better, and we still can. Most of the so-called problems the Democrats are talking about — the end of the planet, threats to democracy and all the like — they're simply made up. And the real problems we face — a weak economy, a rising China, open borders — can all be addressed with the right policies. We've seen it before, just a few years ago.

""He said, ‘When you're in the air you [get to] see which things are small and which things are big,’"" she continued. ""And people forget, Howard was a great hero too. Maybe I love heroes because he was the first man to ever fly around the world. They talk so much about [Charles] Lindbergh, but he only flew the Atlantic. Howard flew around the world."" ""In the beginning, I had no feelings for him,"" Moore shared. ""But as time went on, I fell madly in love with him. In fact, Howard was the love of my life.

Russell Crowe almost quit 'Gladiator' because the script was 'absolute rubbish',"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Can you imagine the iconic drama ""Gladiator"" without Russell Crowe? It was in the realm of possibility, according to Crowe himself, who admitted he almost left the project for a multitude of reasons. ""‘Gladiator's' my 20-something movie. I was confident about my abilities as a leading man. What I wasn’t confident about with ‘Gladiator’ was the world that was surrounding me,"" he told Vanity Fair. ""At the core of what we were doing was a great concept, but the script, it was rubbish. Absolute rubbish. And it had all these sort of strange sequences, you know. One of them, was about chariots,"" he shared. While all the storylines were factual, Crowe worried that nothing would resonate with viewers. ""It's just not gonna ring right to a modern audience. They're gonna go, ‘What the f--- is all this?’"" Russel Crowe played Maximus in the 1999 film ""Gladiator."" (Universal) ‘GLADIATOR’ STAR RUSSELL CROWE REVEALS HE'S 'JEALOUS' OVER SEQUEL ""The energy around what we were doing was very fractured,"" he said of the film set. ""I did think a couple of times, ‘Maybe my best option is just to get on a plane and get out of here.'"" Conversations Crowe had with the film's director, Ridley Scott, contributed to the actor's decision to stay. Crowe recalled Scott telling him, ""Mate, we're not committing anything to camera that you don't believe in 100%."" ""When we actually started that film, we had 21 pages of script that we agreed on,"" Crowe shared. ""So we had a long way to go, and you know we basically used up those pages in the first section of the movie, so by the time we got to our second location, which was Morocco, we were sort of catching up."" Russell Crowe shared that he believed the original script for ""Gladiator"" was ""absolute rubbish."" (Universal) Although Crowe was in his mid-30s and relatively established at the time of filming, he resonated with co-star Joaquin Phoenix, who was just 26. ""Joaquin was going through the same thing that I was,"" Crowe recalled. ""When you walk onto a set that big, it's very easy for imposter-syndrome to come over you. It's like ‘What am I gonna do with this?’ And we'd go to his costume appointments and they'd put him in this armor and all this finery, you know. I remember one day he said to Ridley, ‘Ridley, I don’t understand. You know, I'm a kid from Florida, what am I supposed to do in this? Go out and wave to people?' And Ridley's like ‘Yeah. That’s what you're supposed to do.'"" Joaquin Phoenix played Commodus in ""Gladiator."" He was in his mid-20s when they filmed the movie. (Universal) CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Phoenix is now a critically acclaimed actor, but at the time, Crowe says only Scott knew of his talent. ""We all know this now. We know how fine an actor he is now. But back then, it was only Ridley Scott who knew how fine an actor he was. He was the one convincing Joaquin to do this, and to do it the way he did it, you know. The subtleties and the menace, and all of these things he brought to that role,"" he shared of his co-star. ""When I first saw it, I was blown away by it. When I first saw it with a crowd, that's when it really freaked me out because it was like going to a movie when I was a kid. People were so connected to the film, and they were voicing that connection."" Russell Crowe praised Joaquin Phoenix for his acting skills in the film. (Lucy Nicholson/AFP) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Crowe admitted that despite all the success he has received from the film, he is actually somewhat embarrassed by it. ""It's an incredible ensemble cast, with beautiful performances from end to end, not only Joaquin, but Connie Nielson, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Tomas Arana, Djimon Hounsou, I mean come on, man. It's just beautiful stuff,"" he said. ""I wish that every young actor could have a something like a ‘Gladiator' in their career. We made that film in 1999, and I'll bet you money somewhere in the world tonight, that film is playing on primetime television. It has the longest legs and people, you know they're not just connected to it, but they love it with a passion."" Caroline Thayer is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

Authorities were dispatched to Margera's home in Pocopson Township in Chester County for a reported ""domestic-in progress"" call at around 8 a.m. Bam, whose full name is Brandon Margera, allegedly punched his brother, Jesse, in the face. Upon arrival of law enforcement, Margera ""fled the residence on foot to the rear of the property through a dense wooded area,"" according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

Bam claimed that producers were not compensating him and attempted to steal the ""lucrative franchise"" without his approval. Margera allegedly signed a contract with Paramount that stipulated a ""wellness agreement,"" something Bam claimed he had been ""coerced"" into signing while he was in rehab recovering from addiction struggles in 2019. Bam had been fired from the fourth installment of the ""Jackass"" film in August 2020 after failing a drug test for Adderall. Under the agreement, he was required to submit to daily drug screenings. Bam Margera found fame with the ""Jackass"" crew, a group of amateur stuntmen who were known for filming their wild antics. (Frank Micelotta Archive) ""While Margera has given Jackass—quite literally—more than two decades worth of his blood, sweat and tears, Defendants have not repaid him in kind,"" the filing said. ""Rather, Margera, who has a documented history of physical and mental health issues, including diagnosed bipolar disorder, has been the victim of unconscionable discrimination at the hands of Defendants."" In 2018, Margera was arrested and charged with DUI and headed to rehab. He appeared on ""Dr. Phil"" in 2019 and checked back into rehab soon after. The lawsuit claims the named parties fired Margera after he tested positive for the prescribed substance despite his position that he had been taking Adderall by prescription for 10 years. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER ""Paramount’s inhumane treatment of Margera cannot be countenanced,"" the suit states. ""Margera was made to endure psychological torture in the form of a sham Wellness Agreement, and then ultimately terminated for his protected class status due to his medical condition, and his complaints about Defendants’ discriminatory conduct towards him."" In a press release announcing the filing of the lawsuit, Margera said, ""I am pissed-off, angry, hurt and shattered that Johnny [Knoxville], Jeff [Tremaine], Spike [Jonze] and the studios and producers ripped off my creativity, content, and stunts to make this movie, fired me without justification, and refuse to pay for my work; I created this franchise before any of these guys ever got involved."" He continued, ""My lawsuit isn’t just about compensation. It’s about treating people with mental health and addiction issues in an honest manner and not taking advantage of their disabilities to rip them off."" Tremaine filed a restraining order against Bam shortly after for ""civil harassment prevention."" By April 2022, Bam filed for the lawsuit to be ""dismissed with prejudice"" in a Los Angeles Superior Court. He cannot file the suit again.

U2 creates new immersive concert experience at Las Vegas venue,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. U2 is familiar with rocking out in major sporting arenas and stadiums, but the legendary band will soon hit the stage to create a new immersive concert experience inside a high-tech, globe-shaped venue in Las Vegas. Live Nation and Sphere Entertainment announced Monday the dates for U2’s upcoming ""U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At Sphere"" shows starting Sept. 29. The rock band’s special five-night run of shows will be held until Oct. 8 at The Venetian’s Sphere with a state-of-the-art audio and visual system designed for each concertgoer. ""This is a venue designed for entertainment, not sports,"" said U2 guitarist The Edge in a recent interview. He first learned about the cutting-edge venue after lead singer Bono sent him a link about the concept. He said the screen is 20 times bigger than the one during the band’s Joshua Tree tour in 2019 — the last time U2 performed live in a concert setting. JAMIE FOXX IS 'HEALING' AFTER SUFFERING 'MEDICAL COMPLICATION': REPORT ""Sports is a simple formula. You want to see the action,"" he continued. ""But no one really sits down when they’re designing one of these sports arenas and thinks about sound. That’s way, way down on their list of priorities. But in this venue, it’s one of the first things they thought about."" The massive spherical venue will have 17,500 seats with a scalable capacity of nearly 20,000 guests. Along with high resolution LED screens that wrap halfway around the audience, the venue is also equipped with thousands of speakers that will deliver a ""crystal-clear"" multi-layered audio system for every seat inside. U2 perform during a concert at the Apollo Theater on June 11, 2018, in New York. ""U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At Sphere"" will be held at The Venetian’s MSG Sphere. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) As a musician, The Edge said the venue’s concept is an ""amazing thought"" in helping performers like U2 capture the full essence of their sound. He said their shows will offer an opportunity to ""literally transport people to some other space and time"" and open a variety of ""creative possibilities."" ""What we’re able to do — because of the design and the fidelity of the sound — is introduce not just the best sounding rock ‘n’ roll band of all time in an indoor venue,"" he said. ""But also, radical intimacy where you can actually deliver a vocal or a simple music arrangement that’s really delicate. The people will be able to hear perfectly. Whereas if you’re trying that in an arena or a stadium, it would just be impossible."" WHY IS MORGAN WALLEN SO FAMOUS? A LOOK AT HOW THE COUNTRY STAR GOT HIS START ON ‘THE VOICE’ During the band’s rehearsals, The Edge has already seen a significant difference from the sphere venue compared to an arena or stadium — which normally ""imposes on your sound."" He said their music preparations haven’t changed much, but they are starting to try to understand how to use the immersive sound as a creative tool. The Edge believes the band’s performances at Sphere could be a ""quantum leap forward"" in terms of the sensory impacts of a live concert. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""It’s technology that has never been available,"" he said. ""We can literally in sonic terms, but also in visual terms, have our audience not kind of be looking at the show, but be in the middle of the show and in the middle of the sound. It’s sound all around you. … I’m already starting to think about the mixes and our songs and think about how this spatial audio could come into its own in terms of just where we place different parts of our sound."" The Edge said U2 is pumped to return to the stage for the first time in four years, especially after the pandemic. The band’s upcoming show will mark the first time performing without drummer Larry Mullen Jr., who is recovery from back surgery. In Mullen's absence, Bram van den Berg will fill in as drummer. ""We’re so excited,"" he said. ""We’ve been on lockdown. I’ve been in the recording studio for the last 18 months doing the acoustic collection, ‘Songs of Surrender.’ I can’t wait to get out there and be a part of something huge like this.""

Meghan Markle skipping coronation 'a quiet relief' for royals eager to avoid 'The Meghan Show': expert,"True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen reveals why its best for the British royal family that the Duchess of Sussex will stay behind in Montecito during King Charles coronation with her son Prince Archie and daughter Princess Lilibet. The British royal family is said to be taking a collective sigh of relief over Meghan Markle being a no-show for King Charles’ big day. On April 12, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Prince Harry will attend his father’s coronation, ending months of speculation about whether the Duke of Sussex would be welcome after writing his explosive memoir ""Spare."" His wife will remain at the couple’s California home with their two young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. ""I think there is a quiet relief that Meghan isn’t coming because it avoids so many situations,"" True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen told Fox News Digital. ""It avoids all cameras being trained on Meghan when it’s the king’s day. People would be waiting to see what their reactions are. Do people give side eye to each other in the front row? I think the fact that she isn’t coming is a good thing. The fact that [Prince Harry] is coming is a good thing."" Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Meghan Markle won't accompany her husband Prince Harry to King Charles' coronation. (Andrew Milligan - WPA Pool/Getty Images) Bullen is an award-winning documentarian who has been producing programs about the British royal family for 20 years. He has also worked closely with the king for about a decade. On April 21, the streaming platform will premiere ""His Majesty’s Coronation: Behind the Throne,"" a special featuring a panel of royal experts and insiders who will dig deep into the traditions associated with the coronation. The king will be crowned on May 6 at London’s Westminster Abbey. According to Bullen, sources told him that ""everyone is really pleased that Harry’s coming to the coronation."" KING CHARLES MAKES SURPRISING GESTURE TOWARD MEGHAN MARKLE IN OFFICIAL CORONATION PROGRAM True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen told Fox News Digital that despite tensions, the British royal family is pleased that Prince Harry will attend his father's coronation in May. (Victoria Jones - WPA Pool/Getty Images) ""He had to come,"" Bullen explained. ""This is his father’s biggest moment. It’s what his father waited his whole life for. It would’ve been just rude not to turn up, let alone lacking in dignity and style… The royal family, the household, the nation – [everyone] is really pleased he’s coming. He had to be a part of it."" The date of the coronation coincides with Archie’s birthday, giving the former American actress an excuse to stay behind in the States. Bullen said that following the six-part Netflix docuseries detailing the couple’s decision to quit royal duties, the 41-year-old made the right decision to skip the celebrations. Harry and the former ""Suits"" star, who is biracial, have alleged she faced racist attitudes from both the palace and the U.K. press. The treatment contributed to their decision to leave the country. Meghan Markle, an American actress, became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Prince Harry in 2018. (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) The revelations in ""Spare″ include details of private conversations between Harry and his father, as well as with his brother Prince William. The bestselling book fanned tensions between Harry and his family that became public when he and his wife moved to North America in 2020. The book also included allegations that members of the royal family regularly feed the press unflattering information about other members of the House of Windsor in exchange for positive coverage of themselves. Following the publication of ""Spare,"" the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed that they were asked to vacate their home in Britain. Frogmore Cottage, a royal residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle, was the couple’s main residence before they gave up royal duties and moved to the wealthy, coastal city of Montecito. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently confirmed that they were asked to vacate their U.K. home. According to reports, King Charles launched the eviction process a day after Prince Harry's explosive memoir ""Spare"" was published. (Matt Dunham - WPA Pool/Getty Images) Bullen said Markle’s appearance would have only fueled the ongoing royal soap opera. ""It’s definitely better that Harry’s flying solo because it avoids any awkward moments with family members,"" Bullen explained. ""It’s going to be tough enough. I don’t think [Prince] William and Harry will have any meaningful conversations. Harry’s made it pretty clear he intends to fly in and fly out and wants to be back that day for Archie’s birthday. So the opportunities for them to speak to each other will be very minimal. I don’t think Harry’s part of the procession. He’s unlikely to be on the balcony, so there’s going to be very little interaction. They’ll travel in different vehicles. So there are not many moments where they need to come together."" Prince William's relationship with his younger brother Prince Harry continues to be at an all-time low, Nick Bullen claimed. (Karwai Tang/WireImage) ""But I think Meghan not coming makes it easier for everybody because it doesn’t become ‘The Meghan Show,’"" Bullen continued. ""And even if Meghan didn’t want it to be ‘The Meghan Show,’ she’s bright enough to realize that if she turns up, cameras will be trained on her to see how she’s reacting. Cameras will be trained on Kate [Middleton] to see how she’s looking at Meghan. How does Queen [Camilla] look at Meghan? Do the king and Meghan have any conversations? It all becomes about what happened with Meghan. So I think it’s a good thing she’s not coming."" PRINCE WILLIAM EXPECTED TO 'TOLERATE' PRINCE HARRY DURING CORONATION, EXPERT CLAIMS: 'BAD BLOOD AND BETRAYAL' All eyes were on Meghan Markle when she attended Queen Elizabeth II's funeral in the U.K. (Patrick van Katwijk/Getty Images) Bullen said he isn’t surprised that Markle decided not to join her husband. He said that if ""Meghan had been in the room, it would’ve been more difficult for everybody."" Royal watchers would have focused on how Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle interacted with each other during the coronation. (Richard Pohle - WPA Pool/Getty Images) Still, he said, there’s a sense of ""sadness"" that the Duchess of Sussex won’t be there to support her father-in-law. It was Charles, he pointed out, who walked Markle down the aisle on her wedding day in 2018 when her father, former Hollywood lighting director Thomas Markle, couldn’t attend. ""If you look back to Harry and Meghan’s wedding, there was so much goodwill for them,"" said Bullen. ""There was so much that they could have done for the monarchy. This would’ve been another moment that allowed us to see how good they could have been. I think it’s sad for everybody – for them, for the family, for the nation, for the Commonwealth. It’s sad that opportunity has been lost, and it will never be regained."" PRINCE HARRY TO ATTEND KING CHARLES' CORONATION WITHOUT MEGHAN MARKLE, PALACE CONFIRMS Prince Harry is seen here looking at his bride, Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the former Prince Charles on the couple's wedding day. (Jonathan Brady/Pool/AFP/Getty Images) ""I think there will be a sadness on everybody’s part, but at the same time, there’ll be relief that the story isn’t about her,"" Bullen continued. ""… Lots of people hold her, and Harry, responsible for this family breakdown. They’ve taken a position that has been very difficult for them to come back from. And it’s been very difficult for the Windsors to step into. I know for a fact that the king and Harry have spoken. And I know for a fact that the king has done whatever he can to try and facilitate the rebuilding of a relationship. But the Sussexes have made their bed, and they’re lying in it very clearly."" Bullen continues to be hopeful that in time, Harry will mend his relationship with the king. Sources told him that the 74-year-old and his younger son, 38, have had positive conversations. And while the king was said to be deeply hurt by Harry’s claims in his memoir, he’s ""pleased"" that the prince will attend the coronation, even if the visit is brief. And Markle, suspecting the kind of backlash she may receive by the British press for her appearance, thought better of it. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made their royal exit in 2020. (Samir Hussein/WireImage) There is plenty of hurt to go around, said Bullen. However, the ongoing saga won’t end when the king is crowned. ""For years, we’ve been obsessed with big, powerful families,"" Bullen explained. ""Whether it’s ‘Dallas,’ ‘Dynasty,’ ‘Succession,’ ‘Yellowstone’ – all those great shows have successful, powerful families at the heart of them. And this is what this is… And it’s real life. It’s better than anything you’re going to get in fiction."" The Associated Press contributed to this report. Stephanie Nolasco covers entertainment at Foxnews.com. ",1510,ENTERTAINMENT,
Granger Smith feels 'relief' leaving country music to 'serve' God: 'I need to completely surrender',"The ""Happens Like That"" singer has written a new memoir being published this summer titled ""Like a River: Finding the Faith and Strength to Move Forward after Loss and Heartache."" Granger Smith is walking away from his successful country music career – and he's relieved. Earlier this month, the singer/songwriter took to his social media pages and announced that his upcoming ""Like a River"" tour, named after his son, would be his last. The 43-year-old is gearing up to devote his life to ministry at his local church outside of Austin, Texas. His final show is on Aug. 26. ""I have a huge feeling of relief now that … I’ve been able to tell the world exactly what my intentions are and what I’m going to do,"" the ""Happens Like That"" artist told Fox News Digital. ""For the last few years, a handful of people had known that [I was] probably leaving country music. [And] it’s difficult to get on stage in different environments, in different cities and play music for people knowing, as I’m looking into their eyes, that I’m probably going to tell them in a few months that I’m not doing this anymore. That’s a difficult way to live. And so, there’s a big sense of relief now that I’ve told everyone."" Granger Smith's tour comes to an end on Aug. 26. (Randy Holmes/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images) The star admitted that for a while, he yearned for a new sense of purpose. Eager to devote himself to his faith, Smith is currently working toward a master’s degree from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. While some in Smith’s circle encouraged him to share his faith through song, Smith felt it wasn’t enough. ""I wrestled with the idea for a long time that this doesn’t feel right,"" Smith admitted. ""A lot of people will probably think, ‘Why don’t you just sing country music, but talk about God on the stage?’ Or, ‘Why don’t you sing a couple of hymns on the stage? And that fixes everything.’ I wrestled with that for a couple of years.… A lot of pastors and preachers told me, ‘Country music is your ministry, brother. You’re in a dark world. You’re bringing light to a dark world. You’re going into bars and stages where people might not have heard the message of Christ, and you get to speak it – that is your ministry.’"" ""I believed it,"" he continued. ""And part of me still does believe that. But here’s the deal – it wasn’t ever about that. It wasn’t ever about finding the best platform to tell people about Christ. The first thing that needed to happen was I needed to make myself smaller because I was exalting myself on the stage. I was glorifying myself. I was seeking praise from people. And by doing that, it doesn’t matter if I was proclaiming Christ, because I was doing it the wrong way. I was proclaiming Christ from a self-exalting platform. And that was the contradiction I finally had to come to terms with. I might have a stage down the road, but right now I need to completely surrender that and give it over to God."" COUNTRY MUSIC STAR GRANGER SMITH LEAVING INDUSTRY FOR MINISTRY: 'I JUST WANT TO GLORIFY GOD' After touring, Granger Smith is going to focus on ministry at his local church outside of Austin, Texas. (Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Stagecoach) Smith said he’s eager to be an active member of his church, one that would allow him to give back to his local community and connect with those who are feeling lost in their lives. It’s a feeling he can easily identify with. Granger Smith's son River passed away in 2019 from a drowning accident at the family's Texas home. (Granger Smith) In 2019, Smith fell into a downward spiral when he lost his three-year-old child. The Smith family was outside their home when River slipped through their pool gate and went into the water. River was quickly pulled out of the pool, but he had been without oxygen for too long. Despite the efforts of doctors, he later died. River’s eldest siblings, Lincoln and London, witnessed the devastating accident.

""Trying to figure out how I was going to wake up in the morning and start a new day, knowing I have a dead son, is something that I failed at for months and months.… I tried everything. I tried the self-help books and I tried different forms of exercise, diets. Different edibles – anything. If you would’ve said, ‘Are you going through heartache? Are you going through extreme grief? Try this. I read about this, try it,’ I’d probably try it.… I was going to do anything so that I could be strong for my family. Nothing was working.""

The family shared it was important that Maverick receive formal swimming safety lessons. Smith said that immersing himself in his faith gave him a lifeline. ""Let’s look at it this way – when you have a 3- or 4-year-old child, they might be going through something really tough, like trying to tie their shoes,"" he explained. ""They’re getting frustrated… they’re hungry… They’re just going through this tough time of just tying their shoes and everything is going wrong. Then a parent comes in, picks them up, and says, ‘Stop fighting. I got you. I’ll get your shoes tied. I’ll get you to school. Just stop fighting.’ It’s that same feeling I had when I finally released myself and said, ‘God, I’m giving this all to you. Just take it.’ And then that fatherly feeling of Him just wrapping his arms around me and going, ‘I got you.’ That’s the feeling of relief that I had.""

He won’t miss sleeping on tour buses, he joked, but he’ll never forget the outpouring of support that has come from fans over the years. ""There’s a lot I’m going to miss in country music,"" he said. ""I’ve been doing it for a long time, for multiple decades, for a reason. It wasn’t because I was collecting a paycheck, because most of those years I wasn’t.

[But] they poo-pooed my idea, saying, ‘No, you can’t do that.’ And [they] had a sitcom they wanted me to do, to which I said, ‘I don’t want to be the same person every week. I want variety, I want music, I want different characters to do.’ They had to put us on the air because I had a 10-year contract… I just said, ‘This is what I know, and this is what I want to do.’ I wasn’t deterred at all. I just simply said, ‘I want to have fun.’ And I pushed for that. They had to put it on the air."" Carol Burnett was initially discouraged from launching a variety show. (John Springer Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) Burnett said that fellow comedienne Lucille Ball happily served as a mentor and even gave her a gig when she was out of work. The women developed a close friendship, one that lasted until the ""I Love Lucy"" star’s death in 1989 at age 77. ""She never tried to give me any advice,"" Burnett said.

""When we read the sketch, the writers had written that I would run up the stairs and then come back down with the draperies just hanging on me,"" Burnett explained. ""Bob Mackie, who’s so brilliant, thought, ‘Well, that’s not as funny as it could be.’ I went into the costume fitting that week, and he said, ‘I have an idea for the curtain dress.’ I walked into the fitting room, and he had it on this mannequin.

I knew it was going to get a crazy, wonderful response. I remember being right at the top of the stairs. And when I entered, it was like a cannon went off in the studio. The audience – everybody – was just hysterical. But I wasn’t surprised. I expected it. I knew it would be a hit. And it was all Bob’s thinking. He’s a genius.

Pat Boone's concern for America: ‘We’re going down the tubes morally',"Pat Boone says the country is ""going down the tubes morally in every way."" Pat Boone has some serious concerns about the state of morality in America. The singer and actor, who is celebrating his 70th year in show business, was one of the most famous teen idols of the 1950s and ‘60s. Known for his squeaky-clean image and devout Christian faith, Boone sold millions of records, starred in a string of family-friendly hit movies and helped pioneer the rock ’n' roll movement. He continues to act in films, serve as spokesperson for numerous brands and recently released a new single, ""Grits."" In an interview with Fox News Digital, Boone, 88, decried what he perceives as the deterioration of values in the country. ""We're going down the tubes morally in every way,"" the legendary performer said.

Because whether their parents forbid them to see it on TV, their friends' parents don't. And so they're seeing things they shouldn't be exposed to. ""They're being taught now in class that if they feel like they're the wrong gender, maybe they can change over if they want and without even telling their parents,"" Boone added. ""And the changing of American history."" Boone criticized the entertainment industry for making and celebrating ""immoral"" films, television shows and music.

And it's a steady diet of the worst. And the songs that are all about infidelity and getting drunk and drinking your troubles away. And that's been true in country music for a long time. There are attacks on our morality coming from every direction. And the thing is, some of the worst immoral things get the biggest rewards and awards."" Boone expressed his view that some of the content produced by Hollywood glorifies and normalizes criminal behavior, damaging the image of America worldwide. ""The American movie business used to be our greatest export to the world,"" he said. ""It used to tell people that America's a great place, and the stories all have happy endings and the bad guys get punished. And the good guys win.

You wanted them to win. And even big pop stars play criminals. And somehow, in some of those films, the criminals, you hate to see them get killed because you've gotten to sort of identify with them."" The singer referenced Adam Sandler, who received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center last month. While Boone said he ""loved"" Sandler, he wasn't a fan of the comedian's 2019 film ""Uncut Gems."" In the crime thriller, Sandler played a jeweler and gambling addict who makes an escalating series of bad decisions that threaten to destroy his family and his life.

"DNA ties Michigan businessman, 'avid golfer' to decades-old fairway rapes","CeCe Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon Nanolabs, shares the impact the latest technology could have in cracking the case of JonBenet Ramsey's 1996 murder. DNA on a coffee cup has linked a Michigan businessman to a pair of decades-old rapes on golf courses – including one on the Penn State University campus, authorities announced. Kurt Alan Rillema, 51, of West Bloomfield, is charged with sexually assaulting a woman at the Twin Lakes Golf Club in 1999 in Oakland Charter Township and a jogger on a Penn State University golf course in 2000.

"Rep. Tenney: Biden deserves 'less than zero' grade on handling COVID, responsible for 'devastated' economy","Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., discusses a record number of northern border encounters on 'Fox News Live.' Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., sharply criticized President Biden and his handling of the COVID pandemic Tuesday, saying during an interview with Fox News Digital that she would grade his leadership over the last three years as ""less than zero."" The Biden administration’s ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to lockdowns and vaccine mandates ruined peoples’ livelihoods, devastated the economy and did incalculable damage to constituents in her 24th Congressional District and others around the country, she said. ""It's about time,"" Tenney told Fox News Digital when asked about Biden formally ending the COVID national emergency, which he signed earlier this week. It had been in effect since March 2020. ""I have been calling for the end of the pandemic."" ""We focused on everybody with a one-sized fits all solution, which never works,"" the New Yorker told Fox News Digital. ""Instead of having a smart policy. We shut everybody down. We put our economy in peril. We hurt our communities, we lost livelihoods. They don't want to follow the science."" BIDEN 'NOT COMPETENT' TO BE PRESIDENT AFTER APPEARING TO ZONE OUT DURING MSNBC INTERVIEW: REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY Representative Claudia Tenney, a Republican from New York, scolded President Biden over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. (Ken Cedeno/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Tenney added: ""Joe Biden announced last year that the pandemic is over, so why continue with the mandates on vaccines? Why continue to put employers through difficult times and not be able to get people back to work? Students not being able to go to school or to enroll in classes?"" When asked whether the Biden administration was being honest with the American people, Tenney pointed to new information being revealed by Elon Musk, Matt Taibbi and others showing ""all of the ridiculous protocols and the falsities that have come out on COVID-19."" ""[They are] exposing the kind of ridiculous non-science, political reasons that the Biden administration and others have required this vaccine mandate or really had the lockdowns and put us in a position that we couldn't thrive,"" the Republican lawmaker said. ""Many people in many businesses have been hurt by these lockdowns and these closures and these vaccine mandates. People have lost their livelihoods."" ""They are not using science, and they're being exposed everywhere,"" she continued. ""Our own director of the CDC said that we've come to realize that the vaccines do not prevent the spread of this disease. So we're forcing everyone to be vaccinated, and it does nothing in deterring or stopping the spread of the disease. So why are we forcing healthy people to take the vaccine?"" President Biden kept the travel restrictions and vaccine mandates in place several months after other country resume pre-pandemic policies. (Julien Behal/Irish Government via Getty Images) People who were less susceptible to COVID and those ""less vulnerable"" should not have been forced to close their businesses, remain out of schools or surrender their livelihoods to haphazard restrictions, she contended. Tenney added: ""I'm talking about young people, college-age kids, teenagers, young children, athletes, that are elite athletes in the prime of their health, who have also maybe had COVID-19 and recovered. They completely disregarded the natural immunity."" REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY REACTS TO BIDEN APPEARING TO ZONE OUT DURING INTERVIEW: 'THIS IS SERIOUS' ""I think they've gotten comfortable with their control over the American people,"" the lawmaker speculated. Biden’s vaccine mandate and the policies of New York’s ""authoritarian"" Gov. Kathy Hochul continue to have an impact on those in her state, Tenney said. Nurses — ""who were heroes during the pandemic"" — are unable to assist in an ongoing nursing shortage because ""the Biden administration continued the vaccine mandate"" and Hochul ""would not let these people [who would not or could not get the vaccine] get back to work,"" she continued. ""And now, many of our rural hospitals in upstate New York are in peril,"" the Republican said. ""They're facing fiscal crises right now, where they may not even be allowed to stay open because of the loss of staff. The requirement to shut down entire wings of hospitals, not because, you know, they were over capacitated because they simply don't have the staff because the vaccine mandate and other rules put in place."" Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., is interviewed by CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images in her Longworth Building office on Tuesday, November 30, 2021.  (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) These policies are going to hurt these hospitals and others affected ""in the long run,"" she contented. ""We may not have enough hospital beds to even meet the needs of the people that need them now. And we could be in real crisis if we have another pandemic."" ""Finally, today, the president of the State University of New York system announced all 64 campuses now do not require the vaccine in order for students to attend college, which is great. This is one of the least vulnerable groups,"" Tenney said. Tenney has been vocal about her support for tennis star Novak Djokovic, who is ranked among the best in the world, as he was denied access to play in the United States last year due to the Biden administration’s vaccine mandates. ""I pleaded with Secretary Blinken and Joe Biden in the administration to let Djokovic play. Novak Djokovic had COVID-19 [and natural immunity]. He's extremely healthy. He's one of the healthiest people probably on the planet with his incredible record as a tennis player at his age. Even the USTA and other tennis organizations have urged that Djokovic should be allowed to play and be given a waiver,"" she explained. The Biden administration denied her request, but they allowed other members of the US Open to play without being vaccinated, so she believes their reasoning was not based on science but on politics. ""Ironically, Djokovic actually played in 2020 and 2021. Before we had a vaccine, so it's absurd,"" she said. ""This isn't science. It's politics, especially when it comes to Novak Djokovic because he doesn't hold the views that this administration holds politically. And so the last thing they're going to do is allow someone like Novak Djokovic, a waiver to come in. Regardless, I mean, sports should take us away from politics. And that's why I've been fighting so hard. This is symbolic of what's happened to Djokovic. And it's what we shouldn't be doing as a country."" Novak Djokovic of Serbia was denied access to play in the United States due to his vaccination status. (Clive Brunskill/Getty Images) Tenney told Fox News Digital that the last four years gave Americans an opportunity to see how the Trump administration initially tackled the COVID pandemic when the disease ""was very much an unknown."" ""There has been a lot of criticism of President Trump and his administration in this but [COVID] was very much an unknown. We couldn't get to the heart of what was happening,"" she said. ""China was covering up the issues, the World Health Organization was perpetuating lies and covering up the information. But now we find out that it is indeed a result of a lab leak."" PRESIDENT BIDEN TURNS HEADS WITH INSTAGRAM POST BRAGGING ABOUT INFLATION FALLING FROM ITS 'PEAK' Once COVID began spreading around the world, Trump took action to limit overseas flights. Biden did as well, but the New York Republican said Biden kept these travel restrictions in place long after they needed to be. The U.S. maintained COVID-travel limits for months after other country resumed their pre-pandemic travel policies. ""President Trump did put into place Operation Warp Speed to bring us a vaccine, though it was an experimental vaccine, it wasn't perfect. It wasn't mandated. And they encouraged people to take the vaccine,"" Tenney explained. ""But the mandates were really where the problem was. We didn't allow doctors to actually make a patient-client decision, making sure that they knew that the patient could or could not tolerate these vaccines, and what was the best course of treatment for them,"" she continued. Representative Claudia Tenney, a Republican from New York, applauded President Donald Trump's approach to the COVID pandemic as he provided information and federal assistance to states. (Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Tenney added: ""But instead, it was this government-knows-all, Joe Biden-knows-all. His administration, based on politics, shut everybody down."" While the Trump administration allowed states to dictate their own approach to the pandemic, the Biden administration ""shamed and shunned everyone who questioned"" how they governed. ""So I give Biden less than an F. And I give President Trump, you know, a decent score for at least trying to figure out what was happening. Vice President Pence issued guidelines to the states. They weren't mandates,"" the legislator continued. Passengers stand in line for a Frontier Airlines flight at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma, New York, on February 22, 2023.  (Steve Pfost/Newsday RM via Getty Images) While not providing a grade for her own New York leadership, Tenney stressed many actions of the governor exacerbated problems in the state. ""These things were very poorly handled by then-Governor Cuomo in the state of New York, which is why we had so many problems, administering the vaccine, getting solutions out of our state. Our supply chains were a disaster, which is why we couldn't get personal protective gear to people. All this stuff did not happen because of policies that were put in place,"" the lawmaker said. The Republican lawmaker recalled Biden’s last three years in office as a ""complete disaster"" and said she initially guessed he would have needed ""four years or potentially eight"" years to make the impact he has already made. AS PRESIDENT BIDEN CONSIDERS 2024 RUN, AMERICANS WEIGH IN ON WHETHER HE SHOULD But, Tenney said, Biden has ""nearly destroyed and erased all the gains that we made in the four years under President Trump."" ""We see our economy is in free fall. It's a disaster,"" she explained. ""Our international politics is a disaster, whether it's the debacle that happened in Afghanistan that undermine our credibility [and] left 13 dead service members. [We're] setting up weakness on energy. We are now no longer energy independent. We now are dependent on Venezuela [and] Saudi Arabia."" Tenney’s son is a Marine, so the death of 11 Marine Corps servicemembers was ""particularly devastating"" for her and other Marine Corps families. ""All of our service members are precious,"" she said. ""The sacrifices they make and their families make was completely disregarded by Joe Biden. He said he had no regrets. I mean, these are absurd lies to the American people."" She also said the Biden administration was continuing to try to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, the world's leading sponsor of terrorism. President Biden pauses while he speaks about the situation in Afghanistan in the East Room of the White House on August 26, 2021, in Washington, DC. At least 13 American service members were killed by suicide bomb attacks near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan.  (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Biden has also ""been unable to deter what happens between Putin, who is ruthlessly killing and murdering people in Ukraine, and the Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their survival,"" Tenney said. She continued: ""They're not getting assurances from Joe Biden and not getting the kind of support they need. The American people need a plan. What are we doing in Ukraine? Why are we spending so much of American money and not knowing what the plan is?"" Biden’s foreign policy has been ""chaos,"" she said, and current geo-political crises are so bad that ""the Chinese are intervening."" ""Our allies, Saudi Arabia, even Macron of France, are turning to the Chinese Communist Party,"" she added. ""This is a disaster."" As for moving on from Biden in 2024, Tenney said the American people ""need leadership now."" ""They don't need a bumbling old man who is incompetent, who has always been incompetent on foreign policy and every other issue [and] who is corrupt,"" she said, mentioning the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, and potential business connections through his son in Ukraine and China. Potential voters in 2024 are ""looking for the kind of America first policies that President Trump brought,"" Tenney claimed. ""I think people are looking for strong leadership, competent leadership."" ""They're looking for decisive action, they're looking for a leader who will stand up to our enemies stand up to China, rebuild our economy, because the most important defense that we have as a nation is a strong economy,"" she continued, because ""when the United States is strong and when we're vibrant on the economy, the world is more peaceful.""

Georgia Power bills likely to rise by 12% in June,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. State regulatory staff and Georgia Power Co. have agreed on a plan that will boost power bills by 12% in June to cover the higher costs of natural gas and coal that the utility burns to generate electricity for its 2.7 million customers. The unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. filed new figures Monday saying it needs to collect an additional $6.6 billion from customers over the next three years, under an agreement it reached with Georgia Public Service Commission staff earlier this month. Because of declining natural gas price forecasts, that's actually $1.1 billion less than Georgia Power had earlier projected. But it will boost a typical residential bill to $147.50 a month, up $15.90 from the current $131.60. The increase had originally been predicted to be as high as $23. The five-member elected commission is scheduled to vote on fuel charges on May 16. Any final plan is likely to closely track the agreement between the company and the staff. Bill increases are stacking up for Georgia Power customers. Rates went up 2.5% last month in January after commissioners approved a three-year rate plan in December. Increases of 4.5% will follow in 2024 and 2025. Customers will also have to pay the costs of the third and fourth nuclear units at Plant Vogtle near Augusta. Unit 3 is projected to begin operation in May or June, leading to a roughly $4 a month increase for residential customers. A larger rate increase is likely to follow when Unit 4 begins operations, now projected before March 2024. GEORGIA BOY, 13, CHARGED IN EASTER SUNDAY MURDER OF MAN SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES Typically, a utility is allowed to charge customers for the cost of fuel, but isn’t allowed to make a profit on those charges, unlike the profits Georgia Power is guaranteed for investing in power plants and transmission lines. The all-Republican commission typically decides how much Georgia Power can collect for fuel once every two years. In the meantime, if prices change, the company may collect too much or too little. During this two-year period, even though commissioners approved a 15% boost in fuel costs that began in January 2022, the company collected far too little money. Natural gas prices skyrocketed because of an improving economy and the Ukraine war, and coal prices rose even more steeply in part because of supply and labor shortages. Georgia Power Co. and state regulatory staff agreed on a plan that will likely rise power bills by 12% in June. Georgia Power says it will end the period roughly $4.5 billion in the hole for fuel already burned. Most of the proposed rate increase will make up for that deficit, repaying the company over three years instead of the normal two because the debt is so large. The utility says it forecasts it also needs another $2.2 billion to make up for higher fuel prices going forward. Georgia Power and commission staff have agreed to let the company make larger changes to cover cost swings between fuel-cost rate cases. The agreement would let Georgia Power raise or lower fuel charges by as much as 40% in the interim, instead of the current 15%. Because of unrecovered debt, that ability would likely only be used to further raise customer bills in the next two years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The company and staff also agreed to raise a fuel cost discount for low-income senior citizens from $6 a month now to $8 a month. The Georgia Association of Manufacturers argues commissioners should stretch repayment of the deficit out over five years to reduce rate increases. Georgia Power said Monday it opposes a longer payback period. Environmentalists argue that commissioners should force Georgia Power to bear some rising fuel costs because it has shifted its generation portfolio to depend on natural gas, whose price is volatile. The company argues the commission has already approved the current generation mix as the most economical and reliable option. ",674,WORLD NEWS,us

Indiana GOP slashes proposed public health funding by $125M,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Republican legislators are poised to direct only about two-thirds of the money that Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb sought toward tackling the state’s poor national rankings in areas such as obesity, smoking and life expectancy and improving local emergency services. Budget plans endorsed by House and Senate members would make up to $225 million available for counties taking the optional step of expanding public health programs over the next two years. While that is a major boost from the current $7 million in year in state funding, Holcomb requested nearly $350 million from the new state budget that the Republican-dominated Legislature will vote on later this week. Republican former state Sen. Luke Kenley, who was co-chairman of a Holcomb-appointed commission on public health, said Monday that he still hoped lawmakers would approve about $15 million in additional specific funding aimed toward training and equipment for emergency medical service providers in rural counties. Kenley said he knew it was a ""big ask"" to get such a large increase for public health spending. INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB'S PUBLIC HEALTH EXPANSION PASSES LEGISLATIVE PANEL ""It’s enough to get us going on a pretty big project,"" Kenley said. House and Senate negotiators continued working behind closed doors Monday on a budget deal after an updated tax revenue report released last week showed the state is projected to collect about $1.5 billion, or 2.5%, more than previously expected through July 2025. Those projections, however, were unlikely to mean more money for the public health expansion that has faced hesitancy among the Legislature’s most conservative members and some opposition among voters with grievances over government-ordered COVID-19 precautions who said they feared creeping state authority over local health agencies. Republican Indiana Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ryan Mishler noted last week several issues fellow party members may raise with Republican Gov. Eric Holcombs $350 million public health spending proposal. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings, file) ""That’s more than just the funding,"" Republican Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ryan Mishler of Mishawaka said last week. ""I think you have a lot of members that just have some issues with the (expansion) itself. So that’ll be a tougher one, probably, to increase the funding."" Republican House Speaker Todd Huston called the $225 million included in the budget proposals ""an historic investment"" and said it would likely remain near that level in the final budget deal. Holcomb’s original budget request would have directed $300 million over the next two years toward boosting Indiana’s county public health department funding from its current 45th national ranking. Those county health departments are now primarily funded by local taxes. SEN. MIKE BRAUN REVEALS 2024 PICK FOR GOP NOMINATION: 'IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT' The governor’s public health commission had sought a $240 million annual boost to lift funding for county public health departments to the national average, but Holcomb said time was needed to ""build the structure"" for expanded health programs. Holcomb made the public health expansion one of his top priorities for the new state budget, saying during his State of the State speech in January that Indiana’s poor health rankings were ""a pattern we need to reverse."" The governor’s office declined to specifically comment on the negotiations over the public health spending increase. House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta of Fort Wayne said the Legislature should seize the chance to expand those programs as the tax revenue forecast shows that the money is available.

"Americans spent more on legal cannabis in 2022 than chocolate, beer: report","Actor and comedian Cheech Marin shares why he launched his own cannabis company with longtime friend Tommy Chong and curated an exhibit of Chicano art on 'Kennedy.' U.S. residents are spending more money to purchase legal cannabis than they are on chocolate, craft beer and topical pain relief. A report from MJBizDaily showed Americans spent roughly $30 billion on legal marijuana in 2022 while only spending around $20 billion on chocolate. The cannabis purchases eclipsed sales of ""feel-good"" products, including beer, opioid medications and topical pain relief, the report stated.

During his ""My Take,"" Monday ""Varney & Co."" host Stuart Varney discussed the consequences of Democrats covering up the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, arguing the president's ""successful dirty trick"" helped win him the election, but put the United States in a ""disastrous"" foreign policy position. STUART VARNEY: It's October 2020, right before the monumental Trump versus Biden election. The final presidential debate is days away and the New York Post issues a blockbuster report on Hunter Biden's laptop. GOP LAWMAKER HINTS BIDEN IMPEACHMENT AS HUNTER SCANDAL DEEPENS: ‘HOW CAN WE NOT?’ It's a huge problem for the Biden team. Trump might use the revelations against their guy. What to do? Discredit the story. Play a dirty trick. WASHINGTON, DC - Hunter Biden (L) and President Joe Biden  (Photo by Teresa Kroeger/Getty Images for World Food Program USA / Getty Images) Enter Antony Blinken. He's now the Secretary of State, but back then he was a Biden campaign advisor. He contacted the acting head of the CIA, Michael Morell. They orchestrated a letter from 51 intelligence professionals, saying the laptop story was ""Russian disinformation."" That was a lie and they knew it. HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP IS THE ‘TIP OF THE ICEBERG’: REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY Days later candidate Biden used the letter in the debate. It proved, he said, that what Trump is saying, ""is a bunch of garbage."" It wasn't garbage. The laptop held a sordid tale of financial corruption, which should have been revealed to voters.

LARRY KUDLOW: The rule of law is the bedrock of free market capitalism,"FOX Business host Larry Kudlow calls out the Biden administration for failing to uphold the rule of law in the U.S. on 'Kudlow.' Once again, this evening, we're going to talk about political interference with our legal system and, yes, what I regard as sleazy and dirty political tactics. This is a business show, but I think these legal issues are very important to business and free enterprise. Stay with me on this.  The rule of law is absolutely essential, a bedrock of free market capitalism. It's what makes the American system so successful and popular and reliable and hospitable to investors and entrepreneurs here at home and frankly all around the world.  Again, let me repeat: the rule of law, based on the American constitution going back 250 years, is the essential bedrock of free market capitalism. So, to me, any administration, I don't care, Republican or Democrat, that interferes with the rule of law is undermining our economy, our future prosperity and frankly confidence in our whole system. That is why a business show like ours needs to report on these matters. Now, I'm going to connect some dots. It is alleged that Attorney General Merrick Garland has deliberately slow-walked the Hunter Biden investigations and a whistleblower, who apparently is a senior guy, who is not political, who employs a lawyer who has represented a number of Democrats, has been denied legal protection by AG Merrick Garland. CONSERVATIVE COLLEGE GRAD WHO WALKED OUT OF MERRICK GARLAND'S COMMENCEMENT SPEECH 'WOULD DO IT AGAIN' Merrick Garland, U.S. attorney general, speaks during the U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Jan. 21, 2022.  (Photographer: Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Let me note, that this is an allegation, not yet an evidentiary fact. Further, the whistleblower is alleging that A.G. Garland refused Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss' request for special counsel protection and at least two Biden-appointed U.S. attorneys have not cooperated with Weiss because Garland has ordered them to slow-walk or maybe not walk at all.  That is the allegation. Numerous legal commentators have noted that Hunter Biden's allegations regarding tax evasion and federal firearm offenses are so straightforward that they should've been settled in 5 days, not 5 years, quoting former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy. Now, again, these are allegations, but they have the ring of truth (Don’t they?) and this whistleblower is going to have his day in court, when he testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee, which will give him proper immunity, but again, my point is Merrick Garland's undermining our legal system, our rule of law, weaponizing our legal system, politicizing our legal system. This is so sleazy. Literally, a dirty trick to protect the president's son and protect the president. Not only from full transparency, but from our entire legal system. If this sort of sleazy tactics continues, at some point nobody is going to want to invest in the U.S. We'll be like Latin America. We'll be like Western Europe. Or, if we let big government get even bigger and even more unlimited, interfering with our legal system, we'll be like the old Soviet Union, or today's Venezuela, or even the Chinese Communist Party. We talk a lot about the economic impact of taxes, regulations, government spending and money printing. It's all terribly important -- for confidence and for economic prosperity, but the dependable rule of law is probably more important than any of those economic policies. Literally, it's what makes America great. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., gives his take on the Biden family's questionable business dealings on 'Kudlow.' Congressman Jim Jordan in his Judiciary hearings has unearthed a dirty-tricks operation led by current Secretary of State Antony Blinken during the 2020 campaign to protect Joe Biden in the second debate and later. Blinken and former deputy CIA director Mike Morell and their gang of 51 spies is a despicable political dirty trick. Blinken should not be in his position, but how different are the actions of A.G. Merrick Garland? Isn't his slow-walking another political dirty trick? Doesn't it undermine the rule of law and the Constitution itself and a million future investment decisions that will bypass America because our legal system looks to be unreliable? Hence economic damage? Hence undermining economic prosperity?  That's why a business reporter has to cover these stories. Save America. Protect our legal system.

National security expert warns there's likely more Chinese influence stations than what's been discovered,"America First Policy Institute senior fellow Steve Yates discusses the impact of Chinese influence in Sudan amid violent conflict. As the FBI and watchdog groups raise red flags around communist China influence centers based across America, one national security expert sounded alarms that the number of undercover police stations is likely to rise. ""I suspect that number of six is actually low, that all these community centers have been dual-use because the Communist Party ethnically targets its own citizens and friends and family,"" America First Policy Institute senior fellow Steve Yates said on ""Mornings with Maria"" Monday.

""An official with the Chinese National Police directed one of the defendants – a U.S. citizen who worked at the secret police station – to help locate a pro-democracy activist of Chinese descent living in California.

"US Navy to use unmanned, AI-driven ships to counter smuggling, illegal fishing","Builder.ai founder Sachin Dev Duggal calls for proper regulation, understanding and control around the use of artificial intelligence. The U.S. Navy is planning to expand its use of unmanned ships using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by deploying drone ships in the waters around Central and South America to counter smuggling operations along with illegal fishing by China. The Navy launched a drone ship initiative known as Task Force 59 in late 2021 in the 5th Fleet area, which includes much of the Middle East and several critical maritime chokepoints where the U.S. and partner countries have sought to counter piracy and smuggling. Earlier this month, the Navy announced it will move forward this year with a similar plan to deploy unmanned ships to the 4th Fleet, which has an area of responsibility covering the waters off both coasts of Central and South America and extends to Antarctica. ""The 4th Fleet area of operations provides us with an environment best suited to operationalize the concepts that Task Force 59 has worked tirelessly to develop to increase our maritime domain awareness or MDA capabilities,"" Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said at a Navy League luncheon earlier this month. ""The MDA technologies and platforms we are bringing to the region will address several significant challenges,"" Del Toro explained. ""These include narcotics and human trafficking, as well as economic and ecological harm caused by illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which the People’s Republic of China, through their distant water fishing fleets, participates in on both the Pacific Coast and the Atlantic Coast of Central and South America.""

"US defense industry scrambles to boost artillery production to aid Ukraine, deter China","Retired Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata discusses the impact of the classified Pentagon documents leak on Americas reputation and its implications on the war in Ukraine on Varney & Co. The U.S. defense industry is ramping up production of a critical type of artillery ammunition as the war in Ukraine has raised concerns that the production levels and pre-existing stockpiles could be insufficient for a broader conflict or a war with China. Ukraine has come to rely heavily on 155 mm artillery supplied by the U.S. and allied countries like those in NATO that use it as a standard-size heavy artillery round that can be precision-guided. The 155 mm artillery gives Ukraine the ability to strike Russian targets from 15 to 20 miles. However, Ukraine’s consumption rate of 6,000 to 8,000 shells per day has outpaced the production levels of the allied defense industrial base, causing the U.S. and other countries to scramble to expand production. The anticipated Ukrainian offensive this spring or summer is expected to increase that consumption even further to 7,000 to 9,000 155 mm shells per day. UKRAINE’S AMMUNITION DEMANDS ARE ‘MANY TIMES HIGHER’ THAN SUPPLY, NATO CHIEF SAYS U.S. Marines with Echo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment, operate a M777 towed 155 mm howitzer during Weapons and Tactics Instructors Course (WTI) 1-18 at Yuma, Ariz., on Sept. 30, 2017. The Scranton Army Ammunition Plant and a similar plant in nearby Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania are operated by General Dynamics. The two facilities have a contract to make 24,000 shells per month and also received a $217 million order from the Army to boost production further. The Scranton plant, which has produced ammunition for the U.S. military since the Korean War, faces limitations as officials look to expand capacity. The facility is in the midst of a $120 million modernization that the Army hopes will open a new production line by 2025, but the buildings’ listing on the National Register of Historic Places constrains how the structures can be altered. The Army has other contracts with factories in Texas and Canada to make more 155mm shells and is also working with other countries to step up production. US COULD QUICKLY RUN OUT OF MUNITIONS IN CONFLICT WITH CHINA, DEFENSE INDUSTRY UNPREPARED: REPORT 155 MM projectile round storage at Blue Grass Army Depot. Blue Grass Army Depot stores and surveilles conventional ammunition for the Department of Defense. According to a Pentagon fact sheet released in early April, the U.S. has provided over 160 155 mm howitzers and more than 1.5 million 155 mm artillery rounds to Ukraine since the war began. It has also provided over 14,000 155 mm Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems that contain four anti-tank mines that the round scatters on the ground near the target. Additionally, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with over 6,500 precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds, a figure which likely includes a variant of the munition known as the Excalibur or precision guidance kits that can be fitted to standard rounds. LOCKHEED MARTIN WRESTLES WITH SUPPLY-CHAIN ISSUES TO ARM UKRAINE LABEL AND LOAD: A contractor employee at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant labels a 155 mm artillery round as part of the load, assemble and pack operation. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) recently released a 44-page report that warned U.S. stockpiles of critical weapons systems are low. In particular, it noted that, in the event of a conflict between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, the U.S. ""would likely run out of some munitions – such as long-range, precision-guided munitions – in less than one week in the event of Taiwan Strait conflict."" It added that the war in Ukraine has ""exposed serious deficiencies in the U.S. defense industrial base and serves as a stark reminder that a protracted conflict is likely to be an industrial war that requires a defense industry able to manufacture enough munitions, weapons systems and materiel to replace depleted stockpiles."" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The CSIS report flagged inventories of several key weapons systems as being low, including the Javelin anti-armor weapons, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, 155 mm howitzers, 155 mm artillery rounds, and counter-artillery radars. It also noted that U.S. policy bars exports of cluster munitions with a dud rate greater than 1%. CSIS flagged inventories of Excalibur precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds as being medium and referenced that about 5,200 of the rounds have been provided to Ukraine. The think tank's report noted that defense contractors have committed to tripling the annual production of 155 mm shells over the next few years. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Social Security cost-of-living adjustment could be much smaller next year,"A 'Mornings with Maria' Word on Wall Street panel discusses the earnings season outlook, recession possibilities and rising price pressures on oil. Social Security recipients are on track to receive a more modest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) next year as once red-hot inflation continues to cool off. The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan group that focuses on issues relating to older Americans, estimated the adjustment could be about 3%, based on March inflation data, which showed the consumer price index climbed just 0.2% from the previous month and is up 5% from last year, the lowest pace since May 2021. The annual Social Security change is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or the CPI-W, which rose just 4.5% over the past year. Should Social Security beneficiaries see a 3% increase in their monthly checks next year, it would mark a steep decline from 2023, when recipients saw an 8.7% bump – the highest in four decades.

Still, it is a very early estimate and is subject to change, according to Mary Johnson, a policy analyst at the Senior Citizens League who conducted the research. The Social Security Administration will release the final adjustment percentage in October. ""If inflation continues to fall at the current rate it appears that the COLA for 2024 will be lower than 3%,"" Johnson said. ""Although easing inflation should relieve older consumers, new survey findings from The Senior Citizens League indicate that recent steep inflation has had long-lasting financial impacts on many older households, making recovery difficult."" JAMIE DIMON WARNS BANKING CRISIS HAS RAISED ODDS OF RECESSION Between January 2021 and December 2022, the average Social Security benefit fell short of high inflation by about $1,054 in total. This year's 8.7% benefit increase has exceeded the actual rate of inflation every month so far in 2023 by about 2.6%, according to the group's analysis, or roughly $44.90 per month. But average benefits have recovered only $179.40 since the start of the year – and that's the amount before the deduction of the Medicare Part B premium.

"China's push to hijack enemy satellites could be 'game over' for US, national security expert warns","John Hannah, former national security adviser for Vice President Cheney, joined ‘Cavuto: Coast to Coast’ to discuss the report indicating China is building weapons to overtake satellites. A national security expert is sounding the alarm on China's developing cyber capabilities after a classified U.S. intelligence leak reportedly exposed their efforts to build weapons to overtake enemy satellites. John Hannah, former national security adviser for Vice President Cheney, issued a dire warning Friday on China's aggressive investments in technology, arguing that their strategy is intended disrupt, degrade and destroy U.S. space capabilities. CHINA AND RUSSIA POSE INCREASING RISKS TO US IN NEW SPACE RACE ""The future of warfare, one of the most contested domains, is going to be space. Space, in essence, is the new high ground.

CHINA EXPERT WARNS US DEFENSE INACTION WILL HAVE A 'CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME' The revelations were included in classified U.S. intelligence allegedly leaked by 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, The Financial Times reported Friday. The CIA report assessed China's plan to use cyber weapons to ""deny, exploit or hijack"" Western satellites used for wartime communication and surveillance. China has increasingly invested in and enhanced their space programs in recent years, creating new threats to U.S. security. According to officials with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the communist nation has been reorganizing and reforming their space forces, using the majority of its 541 satellites sent to space for reconnaissance or intelligence gathering. Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang unpacks various actions from the Chinese which threaten U.S. national security on ‘Mornings with Maria.’ Hannah noted China's recent cyber-technology advancements have allowed them to not only disrupt U.S. satellites, but to ""mimic"" our frequencies. ""What we heard about it most recently in the leaks was this very advanced cyber capability that they have to not only disrupt our satellites and what they're able to see, but to actually have the same frequency and mimic our frequencies and actually communicate and take over our satellites,"" he said.

"Flesh-eating bacteria infections may rise as climate warms, study finds","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A recent study suggests that the warming climate may increase infections from a flesh-eating bacterium along the coast of the eastern United States. The study, published in Scientific Reports on March 23, examined how climate change may affect the spread of Vibrio vulnificus, a bacterium that usually lives in warm, brackish seawater, farther north up the East Coast. ""Greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are changing our climate, and the impacts may be especially acute on the world's coastlines, which provide a major boundary between natural ecosystems and human populations and are an important source of human disease,"" geoscientist Elizabeth Archer said in the study. Archer and her colleagues used data models to predict the future disease distribution.

Lyrid meteor shower: When it peaks and how to watch it,"A sonic boom was captured on a home video camera as a meteor crashed into the ground near McAllen, Texas. CREDIT: Fox 4 The April Lyrids will be active between April 20 and 30 this month. The meteor shower is expected to peak between 1:10 p.m. on April 22 and 12:45 a.m. on April 23, according to NASA. Its peak – which the agency notes is uncertain – has varied in past years, with the rate of meteors per hour also changing. The average peak rate is about 18 visible meteors per hour, but has shown higher rates of up to about 23 meteors per hour.

The Lyrids – one of the oldest known meteor showers – appear to radiate from near the constellation Lyra. Known for their fast and bright meteors, the Lyrids can produce the occasional fireball. Meteors come from leftover comet particles and bits from broken asteroids. When the comets move around the sun, they leave behind a dusty debris trail. Every year, the Earth passes through these trails, allowing the leftovers to collide with its atmosphere, creating streaks in the sky as they disintegrate.

"Scientists find concerning bird flu mutations, but US health officials say threat to humans is low","Lydia Wardle, JINYA Ramen Bar supply chain vice president, lays out the issues behind the egg shortage and the far-reaching costs on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ Although a man in Chile has been infected with a bird flu that has concerning mutations, the threat to humans remains low, according to U.S. health officials. Authorities said Friday that past animal studies suggest mutations could cause the virus to be more harmful or spread more easily, but that there is no evidence the mutations would make it easier for the virus to take root in a person's upper lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vivien Dugen said the mutations do not alter the assessment of the overall risk to people from H5N1, which ""continues to be low."" The agency's officials said the mutations may have occurred after the man was sickened. GRIZZLY BEARS, SKUNKS AMONG A DOZEN MAMMALS INFECTED WITH AVIAN INFLUENZA IN MONTANA New lab analysis examined the virus in the lungs of a 53-year-old man in the country's Antofagasta region. A World Health Organization summary of the case said he may have become infected through contact with sick or dead birds, or infected sea lions. The man had been healthy and had not traveled recently, but he started getting a cough, a sore throat and hoarseness on March 13. His symptoms worsened, and he was sent to an intensive care unit and treated with antiviral medicines and antibiotics.

Genetic sequencing this week revealed the two concerning mutations and Chilean and American health officials have been working together on the investigation. The case was the second human H5N1 bird flu virus infection reported in South America and the 11th globally since January 2022. In the U.S., one H5N1 case was reported last year in a person who reported fatigue without any other symptoms after poultry-culling activities. The mutations have appeared only in one hospitalized patient, and there is no evidence that the mutated virus has spread to others, mixed with other flu viruses or developed the ability to fight off current medicines or evade vaccines, they added.

""We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people."" Such changes have been witnessed in past bird flu infections. More than 450 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The majority of humans who have been infected have gotten it directly from birds. In the U.S., bird flu has recently been found in wild birds in every state, in addition to in commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks.

NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spots runaway black hole creating ‘trail of stars’,"During an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"", Jimmy Failla shares his thoughts on NASA announcing it is hiring two diversity champions. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has accidentally captured images of a ""runaway"" black hole barreling through space, leaving behind a contrail of newborn stars. The black hole, weighing as much as 20 million suns, is traveling through space so fast that if it were in our solar system, it could travel from Earth to the Moon in 14 minutes, according to NASA. An artist's impression of a runaway supermassive black hole.  (NASA) The 200,000-light-year ""contrail"" of stars that the black hole is leaving behind is approximately twice the diameter of the Milky Way. NASA said the phenomenon is likely the result of a game of ""galactic billiards among three massive black holes. The new stars are forming as the black hole is plowing into the gas in front of it to trigger new formations along a narrow corridor. NASA said the sighting is unprecedented. ""What we’re seeing is the aftermath. Like the wake of a ship we’re seeing the wake behind the black hole,"" Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, said in a statement. ""The trail must have lots of new stars, given that it is almost half as bright as the host galaxy it is linked to."" TOWNS UNDER 2024 SOLAR ECLIPSE'S PATH OF TOTALITY BEGIN PREPARING FOR RARE EVENT Van Dokkum said it was ""pure serendipity"" that researchers stumbled across the finding. According to NASA, van Dokkum was looking for globular star clusters in a nearby dwarf galaxy. ""I was just scanning through the Hubble image and then I noticed that we have a little streak. I immediately thought, 'oh, a cosmic ray hitting the camera detector and causing a linear imaging artifact,’"" van Dokkum said. ""When we eliminated cosmic rays we realized it was still there. It didn't look like anything we've seen before."" Spectroscopic observations reveal it is a 200,000-light-year-long chain of young blue stars.  (NASA) Van Dokkum investigated further and concluded that they were looking at the aftermath of a black hole flying through a halo of gas surrounding the host galaxy.

Georgia Power bills likely to rise by 12% in June,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. State regulatory staff and Georgia Power Co. have agreed on a plan that will boost power bills by 12% in June to cover the higher costs of natural gas and coal that the utility burns to generate electricity for its 2.7 million customers. The unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. filed new figures Monday saying it needs to collect an additional $6.6 billion from customers over the next three years, under an agreement it reached with Georgia Public Service Commission staff earlier this month. Because of declining natural gas price forecasts, that's actually $1.1 billion less than Georgia Power had earlier projected. But it will boost a typical residential bill to $147.50 a month, up $15.90 from the current $131.60. The increase had originally been predicted to be as high as $23. The five-member elected commission is scheduled to vote on fuel charges on May 16. Any final plan is likely to closely track the agreement between the company and the staff. Bill increases are stacking up for Georgia Power customers. Rates went up 2.5% last month in January after commissioners approved a three-year rate plan in December. Increases of 4.5% will follow in 2024 and 2025. Customers will also have to pay the costs of the third and fourth nuclear units at Plant Vogtle near Augusta. Unit 3 is projected to begin operation in May or June, leading to a roughly $4 a month increase for residential customers. A larger rate increase is likely to follow when Unit 4 begins operations, now projected before March 2024. GEORGIA BOY, 13, CHARGED IN EASTER SUNDAY MURDER OF MAN SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES Typically, a utility is allowed to charge customers for the cost of fuel, but isn’t allowed to make a profit on those charges, unlike the profits Georgia Power is guaranteed for investing in power plants and transmission lines. The all-Republican commission typically decides how much Georgia Power can collect for fuel once every two years. In the meantime, if prices change, the company may collect too much or too little. During this two-year period, even though commissioners approved a 15% boost in fuel costs that began in January 2022, the company collected far too little money. Natural gas prices skyrocketed because of an improving economy and the Ukraine war, and coal prices rose even more steeply in part because of supply and labor shortages. Georgia Power Co. and state regulatory staff agreed on a plan that will likely rise power bills by 12% in June. Georgia Power says it will end the period roughly $4.5 billion in the hole for fuel already burned. Most of the proposed rate increase will make up for that deficit, repaying the company over three years instead of the normal two because the debt is so large. The utility says it forecasts it also needs another $2.2 billion to make up for higher fuel prices going forward. Georgia Power and commission staff have agreed to let the company make larger changes to cover cost swings between fuel-cost rate cases. The agreement would let Georgia Power raise or lower fuel charges by as much as 40% in the interim, instead of the current 15%. Because of unrecovered debt, that ability would likely only be used to further raise customer bills in the next two years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The company and staff also agreed to raise a fuel cost discount for low-income senior citizens from $6 a month now to $8 a month. The Georgia Association of Manufacturers argues commissioners should stretch repayment of the deficit out over five years to reduce rate increases. Georgia Power said Monday it opposes a longer payback period. Environmentalists argue that commissioners should force Georgia Power to bear some rising fuel costs because it has shifted its generation portfolio to depend on natural gas, whose price is volatile. The company argues the commission has already approved the current generation mix as the most economical and reliable option. ",674,WORLD NEWS,us

FAA investigating bird strike-induced plane fire at Ohio airport,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Shortly after an ordinary takeoff from an Ohio airport on Sunday, passengers aboard an American Airlines plane became alarmed when they heard loud noises and saw flames shooting out of an engine. Moments later, when they learned a bird strike had caused an issue, many feared the worst. They took to their phones and social media to spread the word as the hobbled plane returned to the airport and landed without incident or injury. ""Scariest 30 minutes of my life this morning. And scary for my family, fiance, best friend & coworker who all got a text from me that my plane was crashing and I love them and I hope they get this message,"" Cassy Sleeper said in a Facebook post.

MEXICAN AIRLINER LANDS IN PUERTO VALLARTA AFTER ENGINE FAILURE American Airlines flight 1958 had 173 people on board when it departed from John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio, headed to Phoenix around 7:45 a.m. Sunday. The fire was detected a short time later and the Boeing 737 returned to the airport, where firefighters quickly doused the flames. John Fisher, another passenger aboard the flight, told WCMH-TV in Columbus that the pilot said a flock of geese flew into the engine. Phoenix-bound American Airlines Flight 1958 caught fire following a bird strike, shortly after taking off from John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Ohio. ""The engine started making real loud ‘clonk, clonk, clonk’ noises (and) they eventually turned the engine off and turned around and went back to the airport,"" Fisher said. The airline said the plane was taken out of service for maintenance and that the passengers were booked on other flights. The facility remained operating as usual, and the fire only caused some minor flight delays, airport officials said. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the matter. TEXAS AIRLINE WORKER DIES AFTER BEING INJURED AT AUSTIN-BERGSTROM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT The strike has again put a spotlight on the problems pilots, carriers and airports are facing as expanding bird and wildlife populations are making such strikes more commonplace, along with increased air traffic by quieter, turbofan-powered aircraft. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, 15,556 strikes were reported in 2021, an increase of 33% from the 11,666 strikes reported in 2020. Globally, wildlife strikes killed more than 300 people and destroyed roughly 300 aircraft from 1988-2021.

Clinic challenges Colorado's new ban on treatments reversing medication abortions,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The owner of a Catholic clinic challenging Colorado's new ban on unproven treatments to reverse medication abortions testified Monday that a state pledge not to enforce the ban for now wasn't enough to protect her staff and patients. At a hearing in federal court, DeDe Chism, co-founder and CEO of Bella Health and Wellness, said state lawmakers' comments during debate on the measure about wanting to come after faith-based clinics like hers made her fearful. She said she worried about what could happen if she continued to offer the treatments to women who wanted to stop a medication abortion. ""A promise is just a promise. I feel like I need something a little more concrete,"" she said at the hearing, which was held to determine if U.S. District Judge Daniel Domenico’s judge's temporary order stopping enforcement of the new law against her clinic should be extended. The clinic claims the ban violates a First Amendment right to free speech and religious exercise. After Domenico issued the temporary restraining order, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser revealed last week that the state’s medical and nursing boards had met behind closed doors recently and voted not to enforce the ban until a rulemaking process on the treatments is completed. That process won't be concluded until September, he said. In the meantime, Bella Health will not face any enforcement of the ban and therefore does not have grounds to challenge the law, he said. DEION SANDERS KICKS OFF COLORADO SPRING GAME WITH 98-YEAR OLD SUPERFAN, 'LOVES EVERY MINUTE’ OF NEW ERA A Colorado Catholic clinic is challenging the state's new ban on treatments that reverse medication abortions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ban was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis on April 14. It says health care workers who provide ""medication abortion reversal treatments"" would be engaging in unprofessional conduct and could be disciplined for providing them unless regulators pass rules saying that they are ""generally accepted standard of practice."" It gave the medical, nursing and pharmacy boards until Oct. 1 to enact rules on it. A representative of Weiser's office, Chief Deputy Attorney General Natalie Hanlon Leh, also testified during the court hearing that the office would not prosecute any clinic simply for advertising abortion reversal treatments under the state's anti-fraud law while the state boards consider how to label the treatments. Bella Health gives doses of the hormone progesterone to women who have taken the abortion pill mifepristone, which inhibits progesterone, and decide not to continue the abortion process by taking a second drug, misoprostol. Doctors use progesterone to try to prevent miscarriages. However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says using it to try to reverse medication abortions is ""unproven and unethical."" About a dozen states have passed laws compelling abortion providers to tell their patients about the treatments. However, according to the Guttmacher Institute, Colorado is the only state that has banned them. ",503,WORLD NEWS,us

"Carbon monoxide deaths are climbing, putting families in peril: ‘My son is lucky to be alive’","Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary on American tourists' deaths in the Bahamas, calls out CDC vaccine advisory panel pushing for COVID boosters in children Often dubbed ""the silent killer,"" carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless — it’s been shown to cause severe injury or death in hours or even minutes. Between 2009 and 2019, deaths from non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisoning have been on the rise, according to a new report released by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) last month. There were 250 deaths related to consumer products in 2019, more than in any other year in the report. Some 40% of those deaths were caused by engine-driven tools, including generators, power washers and lawn mowers. BAHAMAS SANDALS DEATHS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING, A QUIET KILLER Heating systems were behind another 28% of the deaths, the report said. Kristie Dusenberry, a mother and grandmother who lives with her family on a farm in American Falls, Idaho, knows all too well the devastating impacts of carbon monoxide poisoning. Her 21-year-old son, Brenden Dusenberry, nearly died recently when fumes filled his small apartment. About four months ago, her son had moved to Iowa, where he was living in an apartment above his uncle’s garage. ""He was excited about living closer to friends and had started a new job,"" Dusenberry told Fox News Digital in an interview. When a few family members tried to call Dusenberry’s son over the weekend, no one was able to reach him. Brenden Dusenberry, 21, from Idaho nearly died recently when fumes filled his small apartment. He is still recovering.  (Kristie Dusenberry) Around midnight on Sunday, Dusenberry got a call from her niece, who also lives at the house. ""She said Brenden was on the floor in the bathroom, couldn’t feel his left side and was throwing up,"" she said. ""No one had seen or heard from him for more than 24 hours."" When first responders arrived, they suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. Tests confirmed dangerously high levels in the room where Dusenberry’s son was found. ""They did say that all the carbon monoxide is gone — but all the damage it caused is not."" Over the next few hours, Dusenberry slowly pieced together what had happened. Her son had gotten very sick over the course of the day, then woke up in the middle of the night with severe thirst. When he tried to get out of bed, his entire left side had gone completely numb. ""Brenden fell and hit his head on a dresser, then tumbled down the stairs to the bathroom, and that's where they found him,"" Dusenberry explained. Brenden Dusenberry, 21, is pictured with his siblings (left). He's shown in the hospital after he was poisoned by carbon monoxide (right). (Kristie Dusenberry) The source of the fumes was a new heater for the outdoor swimming pool, which had just been hooked up and was kept in the garage below the room where Dusenberry’s son was living. Something had malfunctioned with the heater — causing carbon monoxide to fill the air. One of the doctors told Dusenberry that carbon monoxide is lighter than air. ""It actually floats and can go through sheet rock, or through any crack in the wall,"" she said. While Dusenberry realizes her son is lucky to be alive, she worries about his long and uncertain road to recovery. ""Brenden’s heart is not fully working right now,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""His lungs were inflamed when he got to the hospital, and he had to be put in a hyperbaric chamber to increase his oxygen levels."" TEXAS CARBON MONOXIDE LEAK HOSPITALIZES 6, INCLUDING 5 CHILDREN Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is sometimes used ​​for people who have moderate to severe carbon monoxide poisoning as a means of reducing the long-term cognitive effects. That's according to Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, medical toxicologist and co-medical director at the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C. ""People who have confusion, heart rhythm abnormalities or other evidence of heart damage, and other serious signs or symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, are potential candidates for hyperbaric oxygen therapy,"" she told Fox News Digital. Brenden Dusenberry, 21, who experienced carbon monoxide poisoning just last week, gets some physical therapy in the hospital. (Kristie Dusenberry) The doctors also realized that Dusenberry’s son’s kidneys weren’t functioning correctly, which meant he had to receive dialysis treatments. ""Brenden also has nerve damage on the left side of his body, and the doctors said it could take up to a year before he can use his left arm again,"" Dusenberry said. ""He still can’t walk, and he can’t keep any food or fluids down."" She added, ""They did say that all the carbon monoxide is gone — but all the damage it caused is not."" Dr. Dung Trinh, a brain health expert and owner of The Healthy Brain Clinic in Long Beach, California, said the most dangerous outcomes of carbon monoxide poisoning can include death, permanent organ damage and long-term neurological effects. ""Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that can bind to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing its ability to carry oxygen, leading to tissue hypoxia and damage to vital organs,"" he told Fox News Digital via email. LOVE THAT ‘NEW CAR SMELL’? STUDY SAYS THERE ARE CANCER-CAUSING CHEMICALS TO CONSIDER In cases where carbon monoxide poisoning is fatal, Trinh said the specific cause of death is often related to severe tissue hypoxia (low levels of oxygen in the tissues) and damage to the brain, heart or lungs, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or other life-threatening complications. Each year, carbon monoxide poisoning claims at least 420 lives. The effects of carbon monoxide poisoning can vary, depending on the severity of the exposure and individual factors, the doctor explained. ""In some cases, with prompt and appropriate medical treatment, the effects may be reversible, while in other cases, they may be permanent,"" he said. Certain people may be at a higher risk of dying or not recovering fully from carbon monoxide poisoning, such as infants, elderly individuals, pregnant women and those with pre-existing respiratory or cardiac conditions, the doctor said. Those who survive carbon monoxide poisoning may experience adverse long-term effects. ""These can include neurological symptoms like memory problems, difficulty concentrating and mood changes, as well as respiratory and cardiac issues, depending on the severity and duration of exposure,"" Trinh said. Dawn Quintana, 56, shown here, experienced carbon monoxide poisoning at her workplace in 2013. She still experiences cognitive deficits today. (Dawn Quintana) Dawn Quintana, a 56-year-old former IT worker in Lake Point, Utah, experienced carbon monoxide poisoning at her workplace in 2013, when machinery was being used inside with all the doors and windows closed. TOXIC CHEMICAL POISONING: HAVE YOU BEEN AFFECTED? HOW TO KNOW After repeated daily exposure — 10 hours a day, five days a week, for 90 days — Quintana was regularly experiencing severe flu-like symptoms and lost her sense of taste. When she was finally tested at the hospital, her levels of exposure were dangerously high. To this day, even after seven years of therapy, Quintana still experiences the lingering cognitive effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. ""Carbon monoxide poisoning is a medical emergency and requires prompt medical intervention."" ""Sometimes I know what I want to say, but it doesn't come out,"" she told Fox News Digital in an email. She also struggles with reading: ""I can look at something and read it silently just fine, but if I try to read out loud, the letters start to fall away from the page and the left side of the page goes blank."" Quintana has not been able to return to work. She can no longer look at computer screens without getting dizzy and nauseated. Her relationships with friends and family have suffered. ""The struggle that I go through daily — the loss of dignity — I would not wish it upon my worst enemy,"" she said. Each year, carbon monoxide poisoning claims the lives of at least 420 people and sends more than 100,000 people to emergency rooms in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased for approximately $20."" The good news is that it’s 100% preventable. ""Some strategies for safety and precaution against carbon monoxide poisoning include regular maintenance and inspection of fuel-burning appliances, proper ventilation in enclosed spaces, using carbon monoxide detectors and avoiding the use of fuel-burning appliances indoors or in enclosed spaces without proper ventilation,"" Trinh said. You may not be able to see, smell or taste carbon monoxide — but a working carbon monoxide detector can enable you to ""hear"" it, said Johnson-Arbor. ""Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased for [about] $20 at big-box retailers, home improvement stores or even on Amazon,"" she told Fox News Digital. Residential carbon monoxide detectors can be plugged into an electrical outlet or can be hard-wired into a home’s electric system. (iStock) Residential carbon monoxide detectors can be plugged into an electrical outlet or can be hard-wired into a home’s electric system, Johnson-Arbor said. Experts recommend having a carbon monoxide detector installed within 10 feet of every sleeping area. ""Because carbon monoxide poisoning can cause excessive sleepiness, it’s important to have a detector installed within 10 feet of every sleeping area of your home,"" she said. Additionally, she recommends bringing a portable carbon monoxide detector when traveling, because some hotels or vacation rentals may not have them installed.

Be well: Catch skin cancer warning signs early with regular self-exams,"Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the rise of artificial intelligence in medicine, including a new tool that accurately detects early markers of brain cancer. Every day, more than 9,500 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with skin cancer, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, a New York City-based nonprofit. Early detection and treatment is the key to a positive outcome, doctors say — and performing regular self-exams is the best way to catch the warning signs. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends checking your skin from head to toe at least once a month. HUGH JACKMAN UNDERGOES BIOPSIES FOR CANCER SCARE, EMPHASIZES SUNSCREEN USE ""A change to a mole, a sore that won’t heal or a new growth may be a warning sign of skin cancer,"" said Dr. Nandini Kulkarni, medical director of surgical oncology for Inspira Health in Vineland, New Jersey. ""By conducting regular skin checks, you will become familiar with the pattern of moles, blemishes, freckles and other marks on your skin,"" she said. Check your skin from head to toe at least once a month, says the Skin Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit. (iStock) ""When you notice a change, you should see your dermatologist."" Keep an eye out for any new, expanding or changing growths, spots or bumps on the skin, says the American Cancer Society. ""Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, even areas that are not exposed to the sun."" Other warning signs include a sore that bleeds and/or doesn’t heal after several weeks, a rough or scaly patch of skin, a wart-like growth, or an irregularly shaped or colored mole. ""The letters A-B-C-D-E can help you remember what to look for,"" said Dr. Kulkarni. These include: A - Asymmetry B - Borders (irregular, raised) C - Color (especially change in color of a prior mole) D - Diameter (larger than a pencil eraser) E - Evolving changes The best time to do a skin self-exam is after a shower or bath, according to Dr. Kulkarni. Keep an eye out for any new, expanding or changing growths, spots or bumps on the skin, experts recommend. (iStock) For consistency, do the exam the same way each time. Choose a well-lit room and use both a full-length mirror and a hand mirror to ensure that nothing gets missed, the doctor said. SKIN CANCER CHECKS AND SUNSCREEN: WHY THESE (STILL) MATTER VERY MUCH FOR GOOD HEALTH In addition to the more obvious areas, such as the face, arms, legs and sides, remember to check hidden spots like between the fingers, the soles of the feet and the scalp. ""If needed, ask someone for help when checking your skin,"" Dr. Kulkarni suggested. ""This can help with hard-to-see areas like your back and scalp."" The experts agree that self-exams should be a supplement to regular checks at the dermatologist — not a replacement.

"Strep throat infections have spiked above pre-COVID highs, says report: 'We've missed cases'","Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier discusses the rise of Group-A Strep and other respiratory illnesses after the deaths of two Colorado children. After plummeting during the COVID pandemic in 2020 and 2021, strep throat infections skyrocketed in February 2023, according to a report from Epic Research, a health analytics firm. The rate of infections of group A strep (caused by the Streptococcus bacteria) was 30% higher than the previous peak seen in February 2017, the report found. Leading up to the pandemic, between January 2017 and February 2020, cases of strep throat followed a consistent pattern. Usually, the cases would begin to increase in the fall and peak in February — before dipping again in spring and summer, said the reports from Epic, which is based in Verona, Wisconsin. 'GREAT CONCERN': INVASIVE GROUP A STREP CASES SPIKING IN PARTS OF US — CDC IS INVESTIGATING Starting in March 2020, amid stay-at-home orders early in the pandemic, strep throat infections plummeted. Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that severe cases of strep infections decreased by around 25% during the pandemic. After plummeting during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, strep throat infections skyrocketed in February 2023, according to a report from Epic Research of Wisconsin. (iStock) Strep cases didn’t start to increase again until September 2022, then skyrocketed in the winter leading into 2023. Epic’s data is based on the share of clinic and emergency room visits between January 2017 and February 2023 that resulted in positive group A strep cases across the U.S. and Lebanon. (The data come from ""Cosmos, a HIPAA-defined Limited Data Set of more than 184 million patients from 199 Epic organizations including 1,147 hospitals and more than 24,900 clinics,"" said Epic in its report, in part.) A majority of the cases affected children ages 4 to 13. HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SHOULD DROP MASK REQUIREMENTS, MEDICAL EXPERTS SAY ""The rates of group A strep infections, including the more dangerous invasive type, are at the highest levels seen in years,"" confirmed Dr. Shana Johnson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician in Scottsdale, Arizona. ""In February, strep cases were 30% higher than the previous peak seen in 2017."" The CDC’s early data also reflect these findings, showing that cases of both invasive and less severe strep are at elevated levels, ""similar to or higher than those seen in pre-pandemic years."" Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, told Fox News Digital that the spike in strep A cases is likely a result of other circulating viruses. ""The recent assault of viruses, including COVID-19, have weakened people’s immune systems,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Also, we haven't been on the lookout for it and have missed cases."" In most cases, strep A causes mild illness, with common symptoms including sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever, red and swollen tonsils, swollen lymph nodes and tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth, per the CDC. Occasionally, group A strep can lead to severe infections (invasive Group A strep, or iGA), which in rare cases can cause sepsis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis (a serious bacterial infection that destroys tissue). These cases require immediate treatment. The rate of Streptococcus (strep) bacteria infections was 30% higher than the previous peak seen in February 2017. (iStock) In the U.S., there are between 14,000 and 25,000 cases of invasive group A strep cases per year, with 1,500 to 2,300 of them causing death, the CDC reported. ""Unlike respiratory viral illnesses like the common cold and flu, group A strep is best treated with antibiotics,"" Dr. Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""Antibiotics for strep throat reduce how long you are sick and prevent the infection from getting more severe and spreading to other parts of the body."" With the current antibiotic shortage, some cases aren’t receiving timely treatment, Dr. Siegel said. ""When we don't treat it quickly, it has more time to spread,"" he told Fox News Digital. EUROPEAN UNION DRUG REGULATOR DETERMINES ANTIBIOTIC SHORTAGE NOT A ‘MAJOR EVENT’ In October 2022, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) reported a shortage of amoxicillin, which, along with penicillin, is among the most commonly prescribed treatments for strep. As of April 2023, amoxicillin remains on the drug shortage list. Group A strep bacteria spreads through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, per the CDC’s website. ""The recent assault of viruses, including COVID-19, have weakened people’s immune systems."" ""If you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes after touching something that has these droplets on it, you may become ill,"" the CDC said. In most cases, strep A causes mild illness, with common symptoms including sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever, red and swollen tonsils, swollen lymph nodes and tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth, per the CDC. (iStock) To help reduce the spread, doctors say to wash hands often with soap and water, avoid sharing glasses or utensils with those who are infected, and cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

"Flu diagnosis could significantly raise heart attack risk, new study finds","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. People who get influenza could be six times more susceptible to having a heart attack in the days following a flu diagnosis, a new study from the Netherlands has found. The study’s conclusions were scheduled to be presented on April 18 at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in Copenhagen, Denmark, as reported by Medscape. The lead researcher, Dr. Annemarijn de Boer with the Julius Center for Life Sciences and Primary Care at the University Medical Center Utrecht, analyzed test results from 16 labs in the Netherlands, as well as medical and death records. Of 26,221 cases of influenza between the years 2008 and 2019, 401 people experienced at least one heart attack within a year of the diagnosis, the report said. HEART DISEASE RISK COULD BE AFFECTED BY ONE SURPRISING FACTOR, NEW STUDY FINDS Additionally, people had a 6.16 times higher likelihood of having a heart attack in the week after getting the flu compared to the year before or after, the researchers found. However, when excluding the deaths that occurred outside the hospital, the increased risk was 2.42 times instead of 6.16. People who get influenza could be six times more susceptible to having a heart attack in the days following a flu diagnosis, a new study from the Netherlands has found. (iStock) This is likely because most flu testing in the Netherlands is performed in the hospital, which means patients are more likely to have severe illness, according to de Boer. Similar findings came from a 2018 Canadian study led by Dr. Jeffrey C. Kwong from the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto, Ontario. Researchers found that participants were 6.05 times more likely to have a heart attack in the week after diagnosis. Board-certified cardiologist Dr. Mary Greene with Manhattan Cardiology in New York City was not involved in the study, but reviewed the findings. HEART DISEASE, THE SILENT KILLER: STUDY SHOWS IT CAN STRIKE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS ""While the methodology of this particular Dutch study did not yield as much robust data, the study certainly echoes previous studies that have come to similar conclusions,"" Greene told Fox News Digital. ""Seemingly common colds can turn into serious medical issues."" ""I do agree that a flu diagnosis can increase the odds of heart attack in a select group of patients, especially those with underlying heart disease,"" she added. The increase in heart attacks among patients diagnosed with influenza, said Greene, largely stems from the inflammatory process and the environment that is created within the body when someone is fighting off the flu or other viral illnesses. To help minimize the risk of heart attacks, all people should have a cardiovascular screening starting at age 40, or earlier if there is a history of early heart disease in the family, says one cardiologist. (iStock) ""Such inflammation in the body can make cholesterol plaques more vulnerable to rupture and blood more likely to clot, which is the underlying mechanism of both myocardial infarction (heart attack) and ischemic stroke,"" she said. Dr. Craig Bober, a family medicine physician at Inspira Medical Group Primary Care Mantua in Sewell, New Jersey, who was also not involved in the Dutch research, noted a key limitation of the study. ""It is important to note that the study was not designed to reflect the generalized population, as it looked at only those tested in hospital settings — these patients tend to be the sickest and usually elderly,"" he told Fox News Digital in an email. FDA APPROVES FIRST AT-HOME TEST TO DETECT BOTH FLU AND COVID ""However, the study certainly emphasizes the dangers of seemingly benign virus-mediated infections."" Fox News Digital reached out to the study author for comment. To help minimize the risk of heart attacks, all people should have a cardiovascular screening starting at age 40, or earlier if there is a history of early heart disease in the family, said Greene of New York City. The increase in heart attacks among patients diagnosed with influenza, said one cardiologist, stems from the inflammation that occurs when someone is fighting off the flu or other viral illnesses.

"AI model helps predict strokes with more accuracy, researchers say","'The CyberGuy' Kurt Knutsson gives a rundown on concerns over using artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and scammers using the software for voice cloning. Using machine learning methods and available data when patients enter the hospital, researchers have developed a model that predicts strokes with more accuracy than current models. The team from Carnegie Mellon University, Florida International University and Santa Clara University published their work in the Journal of Medical Internet Research earlier this year. Examining more than 143,000 hospital visits of patients in Florida acute care hospitals from 2012 to 2014, and social determinants of health data – including the conditions people are born into and live in, and what drives those conditions – from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, the study's authors sought to develop a stroke-prediction algorithm. Their model incorporated variables routinely collected by health care providers and payers, including basic demographics, the number of chronic conditions and insurance.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The authors said the model had 84% precision in predicting strokes, outperforming existing scales that miss as many as 30% of strokes. The authors said use of the model suggests that it is possible to predict the likelihood of a patient’s condition being a stroke at the time of hospital presentation, based on patients’ demographics and social determinants of health available at the time of entry – before obtaining any diagnostic imaging or laboratory test results. There were some limitations to the study, including that the study was retroactive, that confirming stroke cases relied on International Classification of Diseases codes and did not involve reviewing patients’ records, and the social determinants of health variables available in administrative data. Furthermore, they cautioned that their algorithm should not be considered as a gold standard for stroke diagnosis, but as a model that complements existing stroke-scoring systems used in hospitals.

""But such information may not be readily available when patients are initially triaged in hospital emergency departments, especially in rural and underserved communities.""

"Hospitals and health care facilities should drop mask requirements, medical experts say","Walensky told Congress that masking guidance ‘doesn’t really change with time’ but with the level of disease. Even after mask mandates were dropped across the country amid dwindling COVID-19 cases and deaths, face coverings have still been required in many doctors’ offices, hospitals and other health care settings. Now, a group of esteemed medical experts is calling for a change. In an April 18 journal entry in the Annals of Internal Medicine, an academic medical journal, several physicians — including infectious disease specialists — wrote that it’s time to remove masking requirements in health care facilities. ""While critically important in the earlier phases of the pandemic, we’ve entered a more stable phase, with substantial population-level immunity, durable protection against severe disease, a series of less virulent variants, and other important and favorable changes,"" said corresponding author Erica S. Shenoy, M.D., PhD, in a press release. FACE MASKS MADE ‘LITTLE TO NO DIFFERENCE’ IN PREVENTING SPREAD OF COVID, SCIENTIFIC REVIEW FINDS She is the medical director of infection control for Mass General Brigham and an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""As conditions change, we need to re-evaluate our infection prevention policies, including masking requirements in health care settings, and adapt,"" she added. Even after mask mandates were dropped across the country amid dwindling COVID-19 cases and deaths, face coverings have still been required in many doctors’ offices, hospitals and other health care settings. Now, a group of doctors is calling for this to end.  (iStock) Other contributing physicians came from Harvard Medical School, Washington University School of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine and Trinity Health Michigan. ""Masking requirements in health care have continued longer than in the community because these settings have a higher proportion of individuals at high risk for complications of infection,"" the authors wrote in the journal entry. ""However, the context and conditions of the pandemic have changed dramatically and favorably since masking requirements in health care were initially adopted, and evidence-based public health policy should also adapt in response."" Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical and a Fox News contributor, agreed with the decision. ""It makes complete sense to remove the universal mask requirements for medical centers — and NYU did it weeks ago,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""It hasn't made sense for a while."" ""We should adapt mask policies to reflect this new reality."" Dr. Shana Johnson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician in Scottsdale, Arizona, reviewed the doctors’ recommendations. ""As we transition to the place where SARS-CoV-2 is a constant and stable presence in our community, we should adapt mask policies to reflect this new reality,"" she told Fox News Digital. In the journal entry, the authors pointed out that masking in health care settings was appropriate early in the pandemic as a means of limiting spread among medical personnel, patients and visitors. Dr. Marc Siegel of New York City said he continues to wear a KN95 or N95 mask in the room with most patients, especially those with respiratory symptoms. He said, however, that it ""makes complete sense to remove the universal mask requirements for medical centers."" (iStock) But as the population has achieved greater immunity and COVID has entered a ""more stable phase"" — and as public health agencies and the U.S. government have declared that the public health emergency is over — the physicians stated in the findings that the small benefits of continuing to require masks don’t justify the costs. ""Masks do have downsides, such as impaired communication and disrupted human connection."" ""After three years of universal masking in health care, the risk-benefit calculation has shifted,"" said Shira Doron, M.D., chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine health system and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, in the press release announcing the paper. ""Masks do have downsides, such as impaired communication and disrupted human connection.  We are at a stage of the pandemic where it now makes sense to end mandatory masking,"" she added. PARENTS NOW QUESTION WHETHER COVID MASK MANDATES DID MORE HARM THAN GOOD Among the drawbacks of masks, the study authors cited an ""increased cognitive load"" for doctors who are trying to listen to patients wearing face coverings. This is particularly difficult for patients who do not speak fluent English or who are hard of hearing, they added. ""Masks obscure facial expression; contribute to feelings of isolation; and negatively impact human connection, trust and perception of empathy,"" the authors wrote. ""Masking is not without its downsides,"" Dr. Johnson said. ""Masks make it more difficult to hear, understand and communicate with your provider. Some choice makes sense."" In lieu of universal masking, the study authors suggested that health care settings should follow ""Standard Precautions and Transmission-Based Precautions,"" as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""Masks obscure facial expression; contribute to feelings of isolation; and negatively impact human connection, trust and perception of empathy,"" the authors wrote. (iStock) Health care personnel should wear masks to prevent exposure as needed, according to those guidelines. Also, any people with respiratory symptoms (namely, coughing or sneezing) should use a face covering. Additionally, if a medical worker is ""caring for patients with suspected or confirmed respiratory infection, they should use personal protective equipment and other interventions."" Rather than having universal masking requirements, Dr. Siegel believes the decision should be ""based on individual risk."" ""Universal masking in health care is a policy whose time has come and gone ... for now."" ""It should be reserved for patients who are immunocompromised or severely or chronically ill or the doctors that care for them,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Patients who are acutely ill and those with chronic lung problems should continue to wear masks."" The doctor said he continues to wear a KN95 or N95 mask in the room with most patients, especially those with respiratory symptoms. ""Certain health care settings with high-risk patients could still choose to use universal masking, but it would not be required in other areas of normal risk,"" added Dr. Johnson. Along with dropping mask requirements in health care settings, the physicians wrote that other protocols should be reconsidered. The doctors wrote that in addition to universal masking, other early pandemic strategies, such as asymptomatic testing and contact tracing, should also be reconsidered. (AP) ""Moving away from universal masking policies should be accompanied by reconsideration of other pandemic-era strategies (for example, asymptomatic testing, resource-intensive contact tracing), which similarly have experienced a shift in their risk-benefit balance over the course of the pandemic,"" they stated in the discussion. The latest commentary doesn’t mean that masking policies won’t return sometime in the future, the physicians noted. ""Future pandemics or significant localized outbreaks may justify more widespread or targeted masking policies, respectively, as part of a bundled response,"" they wrote, noting that it’s important to educate health care personnel and patients as policies change. COVID-19'S LASTING IMPACT: 'LESS ATTRACTIVE' PEOPLE WEAR MASKS MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS, STUDY FINDS ""Change and adaptation are expected,"" said senior author Dr. Westyn Branch-Elliman, an infectious diseases specialist and clinical investigator at VA Boston Healthcare System. ""That does not mean 'the science has changed,' but almost everything around it has."" The doctors called for ""focused research"" to ""ensure requirements are not maintained longer than necessary and are reinstated when needed."" Additionally, the authors noted that the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ""is currently reevaluating existing approaches to Transmission-Based Precautions, which is likely to inform future considerations for health care transmission mitigation strategies."" The authors pointed out that masking in health care settings was appropriate early in the pandemic as a means of limiting spread among medical personnel, patients and visitors. Now, however, they said that ""universal masking in health care is a policy whose time has come and gone … for now.""

ChatGPT for health care providers: Can the AI chatbot make the professionals' jobs easier?,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he was ""a little bit scared"" of ChatGPT and admitted that his technology would likely destroy ""a lot of current jobs."" In addition to writing articles, songs and code in mere seconds, ChatGPT could potentially make its way into your doctor’s office — if it hasn’t already. The artificial intelligence-based chatbot, released by OpenAI in December 2022, is a natural language processing (NLP) model that draws on information from the web to produce answers in a clear, conversational format. While it’s not intended to be a source of personalized medical advice, patients are able to use ChatGPT to get information on diseases, medications and other health topics. CHATGPT AND HEALTH CARE: COULD THE AI CHATBOT CHANGE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE? Some experts even believe the technology could help physicians provide more efficient and thorough patient care. Dr. Tinglong Dai, professor of operations management at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School in Baltimore, Maryland, and an expert in artificial intelligence, said that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have ""upped the game"" in medical AI. Some experts believe that the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot could help physicians provide more efficient and thorough patient care. (iStock) ""The AI we see in the hospital today is purpose-built and trained on data from specific disease states — it often can't adapt to new scenarios and new situations, and can't use medical knowledge bases or perform basic reasoning tasks,"" he told Fox News Digital in an email. ""LLMs give us hope that general AI is possible in the world of health care."" One potential use for ChatGPT is to provide clinical decision support to doctors and medical professionals, assisting them in selecting the appropriate treatment options for patients. In a preliminary study from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, researchers analyzed the quality of 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions regarding clinical decisions. Out of the 20 highest-scoring responses, nine of them came from ChatGPT. ""The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low acceptance, bias, inversion and redundancy,"" the researchers wrote in the study findings, which were published in the National Library of Medicine. Dai noted that doctors can enter medical records from a variety of sources and formats — including images, videos, audio recordings, emails and PDFs — into large language models like ChatGPT to get second opinions. AI HEALTH CARE PLATFORM PREDICTS DIABETES WITH HIGH ACCURACY BUT 'WON'T REPLACE PATIENT CARE' ""It also means that providers can build more efficient and effective patient messaging portals that understand what patients need and direct them to the most appropriate parties or respond to them with automated responses,"" he added. Dr. Justin Norden, a digital health and AI expert who is an adjunct professor at Stanford University in California, said he's heard senior physicians say that ChatGPT is probably ""as good or better"" than most interns during their first year out of medical school. One potential use for ChatGPT is to provide clinical decision support to doctors and medical professionals, assisting them in selecting the appropriate treatment options for patients. (iStock) ""We’re seeing medical plans generated in seconds,"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""These tools can be used to draw relevant information for a provider, to act as a sort of ‘co-pilot’ to help someone think through other things they could consider."" Norden is especially excited about ChatGPT’s potential use for health education in a clinical setting. ""I think one of the amazing things about these tools is that you can take a body of information and transform what it looks like for many different audiences, languages and reading comprehension levels,"" he said. ""Currently, ChatGPT has a very high risk of being 'unacceptably wrong' far too often."" For example, ChatGPT could enable physicians to fully explain complex medical concepts and treatments to each patient in a way that’s digestible and easy to understand, said Norden. ""For example, after having a procedure, the patient could chat with that body of information and ask follow-up questions,"" Norden said. The lowest-hanging fruit for using ChatGPT in health care, said Norden, is to streamline administrative tasks, which is a ""huge time component"" for medical providers. In particular, he said some providers are looking to the chatbot to streamline medical notes and documentation. ""On the clinical side, people are already starting to experiment with GPT models to help with writing notes, drafting patient summaries, evaluating patient severity scores and finding clinical information quickly,"" he said. Some experts believe that AI language models such as ChatGPT could potentially help streamline patient discharge instructions.  (iStock) ""Additionally, on the administrative side, it is being used for prior authorization, billing and coding, and analytics,"" Norden added. Two medical tech companies that have made significant headway into these applications are Doximity and Nuance, Norden pointed out. Doximity, a professional medical network for physicians headquartered in San Francisco, launched its DocsGPT platform to help doctors write letters of medical necessity, denial appeals and other medical documents. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH CARE: NEW PRODUCT ACTS AS 'COPILOT FOR DOCTORS' Nuance, a Microsoft company based in Massachusetts that creates AI-powered health care solutions, is piloting its GPT4-enabled note-taking program. The plan is to start with a smaller subset of beta users and gradually roll out the system to its 500,000+ users, said Norden. While he believes these types of tools are still in need of regulatory ""guard rails,"" he sees a big potential for this type of use, both inside and outside health care. ""If I have a big database or pile of documents, I can ask a natural question and start to pull out relevant pieces of information — large language models have shown they're very good at that,"" he said. The hospital discharge process involves many steps, including assessing the patient’s medical condition, identifying follow-up care, prescribing and explaining medications, providing lifestyle restrictions and more, according to Johns Hopkins. AI language models like ChatGPT could potentially help streamline patient discharge instructions, Norden believes. AI VS. CANCER: MOUNT SINAI SCIENTIST SAYS BREAKTHROUGH TECH HAS ‘DRASTIC IMPACT’ ON DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT ""This is incredibly important, especially for someone who has been in the hospital for a while,"" he told Fox News Digital. Patients ""might have lots of new medications, things they have to do and follow up on, and they're often left with [a] few pieces of printed paper and that’s it."" He added, ""Giving someone far more information in a language that they understand, in a format they can continue to interact with, I think is really powerful."" While ChatGPT could potentially streamline routine health care tasks and increase providers’ access to vast amounts of medical data, it is not without risks, according to experts. Dr. Tim O’Connell, the vice chair of medical informatics in the department of radiology at the University of British Columbia, said there is a serious privacy risk when users copy and paste patients’ clinical notes into a cloud-based service like ChatGPT. ""We want medical AI software to be trustworthy."" ""Unlike ChatGPT, most clinical NLP solutions are deployed into a secure installation so that sensitive data is not shared with anyone outside the organization,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Both Canada and Italy have announced that they are investigating OpenAI [ChatGPT's parent corporation] to see if they are collecting or using personal information inappropriately."" Additionally, O’Connell said the risk of ChatGPT generating false information could be dangerous. Health care providers generally categorize mistakes as ""acceptably wrong"" or ""unacceptably wrong,"" he said. While ChatGPT could potentially streamline routine health care tasks and increase providers’ access to vast amounts of medical data, it’s not without risks, experts say. (Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""An example of 'acceptably wrong' would be for a system not to recognize a word because a care provider used an ambiguous acronym,"" he explained. ""An 'unacceptably wrong' situation would be where a system makes a mistake that any human — even one who is not a trained professional — would not make.""
