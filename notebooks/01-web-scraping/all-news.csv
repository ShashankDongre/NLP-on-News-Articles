"Sudan fighting: Civilians in untenable situation, Red Cross says"," People are making desperate attempts to flee Sudan after more than a week of fighting there, the Red Cross says. The situation was now ""untenable"" for civilians left without food or water, and some hospitals had stopped working, spokeswoman Alyona Synenko said. Convoys leaving the capital Khartoum had encountered robbery and looting, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. People getting out of Khartoum spoke of corpses left lying on the street. ""We saw bodies everywhere - there's no security whatsoever so nobody dares go collect them - but there's utter destruction too. Everything is just devastated,"" Italian NGO boss Stefano Rebora told the BBC. South African diplomat Clayson Monyela said all routes out of Khartoum - a city of six million people - were ""risky and dangerous"". ""The airport remains closed, the fighting continues,"" he told the BBC. He reiterated a call for a ceasefire to allow people to leave, and aid to enter. Sudan was suffering an ""internet blackout"" with connectivity at 2% of ordinary levels, monitoring group NetBlocks said on Monday. In Khartoum, the internet has been down since Sunday night. Meanwhile, water and electricity have been restored to some parts of the capital, but not all of them. One Nigerian student told the BBC: ""The taps are outside in the street and that's the scary part - sometimes we are going out to get water but there is shooting or explosions going on, so we just have to run there and get the water and come back."" Numerous countries have evacuated their civilians - and thousands of other people have made risky escapes. Many of those who have left Khartoum have headed to other parts of the country where they have family ties - leaving parts of the city centre completely deserted. Others have gone north to Egypt by bus, or headed south. Officials in neighbouring South Sudan said the roughly 10,000 refugees who had arrived in recent days came from Eritrea, Kenya and Uganda - as well as from Sudan and South Sudan themselves. Multiple countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate diplomats and civilians from Khartoum. By Monday about 1,100 European Union citizens had been taken out of Sudan, an EU diplomatic source told the BBC. The bloc believed about 1,700 EU citizens had been in Sudan when the fighting began. The US said it had airlifted fewer than 100 people by helicopter on Sunday in a ""fast and clean"" operation. The American embassy in Khartoum is now closed, and a tweet on its official feed says it is not safe for the government to evacuate private US citizens. The UK government airlifted British diplomats and their families out of the country. Foreign Minister James Cleverly said options to evacuate remaining Britons were ""severely limited"". Canada has evacuated its diplomatic staff. Turkey - a key player in Sudan - began evacuation efforts by road from the southern city of Wad Medani on Sunday, but plans from one site in Khartoum were postponed after a nearby explosion. More than 150 people - mostly citizens of Gulf countries, as well as Egypt, Pakistan and Canada - were evacuated by sea to Saudi Arabia. Long lines of UN vehicles and buses were seen leaving Khartoum on Sunday, heading east towards Port Sudan on the Red Sea and carrying ""citizens from all over the world"", a Sierra Leonean evacuee told AFP news agency. However many foreign students from Africa, Asia and the Middle East are among the foreigners still trapped in Khartoum. The western region of Darfur - where the RSF first emerged - has also been badly affected by the fighting. The UN has warned that up to 20,000 people - mostly women and children - have fled Sudan to seek safety in Chad, across the border from Darfur. However in other parts of the country, some semblance of normalcy has emerged. In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, there has been less gunfire and explosions than in previous days, possibly to allow civilians to leave. Heavy fighting outside the army headquarters has stopped. As a result, for the first time since hostilities broke out more than a week ago, women and children have been out on the streets, visiting neighbours and going to markets, which still have some basic supplies such as oil and wheat. There are long queues outside the few bakeries that remain open. More than 400 people have died in the conflict, and thousands have been injured, according to the latest tally from the World Health Organization. But it is feared the true toll is much higher. Several ceasefires that seemed to have been agreed were subsequently ignored - including a three-day pause to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which started on Friday. The UN's World Food Programme says the fighting could plunge millions more Sudanese into hunger in a country where a third of the population already struggles to get enough to eat.

Jerusalem: Five injured in Palestinian car ramming attack," Five people have been injured in a car-ramming attack by a Palestinian in central Jerusalem, Israeli police say. The vehicle hit pedestrians near the busy Machane Yehuda market. The attacker was shot and killed at the scene by a civilian. Police say the assailant was a 39-year-old man from occupied East Jerusalem. It came as Israel began to mark Memorial Day for fallen soldiers and victims of attacks - one of the most solemn days in the national calendar. Speaking at a Memorial Day event, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was ""another attempt to murder Israeli citizens"". ""These terrorist attacks come with the expectation that they will overcome us and will uproot us from here, and if they could, they would murder us all. But they will not overcome us; we will overcome them."" Footage from the scene just moments after the incident shows a dark-coloured Chevrolet hatchback, its front crumpled and windscreen cracked, at a standstill on a zebra crossing between Kiah Street and Agrippas Street. A man in a dark blue T-shirt and black jeans is seen slumped over the bonnet, not moving, as police and civilians mill around. Israel was on heightened alert ahead of Memorial Day, which commemorates soldiers and civilians who have been killed in conflict and attacks since 1860. The sombre occasion leads into Independence Day on Tuesday night and Wednesday. The day is celebrated with patriotic events, with this year marking Israel's 75th anniversary. Palestinians, however, consider Israel's formation in 1948 as a catastrophe which led to the displacement of up to 750,000 of their people in the Arab-Israeli war that followed. Monday's attack comes amid a surge in Israeli-Palestinian violence this year. In the early hours of Monday, a 20-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed during an Israeli army arrest raid in a refugee camp near the city of Jericho, in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said. Since the start of this year, more than 90 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. Eighteen Israelis, a Ukrainian and an Italian - all civilians, except for an Israeli paramilitary police officer - have been also killed in attacks by (or suspected to have been carried out by) Palestinians and, in one case, an Israeli Arab.

Beyoncé and Ronaldo among those to lose Twitter blue check in purge," What do Beyoncé and Cristiano Ronaldo have in common? As of today, they are no longer verified on Twitter. The social media giant began removing the once-coveted blue tick verification from thousands of accounts on Thursday. The move comes as owner Elon Musk attempts to overhaul the social media company to turn a profit. Users who wish to retain the check beside their name must pay $84 a year (£67) to subscribe to Twitter Blue. As some lost their ticks, others kept them. Despite saying he would not pay to be verified, LeBron James still has a blue tick which is a ""complimentary subscription"" gifted by Elon Musk. The billionaire confirmed Stephen King and William Shatner also got the same deal. As the change happened, many formerly verified took to Twitter to joke about it, or mourn the loss. US Olympian Lolo Jones noted she's still verified where it counts: her dating profile. Other users noted the irony that actor Jason Sudeikis had lost his verification, while Ted Lasso, the fictional character he portrays, had not. US rapper Ice T joked that the uproar over the checks was unnecessary. ""The fact that we're even discussing Blue check marks is a Sad moment in society,"" he posted. The company first introduced the verification feature in 2009, after a former professional baseball player sued the social media giant over imposter accounts. The blue check became a status symbol and a sign of authority. But in the new Twitter-verse, Mr Musk wants users to pay to be verified. The decision to monetise verification could usher in a massive cultural and power shift on the platform. In the days before verification, Kanye West, Shaq and Ewan McGregor were among the first celebrities to  speak out about being impersonated on Twitter. Now that the badges are gone, a celebrity's follower count may become the only way to tell the difference between someone famous and an imposter. Within a few hours of losing verification, an account posing as Hillary Clinton, complete with the same profile picture as the former US senator, ""announced"" she would again run for the presidency. Under Twitter's new verification scheme, gold, grey and blue badges are meant to provide more context to how an account was verified. But the lack of verification is already causing confusion. In New York City, a new handle has claimed to be the ""authentic Twitter account"" representing the government. Experts warn these are the kind of tweets that could lead to the spread of misinformation. Mr Musk has tried to frame the decision to do away with verification as a way to democratise content on the site. But critics have argued the move will amplify disinformation as Twitter Blue subscribers will get prioritised rankings - Mr Musk has said that only verified accounts will appear in the site's prominent For You stream. Social media monitors and experts fear the rise in paid verification will lead to an amplification of misinformation on the site. If that were to happen, it could scare off yet more advertisers - and undermine any extra revenue Twitter is getting from its verification subscription model. But Mr Musk said pain is a part of change. ""I feel like we're headed to a good place,"" he told BBC News. ""Overall, I think the trend is very good."" Additional reporting by Shiona McCallum.

Buzzfeed News to close as media firm cuts jobs," Buzzfeed is to close its news site and cut its workforce by 15%, chief executive Jonah Peretti has said. It comes as the digital media company faces serious financial challenges, including a slump in advertising spending. Calling the decisions ""deeply painful"", Mr Peretti said he could not invest more in the unprofitable news site. He said the firm would focus on delivering news via the HuffPost, which Buzzfeed took over two years ago. ""Our industry is hurting and ready to be reborn,"" he said in a memo to staff. ""We are taking great pains today, and will begin to fight our way to a bright future."" Founded in 2006, Buzzfeed was once one of the trendiest names in online media, known for its quizzes and viral content, as well as a serious news operation. But the firm, which employed more than 1,300 people globally at the end of last year, has shifted away from news, as bringing in ad revenue and audiences became more difficult and other lines of business, such as producing custom content, grew more quickly. It listed on the stock exchange in 2021, but raised far less money than it had hoped. ""While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division, we've determined that the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization,"" Mr Peretti wrote to staff. Many other advertising-reliant companies, including media firms and tech giants such as Facebook's owner Meta, have been making job cuts in recent months, while investors have been forced to reassess the values of upstart news ventures such as Vice News and Vox Media. News company Insider also revealed plans on Thursday to reduce its workforce by 10% or about 95 jobs. Mr Peretti said his company, which will continue to operate HuffPost, its food brand Tasty, Complex Networks, and its namesake website, had faced wider challenges but he also blamed himself. He said he had been ""slow to accept"" the difficulties of making money from online news with distribution dominated by big tech platforms. The firm should have generated more revenue after acquiring Complex in 2021, which runs the music site Complex and other brands, he added. ""I could have managed these changes better as the CEO of this company and our leadership team could have performed better despite these circumstances."" he said. In her own memo to staff, parts of which she shared on social media, Buzzfeed News editor-in-chief Karolina Waclawiak said the company should have tried to build a business around its news site earlier, describing the closure as ""avoidable"". She said the failure was indicative of a wider crisis in journalism and she feared the results if subscription-based news models were the only ones that survive. ""The implication is that only people who can afford to pay for it will have access to high quality information while everyone else will need to parse through the rampant misinformation that is widely shared across social platforms,"" she wrote. ""The consequences of this are dire."" Buzzfeed had already announced several rounds of layoffs in recent years, including one in December that affected roughly 170 people or 12% of staff. The latest cuts involve about 180 jobs. Buzzfeed said it expected to incur $7m (£5.6m) - $11m (£8.8m) in severance and other charges connected to the move. Some of the news staff may find roles in other parts of the firm, the company said. Shares fell 20% on Thursday on the news, reducing Buzzfeed's market value to about $100m (£80m) - a fraction of the more than $1.5bn (£1.2bn) valuation investors were reportedly discussing just two years ago.

The tech entrepreneur betting he can get younger," Our ultimate demise is inevitable, but a growing number of experts believe how we feel in our later years may not be. They talk of ""healthspans"" - the number of healthy years of our lives. Life expectancy may have doubled over the last 150 years, but many of us have seen the undignified and devastating decline of our loved ones as they aged. To avoid that fate a new industry is emerging, promising a longevity revolution with techniques they say lead to healthier, longer lives. Business is booming for those in this space, with supplements being touted as having the ability to battle our cellular decline, and all sorts of hot and cold therapies trying to help us reduce inflammation and disease risk in our bodies. So I set out on a trip to the centre of it all, California, unsure as to whether I was arriving at the heart of a money-spinning cult, or the next frontier of medicine. Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is spending millions a year trying to reduce his biological age - how old his body seems, rather than his actual chronological age, which is 45. There's a good reason for any of us to do this. Age is the highest risk factor for disease, whether it's cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or dementia, so if ageing as a whole could be delayed, then so could the risk of onset of these conditions. For him though, it's a sport. In Mr Johnson's luxurious Venice Beach home, a bedroom has been converted into a clinic where he spends many hours. He wakes at 5am, eating his first meal an hour later, followed by a second, and final one at 11am. This, combined with a forensically selected 54 pills, a mix of supplements and off-label medication, are all planned based on readings from a catalogue of tests. His days consist of a torturous exercise regime, monitoring and numerous treatments. He told me the all-over skin laser treatment he's been having has reduced his skin age by 22 years, the greatest age reduction in any part of his body. The aesthetics are just a small part of it all though, as he reminds me ""our skin is our biggest organ"". Mr Johnson was warm, logical and likeable. I left his house wanting to be (a bit) like him. Maybe I am already - I run 5km a day, try to avoid sugar, and test extreme tracking devices for fun. My colleagues considered Mr Johnson's existence joyless, so his life is clearly not for everyone. While his routine might seem extreme, every conversation I had still came back to lifestyle. ""Lifestyle is responsible for about 93% of your longevity - only about 7% is genetics,"" says Eric Verdin, chief executive of The Buck Institute for Ageing Research. ""Based on the data [if we live healthily], I would predict that most people could live to 95 in good health. So there's 15 to 17 [extra] years of healthy life that is up for grabs for all of us,"" he told me. The big question, which Mr Verdin and others are investigating, is what does a healthy lifestyle mean? Take exercise for example - should that be a daily stroll, or a HIIT class? The same goes for healthy eating. Is fasting as important as avoiding sugar? And what about a good night's sleep? You can't underestimate the obsession with sleep I came across. I met many people setting their alarms not to wake up in the morning, but to remind them to go to bed on time for a full eight hours. Well, we all set the bar at different levels. Mr Verdin practises what he preaches, his regime consisting of ""a whole lot of exercise, some fasting, good sleep, lots of social connections, very little alcohol"". His suggestion for others? ""Try to spend at least 14 hours of your 24 hours without ingesting any calories as this has a profound effect on your metabolism."" The jury is out on how healthy this is for some women though. Keeping better track of our bodies as they age might help. Health risks could be flagged in advance and any new drugs could be applied just at the right time. Make it personalised, make it pre-emptive, make it better is the mantra. It was interesting to see that pretty much all of those working in longevity science wear more than one tracker themselves - commonly a smartwatch and a smart ring (way more convenient for sleep I can tell you - and these people are obsessed with prioritising sleep). More technology of business: For my part I've found health tracking illuminating. I am not diabetic, but have been fascinated by the findings of a continuous glucose monitor I wore for a while. The assumption is progress on longevity will come, albeit in a less sensational form than some may be hoping for. Experts suggest that a drug might emerge that will initially make a year or two's difference, then a few years more with the next generation, and so on. But along with such progress will come practical and ethical dilemmas. One fundamental question is whether ageing can be defined as a disease. This might simplify the approval of drugs by regulators, but risks labelling people over a certain age ""diseased"". The cost of such treatments may or may not (for developed medical systems anyway) be an issue, depending on what it turns out to be. Meanwhile, a healthier life is likely to lead to a few extra years of existence, so we may need to work longer. On my longevity learning mission, my expectations were upturned. I'd seen the sensationalist headlines, suggesting tech billionaires lounging on their yachts, deliberating over whether they fancied saving the world, going to space, or ""curing"" ageing. This wasn't the reality I saw. The wealthy have been giving money to medical research for years. This is just a new generation of wealth, and a potential new specialism of medicine. Plus it's really interesting, and affects us all. But right now, extending your healthspan involves hard work. As Silicon Valley-based journalist Danny Fortson put it: ""Exercise is hard, magic pills are easy, so that's why everyone is so excited about the pill."" So I returned home feeling more determined than ever to live my healthiest life - sleep better, exercise without excuse, eat well, cherish social connections (yes, this was on the longevity prescription). With a bit of luck that might buy me enough time to benefit from any scientific breakthroughs. ",1094,business,2023-04-20T23:01:42.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65238774
How LinkedIn is changing and why some are not happy," Social media is where we project a version of ourselves. And a pensive Dan Kelsall is nothing like his rowdy character on LinkedIn, the social media platform famously tagged ""Facebook for suits"". In the online world the co-founder of Manchester marketing firm Offended makes sure his business lives up to its name. His posts stick out for the prevalence of profanity and no holds barred humour. Offended specialises in guerrilla marketing, turning the world of corporate messaging and polished branding upside down. As the irreverent Mr Kelsall puts it: ""We don't just get our own ads banned, we get ads banned for our clients too."" With 900 million of the world's professionals registering their personal CV and career attainments on the site, LinkedIn has become a valuable resource for head-hunters and human resources departments. But over the last three years or so, this once staid community billboard of career updates and business launches has seen a change in tone. Many posts have become more personal, featuring the emotional backstories of its members with accounts of childhood influences and admissions of failings and frailties. This is a far cry from the hard-sell approach beloved of many corporate players and not everyone is happy. Critics murmur that these posts are more suited to the weekend musings of Facebook or the raucous tone of Twitter. So what has triggered this change? According to Mr Kelsall, boredom with corporate marketing is one culprit. It's hard to imagine, but Mr Kelsall once worked as a copywriter for a tax software firm, producing ""some of the driest things I've written"". He may not have enjoyed this time, but it did give him an insight into what pulls in readers. ""Consumers are less and less trusting of big brands. People are tired of boring marketing. ""The skill is to speak like your audience and be relatable to your audience. I've been on LinkedIn for seven years and I've got 66,000 followers. That's a really engaged audience."" Parry Headrick founded Massachusetts public relations business Crackle. He attributes his entire client base to introductions via LinkedIn. There his followers learn about his penurious childhood and his own children's lives. It's not to everyone's taste, though. One LinkedIn user responded to his disclosures with: ""Nice story. It doesn't belong on LinkedIn."" Mr Headrick disagrees. ""Engagement is about telling a compelling story. Your parents didn't read you a press release at bedtime, they read you stories. I try to give an insight into who I am if you work with me."" He is scathing about the effort businesses put into ""company pages on LinkedIn that get no engagement"", pointing out that human tales work. ""It's the personal element that engenders trust."" Mr Headrick sees his personal pronouncements as ""part of a broader shift away from corporate speak"". So what changed to make businesses so informal? Azadeh Williams thinks she knows. Speaking from the Sydney offices of her media and marketing company, AZK Media, she explains why she shares updates about her six-year-old daughter. ""I was a journalist for 20 years and I can spot marketing rigmarole and a contrived script. You have to be your crude, authentic self to attract your audience."" She wouldn't have posted this material a few years ago, but with the pandemic Zoom meetings intruded into the domestic space. This has changed everything. ""Before Covid families didn't exist for your work colleagues. Now they've seen the families and it makes us more interesting."" She believes that while LinkedIn has evolved from being the home of CVs, many users retain the mindset that it's just a digital job interview. Douglas Rode runs recruitment giant Page Group in the UK and Ireland. As LinkedIn is such an important tool in his world how does he view its new incarnation? ""Even five years ago people didn't open up so much. Now there's greater awareness of people's vulnerabilities such as mental health and LinkedIn has magnified this."" As a job-hunting expert would he advise someone to bare their soul there? His response is very qualified. ""It's a matter of individual choice. You are putting yourself out there so a future employer can see you. You're trying to get a balance and you want to sound human, not generic or automated."" Others are more pointed. Tom Skinner, of London marketing agency Go Up, fears LinkedIn's new emotional tone is merely a symptom of celebrity culture and ""a society that celebrates people who can self-publicise above all else"". LinkedIn has a 200-strong team working on stories primed to attract attention and involvement, all grist to the mill of recruiting companies that pay it for the right to scour the CVs of its members. Dan Roth, Editor in Chief at LinkedIn, denies cultivating controversy to pull in readers. ""We use algorithms to determine the right content for you but we do not steer people in one direction."" He too credits the pandemic with the shift in attitudes. ""People found they got remarkable feedback when they talked about their mental health."" He sets great store by LinkedIn users being identifiable in contrast to anonymous contributions on Twitter. Yet despite this public profile many members are unaware of how cringeworthy their stories can be. More technology of business: Braden Wallake rushed to LinkedIn when he made two staff at his Ohio company redundant in August 2022, boasting of how ""vulnerable"" he felt when making this decision. He even adorned the post with a tearful selfie. The first response to his post was a single word. ""Muppet."" Furthermore, he was rewarded with the online title, The Crying CEO, and became the poster boy for what behavioural insights expert Helen Jambunathan calls the ""LinkedIn cringe"". Ms Jambunathan says LinkedIn's algorithms reward posts that provoke engagement, even if this dilutes its recruitment industry origins. ""LinkedIn is becoming more personal and generalised, and less about 'work' as we know it."" This trend comes from the top. Research group Kekst CNC analysed the LinkedIn profiles of chief executives across the UK, US, Germany and Sweden, noting that 77% of them post personal content. Maybe the ""Facebook for suits"" is fine with its new knockabout tone. And the louder the criticism, the more people listen. Back in Manchester Mr Kelsall is relaxed about making the odd enemy. ""Sometimes you need detractors as much as you need fans."" ",1055,business,2023-04-17T23:05:19.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65123115
US savers get savvy ditching and switching banks," A wave of transfers is hitting US banks, as a sharp rise in interest rates after years of low borrowing costs creates more opportunity for savers - and new challenges for banks. Until recently, Claire, a software engineer, stashed all her money in a chequing account she had opened years ago as a university student. She let thousands of dollars build up there despite its paltry interest rate. The prospect of earning 4% or more shook her out of her complacency. This month, she transferred $20,000 (£16,000) to a different bank offering a higher interest rate. ""I never paid attention. I just left my money in the account,"" says the 26-year-old, who lives in Massachusetts and credits a personal finance podcast with alerting her to better options. ""I don't want my money to just sit in one place. I want to make the most out of it."" Banks have paid notoriously low rates on savings for years - something that has yet to change at many of the biggest firms, despite the US central bank hiking its benchmark rate from near zero to more than 4.75% in just a year. But there are signs that the sharp climb may be starting to shake up the status quo - unsettling a financial system accustomed to relying on low-cost deposits as a key source of funding and profits. ""It's a competitive market,"" Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase told investors on Friday, as the firm reported that average deposits had fallen 8% from a year ago. Roughly 30% of US bank customers moved money from their primary account to another bank in March, up from 27% in the previous year, according to a survey by consumer intelligence firm JD Power. A third said they were making the switch for higher rates, up from a quarter a year earlier. That's a ""slow climb"", says Paul McAdam, JD Power's senior director of banking. ""But extrapolate this across millions of consumers and it makes a difference."" Questions about how banks will handle the change sharpened last month after the US was hit by the two biggest bank failures since the 2008 financial crisis. In the weeks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, billions of dollars in deposits shifted hands, jolting a system accustomed to savings serving as a stable source of funding. While that rush appears to have subsided, many banks say they expect consumers to continue to hunt for the best deals, as online banking makes shifting funds easier than ever and rapid price inflation makes people unusually sensitive to erosion in the power of their savings. ""Consumers are more aware of how their returns stack up against the loss of buying power,"" says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which has tracked interest rates offered to consumers for decades. ""They have taken notice of the higher returns available at some banks and not others and have moved their savings accordingly."" Many people, like Claire, are switching allegiances to open new high-yield or money market savings accounts, which can pay interest rates of 3.5% or more, compared to the 0.24% average interest rate on a traditional savings account, according to data collected by Bankrate. Others are shifting their money out of banks entirely, opting for other kinds of investments, such as US government bonds or money market mutual funds, which buy relatively low-risk short-term government and corporate debt and can offer rates north of 4.5%, but offered little advantage over a savings account when interest rates were low. The moves led deposits held by banks in the US to fall last year for the first time in decades, dropping more than $200bn at the end of December from a year earlier, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Fitch expects deposits to decline by another $1.6 trillion this year. ""Banks and policymakers were ready for the deposit outflows that were happening through February. What is definitely the case now is we have increased uncertainty as to whether outflows will turn out to be bigger than historical norms,"" says Alexi Savov, professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business. The decline in deposits so far is still consistent with what typically happens when interest rates rise. Overall, the banking system remains flush with cash, reflecting the unprecedented surge in deposits during the pandemic, as savings rates increased and government assistance programmes fattened people's accounts. But worries abound about what lies ahead for the economy as the funds available for lending shrink. Analysts say some banks, especially the biggest, can afford to lose some of their outsize deposits, without a major hit to profit or activity. But Prof Savov says the outflows will put pressure on others, especially smaller regional firms, squeezing profits and leading them to pull back their lending - with potentially serious ramifications for local economies and some business sectors, such as commercial property, where regional banks play a big role. The recent bank failures caused a sharp acceleration in outflows from those smaller players, he notes. ""It creates a much bigger risk of a bumpy landing, potentially a recession,"" Prof Savov says. ""It's just such a live ball."" The growth of money market funds, which saw their holdings surge in the weeks after the banking crisis, has sharpened the removal of money from the economy, since the funds do not play a direct role in lending, while having the option of parking their holdings with the US central bank, says Steven Kelly, senior research associate at the Yale School of Management's programme on financial stability Their growth also risks making the financial system more unstable, since the firms in charge of such investments are quick to flee at signs of trouble, unlike everyday depositors, who can count on the government to guarantee accounts up to $250,000, he adds. ""An insured depositor maybe won't run at the first sign of bad news,"" he says, but a money market fund is likely to ""just disappear overnight"". If the economy encounters serious problems, the US central bank is expected to cut rates - a scenario many investors see as happening sooner following the bank panic. That means the reshuffling of deposits, as people like Claire seek more for their savings, could prove short-lived too.

Dominic Raab dismissed my behaviour warnings - Lord McDonald," Dominic Raab dismissed repeated warnings about his behaviour, a retired senior civil servant who worked with him in the Foreign Office has said. Lord McDonald described his former boss as a ""tough taskmaster"" whose methods did not help him achieve his aims. He told the BBC he raised this with Mr Raab more than once but he ""disputed"" it and was unwilling to listen. The former deputy PM, who resigned on Friday after a bullying inquiry, apologised if he upset anyone. The inquiry found he was ""intimidating"" and ""aggressive"" towards officials, but Mr Raab said his behaviour was not bullying, and that almost all of the complaints against him were dismissed. It looked at eight formal complaints about Mr Raab's behaviour during his previous stints as justice secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary. Senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC, who led the inquiry, concluded Mr Raab's conduct involved ""an abuse or misuse of power"", and that he ""acted in a manner which was intimidating"" and ""persistently aggressive"" towards officials. Mr Tolley said he found a description of bullying had been met when Mr Raab was foreign secretary and justice secretary. But, in relation to complaints from his time as justice secretary, Mr Tolley concluded Mr Raab ""did not intend by the conduct described to upset or humiliate"", nor did he ""target anyone for a specific type of treatment"". In an exclusive interview with BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Lord McDonald, who worked as Mr Raab's permanent secretary in the Foreign Office, said: ""I witnessed a tough taskmaster. I witnessed a minister who knew what he wanted to do. ""Frankly, I witnessed somebody whose methods did not help him achieve what he wanted to do and that I raised with him more than once."" Asked if Mr Raab was willing to listen, he replied: ""No, he disputed it, he disputed the characterisation."" Lord McDonald said he had not used the word 'bullying' to Mr Raab, partly because things had not reached that stage at the time. ""I was trying to get my boss to see how his behaviour was making his professional life more difficult. I was trying to help him get the best out of his team and I felt saying bullying would have been too aggressive,"" he said. Lord McDonald was not at the Foreign Office at the time of the incidents which were complained about and upheld by the inquiry. Mr Raab, a close ally of the prime minister, stood down on Friday after previously vowing to resign if the inquiry found he had bullied people. In his resignation letter to the prime minister, he accepted the inquiry's findings but said they were ""flawed"". Writing back, Rishi Sunak said his former deputy had kept his word, but he thought there had been ""shortcomings"" in the process and had asked civil servants to look at how complaints are handled. In his first interview since stepping down, Mr Raab told the BBC the findings set ""a very dangerous precedent"", with many ministers now fearful that they may be treated the same if they ""fairly"" bring ""direct challenge"" in government. ""If the bar, the threshold for bullying is lowered that low, it's almost impossible for ministers to deliver for the British people and I think it'll have a chilling effect on effective government, and the British people will pay a price,"" he said. Asked if the blunt truth was that he was a nightmare to work for, the former justice secretary said: ""Well actually, almost all of the complaints against me were dismissed."" And asked if he wanted to apologise, he said: ""If someone had hurt feelings, because of something I did, of course, I want an empowered team. ""The vast majority of the civil servants who worked for me were brilliant, fantastic and actually relished the energy, the challenge, the drive that I believe I brought. ""But of course, I don't want to upset anyone and I made clear that I'm sorry for that. But that's not bullying, and we can't deliver for the British people if the bar is that low."" Mr Raab also said a ""very small minority of very activist civil servants"" were effectively trying to block reforms they did not like, related to areas including Brexit, prisoner parole and human rights. ""That's not on. That's not democratic,"" the MP for Esher and Walton said. But Lord McDonald denied there was any civil service activism, passive aggression or a separate civil service agenda. He added: ""I saw no evidence of a small group of activists trying to undermine a minister. The issue is a minister's behaviour."" The FDA union, which represents civil servants, has accused Mr Raab of peddling ""dangerous conspiracy theories that undermine the impartiality and integrity of the civil service"" to ""deflect from an independent investigation's criticism of his conduct"". But Conservative peer Lord Marland said Mr Raab's resignation was ""almost a conspiracy by the civil service"". Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, he said it was ""a very black day for all employers"" because a ""dangerous precedent has been set"" [on the issue of workplace bullying] that would ""send shudders through all employers in the country"". Hannah White, director of the Institute for Government think tank, said ""no civil servant would feel encouraged to speak out in future"" after the responses of Mr Sunak and Mr Raab to the Tolley report. She said Mr Sunak had missed an opportunity to reinforce standards and ""the mutual suspicion which has been growing between ministers and civil servants remains and nothing has been done to reduce the risk of future problems.""

Dominic Raab resigns as bullying inquiry finds 'aggressive conduct'," Dominic Raab has resigned as deputy prime minister after a bullying inquiry found he acted in an ""intimidating"" and ""aggressive"" way towards officials. The inquiry, by a senior lawyer, was set up by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after eight formal complaints about Mr Raab's behaviour as a minister. The lawyer made multiple findings that fit a description of bullying in a report submitted to Mr Sunak. Mr Raab said the inquiry was ""flawed and sets a dangerous precedent"". The senior Conservative MP said he would quit the government if the inquiry by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC made any finding of bullying against him whatsoever. The bullying complaints, which involved 24 people, relate to Mr Raab's previous periods as justice secretary and foreign secretary under Boris Johnson, and his time as Brexit secretary under Theresa May. Mr Tolley's report concluded Mr Raab had engaged in an ""abuse or misuse of power"" when foreign secretary, and ""acted in a manner which was intimidating"" towards officials at the Ministry of Justice. In a resignation letter to Mr Sunak, Mr Raab said the inquiry ""dismissed all but two of the claims levelled against me"". He said he feared the inquiry would ""encourage spurious complaints against ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people"". In a letter to Mr Raab, Mr Sunak said his former deputy had kept his word after ""rightly"" undertaking to resign if the report made any finding of bullying whatsoever. But the prime minister said he thought there had been ""shortcomings"" in the process and had asked civil servants to look at how complaints are handled. The prime minister's spokesperson said Mr Sunak did not regret appointing Mr Raab to be his deputy. The resignation of Mr Raab - one of Mr Sunak's key supporters during the Conservative leadership contest last year - triggered a mini-reshuffle of Mr Sunak's top team. Mr Sunak has promoted two of his closest allies - Oliver Dowden as deputy prime minister, and Alex Chalk justice secretary - to fill the posts left vacant by Mr Raab. Mr Raab's political fate had been hanging in the balance for about 24 hours after the prime minister received the report from Mr Tolley on Thursday morning. Mr Raab's resignation is the third departure of a cabinet minister since Mr Sunak became prime minister. A Downing Street source said Mr Sunak did not urge Mr Raab to resign. Labour has accused Mr Sunak of being weak for failing to sack Mr Raab. ""We've had 13 years of Tory PMs trying to dodge the rules and defend their mates,"" a Labour source said. ""Enough is enough."" The Liberal Democrats said Mr Raab's resignation should trigger a by-election for his Esher and Walton seat, in Surrey, calling him ""unfit to represent his constituents in Parliament"". In his conclusions, Mr Tolley said he found a description of bullying had been met, when Mr Raab was foreign secretary and justice secretary. The High Court in 2021 defined bullying, and confirmed that harassment, bullying and discrimination was not consistent with the Ministerial Code and was not to be tolerated, as Mr Tolley points out in his report. Mr Tolley said Mr Raab had ""acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting"", and that his behaviour involved ""an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates"". Mr Tolley also said, at meetings with policy officials, Mr Raab ""acted in a manner which was intimidating, in the sense of going further than was necessary or appropriate in delivering critical feedback"". Mr Raab was ""also insulting, in the sense of making unconstructive critical comments about the quality of work done (whether or not as a matter of substance any criticism was justified)"", Mr Tolley said. He said Mr Raab ""did not intend by the conduct described to upset or humiliate"", nor did he ""target anyone for a specific type of treatment"". Mr Raab pulled no punches in his resignation letter. He made that clear that, while he accepted the outcome of the inquiry, he did not agree with the findings against him. He said ministers ""must be able to give direct critical feedback on briefings and submissions to senior officials, in order to set the standards and drive the reform the public expect of us"". While he apologised for any ""unintended"" stress caused, he attributed this to the ""pace, standards and challenge"" he brought to the Ministry of Justice. ""In setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry has set a dangerous precedent,"" Mr Raab wrote. His main argument appears to be that ministers need to be able to give direct critical feedback, and exercise direct oversight, over their civil servant officials. One question now is whether he decides to take any further action. He has punchily accused some civil servants of ""systematic leaking of skewed and fabricated claims"" and claimed a senior official initiated a ""coercive removal"" of some of his private secretaries last year. Someone who advised Mr Raab in a senior role in one department told the BBC his resignation letter contained ""one of the best examples of a 'non-apology' from a minister in recent years"". The person said Mr Raab's version of being the deputy prime minister ""is one that should be learnt from and ultimately consigned to the history books"". A senior Tory MP and former Cabinet minister said: ""Has Dominic Raab been hard done by? Certainly. Is he the victim of a civil service union ambush? Probably."" The FDA, a union that represents civil servants, has called for an independent inquiry in to ministerial bullying following the Raab investigation. FDA General Secretary Dave Penman said Mr Raab's resignation was a ""damning indictment"" of the process for enforcing ministerial standards within government.

"Local elections 2023: Residents in Orchard Park, Hull, on why so few vote"," When people across England take part in next month's local elections many of those on Hull's Orchard Park estate will more than likely stay away. The ward recorded the city's second lowest turnout in 2022, with just 15% of the 10,300 eligible to vote choosing to have their say - the city's overall turnout was 23.5%. With the 4 May ballot looming the BBC asked residents what needed to change to reverse the apparent apathy. Scrawled on a whiteboard inside St Michael's Youth Project are the hopes and dreams of this estate's future voters. Among the handwritten notes one stands out - ""Escape the ordinary"". The day before my visit to the centre, which aims to help young people and their families in one of England's most deprived areas, staff chatted with a group of teenagers about how life on the estate might be improved. However, project lead Jo Lorenz believes few who call Orchard Park their home - irrespective of age - see a strong link between improved quality of life and local democracy. ""They perhaps don't understand that voting, having a voice, helps to make a difference,"" says Jo. ""We know the more people who vote, the louder the voice of the community. Getting that point across is the challenge."" It is clear St Mike's, as it is known locally, is doing all it can to raise aspirations, but Jo admits political apathy, mixed with the belief that nothing will change, is rife. ""They feel they can't break the cycle,"" she says. ""If they feel they don't have a voice, they are going to think what's the point. ""We try to instil in them that they can achieve if they believe in themselves. But they also need to believe in other people too, and have that trust and relationship with them."" The vast majority of the ward is ranked among the lowest 10% of areas in the country on the Index of Multiple Deprivation, which measures levels including income, employment, education and crime. In 2022 despite Orchard Park returning three Labour councillors the party ceded control of the city to the Liberal Democrats for the first time since 2011, as they secured 29 seats to Labour's 27. With such a slender majority it is possible overall control could swing back, but all residents want is for whoever emerges victorious to fight their corner in the city's Guildhall. Jo, who has worked here 12 years, tells of what she sees as a widening gap between those who walk the corridors of power and ordinary people. ""There's definitely a disconnect between how people live their lives and how that is connected to the decisions that are made in the area,"" she says. ""There's possibly a feeling of loss of faith in those who represent them."" Jo also points out, for many people, putting a meal on the table will be the priority on 4 May, not casting a vote. ""Voting will not be top of the list,"" she adds. Opposite the centre is a parade of shops. I try to engage a shop manager in conversation about the election. ""Nah, not interested in that,"" is the response. Charlotte Lawler, 27, pushing a pram, tells me she may vote, depending on how her children are on the day. She is not alone, turnout in local elections is often low. Across England just 33.6% of people had their say in the 2022 elections, according to a report by the Electoral Commission. But while some cite a lack of time or being away on polling day Charlotte has a more damning appraisal of the situation in Orchard Park - ""People around here don't care about politics"". I ask her what she thinks is needed to reverse the apathy. ""We need more local people, people who have lived here their whole lives, to stand for election,"" she suggests. ""People who really understand what we are all going through."" She also believes more could be done in schools to promote local democracy. ""You don't go into it much at school,"" says Charlotte. ""You just get thrown into it [politics] when you're 18."" Even those who fully intend to vote appear pessimistic. ""I will be voting,"" says Thomas Hayward, 25, who studied politics at college. ""Even if it doesn't seem worth it."" I ask him what he means. ""There are problems with crime here and no-one does anything about it,"" he replies. Thomas feels he will be in a minority, certainly among his peers, casting his vote. ""I could show pictures of the candidates to my siblings and they wouldn't know who any of them were,"" he says. Paula Botterill, 56, shopping on her mobility scooter, has lived on the estate for 40 years. She says she has always voted and will return to the polling station in a few weeks' time. ""It's a couple of minutes out of your day,"" Paula tells me. She understands, though, why many choose not to use their vote. ""People around here feel they are not heard,"" she says. ""We need to be listened to more by the politicians."" Darren Aldridge, 47, and his friend Jennifer Scott, 67, say they are not frequent voters but both are planning to vote this time. ""People want more action and less words,"" says Darren. ""It's okay for them to say they will do this and do that but will they?"" The Orchard Park ward candidates are: Michael Gibbons (Lib Dem), Farhana Khan (Con), Kevin Paulson (Greens) and Gary Wareing (Lab).

Local Elections 2023: 'Politics is not something we talk about', ,934,uk,2023-04-22T00:09:50.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-65310441
Local elections 2023: Greens eye first council win in former Tory heartland," Woolpit in Suffolk has an intriguing legend. It tells of two children found near the village in the 12th Century. The big twist: they were both green. Now modern day Woolpit is part of a political battle that could see the district council, Mid Suffolk, turn a similar hue. The largely rural district with some traditional chocolate box villages and a heavy reliance on cars for transport and oil to heat homes might not seem the most obvious place for the Green party to target and win over. In elections in 2019, though, they more than doubled their seats on the council, from five to 12, and the Conservatives lost their majority. The Greens are now confident they can overtake the Conservatives to become the biggest party and, perhaps, even make history by winning an outright majority on a council for the first time in May's local elections. The Greens would need to win another six seats to win a majority; the Conservatives could take back control if they win two. One issue which appears to be benefitting the Greens politically is large-scale housing development because of concerns that the rural environment would be damaged. Opposite a carved wooden water pump, built to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, near to the old Post Office and nestling next to a pink half-timbered teashop, is the Woolpit Institute. In an upstairs room, decorated with tapestries depicting the village's evolution, 10 people in their sixties and seventies are politely, but competitively, playing one another at table tennis. Just down the road from the Institute, the diggers and earthmovers are out on a patch of land which will eventually add another 300 homes to the village. In between dodging stray ping pong balls, resident Paul Proctor and club founder Lynda Moore say large-scale housebuilding is a worry. Paul says: ""I think, with the sheer volume of building and the number of people that will be moving into the area, probably the main concern is about the facilities, can they cope?"" Lynda worries about losing what she describes as the ""wonderful community life"" of the village and thinks it will just mean more people commuting out. ""They haven't done anything about the road, which they need to. They haven't enlarged our school, where are all the children going to go? And what about jobs? There are no jobs in Woolpit."" She also voices concerns about losing agricultural land to solar farms. Suffolk has become something of a centre for energy infrastructure. So what else might be fuelling the Greens' hopes for a win in Mid Suffolk in particular? It's difficult to pin down one precise reason. In small villages, word gets around and at least some of their success seems to have been built on simply being visibly active in their local communities. They've had a presence on the council for 20 years and had gained a few more councillors at each subsequent election before 2019's overnight boost. This year, the Greens and the Conservatives are the only options on the ballot paper in more than a third of the seats up for election in Mid Suffolk, including Woolpit. That may help explain some of the confidence from the Greens, who often struggle to gain ground under the first-past-the-post system. The Lib Dems, Labour and Reform are standing candidates in some wards, including in Stowmarket, the district's biggest town. Among the handful of stalls in the centre of Stowmarket's Thursday market is one selling ""zero-waste"" products. It's just one sign of a generally heightened awareness of environmental issues, which may help the Greens. There's evidence too of disillusion with ""politics as usual"". In a pedestrian precinct backing on to a large supermarket is Zarkey's shoe repair shop and key cutters. Its owner Paul Zyrkos, has been on the site for nine years, and he says running the business at the moment is ""a bit up and down"". ""I'm coming into work every day wondering whether you're going to get the people through the door. Looking outside and seeing the footfall in this town just disappear completely is just very scary. ""I think the country's in a mess, but I would like someone who would come into this town and start to look at what they can do."" He, along with other traders, wants to see parking made free to encourage in more people. Helena, out walking her terrier Herbert, says the town centre is the ""worst it's been"" for empty shops in the almost 30 years she's lived in Stowmarket. ""It just seems to be a shame that there doesn't seem to be enough local business in the High Street to support the existing businesses that are here. If it was a tiny little town where people were just moving out, I could understand it... But it's not."" She acknowledges that it is the ""same in a lot of towns"". That's why the outcome of this election could be significant. The Greens often argue that one of the problems they face is that people don't vote for them because in some places they just don't think they can get elected. If they can win here, it is likely to give them more credibility as contenders in other areas of traditionally Conservative rural England. Recent visible successes have often come for them in cities such as Brighton & Hove, which they currently run as a minority administration and where Labour is pushing hard to take control. If they lose ground in Suffolk this time, though, they could miss out on their best chance to take a council in many years. With so many specific local issues in play, what a win could mean for their chances in a general election is much harder to predict.

Have the Conservatives increased council tax by 15%?," Labour tweeted about increases in council tax over the weekend. ""The Tories are raising council tax by up to 15%,"" it said. Some emphasis needs to be placed on the ""up to"" in that sentence. Only one council, Croydon, which has no party in overall control, has raised tax by 15%. The highest after that were two councils that raised it by 10%. These were Labour-controlled Slough and Conservative-controlled Thurrock. Croydon raised council tax by 15% after declaring bankruptcy because it realised it faced a £130m hole in its budget. Although the borough has an elected Conservative mayor, the Tories and Labour both have 34 councillors in total. The Green Party has two councillors and the Liberal Democrats one. The mayor has blamed ""the toxic debt and financial failures of the previous administration"" for the financial problems. These are partly due to the funding plans for the refurbishment of a concert hall. A report into the financial problems in Croydon found ""organisational dysfunction at the most senior level in the council"". The former leader of the council and its former cabinet member for finance, both of whom were Labour councillors, resigned from their roles as did its former chief executive. Labour councillors in Croydon have previously said that the government should be providing more funding instead of allowing the increase in council tax. They have also said the current administration inherited an underspend as well as a £27m reserve. The government increased the amount councils were allowed to raise taxes without a referendum to 5% - if they have social care responsibilities - in November's Autumn Statement. Croydon, Thurrock and Slough councils were given special permission by the government to raise their taxes by more without putting it to a vote. Thurrock, which is Conservative-controlled, is putting up council tax by 10% after declaring bankruptcy. Slough, which is Labour-run, is also putting council tax up 10% having declared bankruptcy in 2021 as a result of property and land investments. Labour also said in its campaign tweet that  Conservative councils charge £345 more than Labour ones. We asked Labour how it reached the figure but have not heard back.

Local elections 2023: What to expect from May's polls in England," May is a big month for the UK. There's the King's coronation on 6 May. A few days later, the music world will descend on Liverpool for Eurovision. And for political geeks like me there's another big date in the diary; the local elections on 4 May. Local elections are the biggest test of political opinion in England ahead of the next general election. More than 8,000 seats are up for grabs this time. The elections are about everything from potholes to council tax and how much we should all pay for local services. But the results will also give us a good idea of the lay of the political land. Are the Conservatives struggling? Is Labour gaining enough support to win the next general election? Are the Liberal Democrats about to eat into Tory heartlands in the south of England? Before we explore the answers, a bit of context. Local elections in the UK work on four-year cycles. Votes happen most years, but with different parts of the country taking part. The seats up for grabs this year are roughly the same as those that were up for grabs in May 2019. That was a bad period for the Conservatives, with the party engulfed in a civil war over Brexit. Labour was in a tough place too, with serious splits in the party over Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. This matters; because the number of seats lost and won this year will be in relation to a result which was pretty bad for the two biggest parties. The Conservatives don't have as far to fall - Labour are starting from a fairly low point and will want to make big gains. The Conservatives are braced for a bad set of results. Cabinet ministers have all been told to make three campaign visits to target areas. But senior figures in the party say they are likely to lose hundreds of seats - perhaps 1,000. There will be a bit of expectation management going on here (if you're expecting a REALLY ""bad result"", a result that's just ""bad"" doesn't feel like as big a blow). But the Tories are preparing for losses in places like Surrey, Herefordshire, Oxfordshire and beyond. Insiders working on the campaign accept many voters are unhappy with the party (particularly about the political turmoil last year) and will want to make that clear. Will that be a verdict on Rishi Sunak? In part, it has to be, because this is his first big electoral test as Conservative leader. But Tories are also arguing behind the scenes that the party is doing better on key issues like the economy, immigration and leadership. The Conservatives are preparing for a blow, but they'll argue it's not a fatal one. Labour thinks it has a good chance of forming the next government at Westminster - and it will want to show it has momentum. Labour strategists think the party's councillor tally will have to go up by hundreds to show it is on track. The big test for Labour, insiders say, will be whether they are making enough progress in areas where they need to pick up seats at a general election. Those they'll be watching closely include Swindon, Derby, Plymouth, Darlington, Thanet and Stoke-on-Trent. But there is some expectation management going on here too. Labour say they don't expect the result in May to mirror national opinion polls (which suggest the party is on course for power). That's because some key parts of the UK are not voting; London and Wales, where Labour does well, and Scotland, where it hopes to. The Liberal Democrats are firmly expecting gains too. They are targeting Conservative voters unhappy with the government at Westminster. Campaigners report finding former Tory members so disillusioned they are prepared to deliver leaflets for them. The Lib Dems are not going for subtlety in this campaign. At their launch, leader Sir Ed Davey drove a tractor through a wall of blue haybales; an in your face message that the party was targeting the ""Blue Wall' of Conservative-voting seats. The Blue Wall is mostly (though not exclusively) in the south of England; traditional Tory seats where the Lib Dems think voters want a change. They will be looking at May's results to see if they can take some scalps at a future general election; a lot of attention is being paid to Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab's constituency in Esher and Walton. The Lib Dems also have their sights set on gains in areas like Stratford-on- Avon (where Nadhim Zahawi is the local MP) and Wokingham (John Redwood). Interestingly, senior figures think voters have moved on from Brexit divisions. They believe former leave voters are now prepared to back the remain-supporting Lib Dems. The Greens have been picking up councillors in local elections in recent years - and are confident of keeping that trend going. Despite the 2019 result being extremely good for the party it thinks it can add another 100 or so seats this year. Green strategists say they are hoping to take seats from both the Conservatives and Labour - and perhaps win their first majority control of a council (Mid Suffolk). There are thousands of independent candidates standing too - and they are likely to form a significant part of the electoral map. They are often focused on specific issues in their area. That is another complicating factor when it comes to comparing local election results to general election projections. But the vote on 4 May will be closely watched. In communities where there is debate over big local issues. And in Westminster; where ministers and MPs will be wondering what it might all mean for their future.

Argentina dengue: Record fever outbreak kills over 40," Argentina is battling a record outbreak of dengue fever, which has killed more than 40 people and infected more than 60,000, mainly in the north-west. The infection is spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and the last big outbreak to hit Argentina was in 2020. The health ministry says dengue cases are starting to plateau, however. Biologists are irradiating thousands of male mosquitoes in labs, to be released later, in the hope that their offspring will be unviable because of DNA damage. ""This mosquito, due to the rise in temperature in our country and the world... is able to spread more. Their population keeps on moving further south,"" biologist Marianela Garcia Alba said, quoted by Reuters news agency. The aim is to make the mosquitoes that have been exposed to radiation the dominant type, to curb the spread of dengue, she added. The north-western provinces of Salta, Tucumán and Jujuy, near Argentina's borders with Chile and Bolivia, have recorded the highest numbers of deaths. Dengue symptoms include fever, headaches, nausea and aching joints. The health ministry has urged people to step up anti-mosquito measures, including mosquito netting on doorways and windows, use of insect repellent and removal of any water containers that may act as breeding grounds.

What comes next for the abortion pill in the US?," The US Supreme Court has decided to keep a commonly used abortion pill on the market while a lawsuit in a lower court continues. A Texas judge suspended approval of the abortion drug mifepristone on 7 April, questioning its safety. The ruling now returns to the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals for review. This means access to mifepristone remains unchanged - for now. Here's how we got here. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Texas suspended FDA's approval of the drug after a group of anti-abortion health professionals sued the agency alleging mifepristone was not safe. It was the first time in US history a court had bypassed the federal agency to rule on a drug's market approval. The pill - used in more than half of abortions in the US - was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000. The drug is also approved for use in several countries, including the UK and Canada. In his ruling, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said the FDA had rushed the approval and did not properly consider side effects. The FDA and several leading health organisations, such as the American Medical Association, say the drug is safe and effective. Minutes later, a federal judge in Washington state issued an opposing ruling, ordering the FDA to make no change to the drug's availability and preserving access to mifepristone in 17 US states and the District of Columbia. With these two rulings directly contradicting each other, the government appealed to the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. It also asked for the court to put the Texas order on hold while the appeal was heard, keeping mifepristone available. The appeals court agreed to keep the drug on the market - but with additional restrictions, such as only being available for use in the first seven weeks of pregnancy and requiring the drug to be dispensed in person by a physician. The restrictions also revoked the 2019 approval of the generic form of the drug. Mifepristone should stay on the market, the court ruled, because it was too late to challenge the 2000 approval. But it was not too late, it said, to challenge changes made to the approval after 2016 that significantly expanded access. Last week, the US justice department and Danco Laboratories, which manufactures the drug, called on the Supreme Court to intervene and strike down these restrictions while the appeal is being considered by the lower court. It argued that the status quo should be maintained, because changing the FDA's rules would ""create significant chaos for patients, prescribers, and the health care delivery system"". Last Friday, US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who oversees emergency matters for the 5th Circuit, ordered a temporary stay on the restrictions until Wednesday evening. On Wednesday afternoon, the Supreme Court further extended this deadline until Friday. This Friday, it issued a decision allowing the drug to remain on the market without any of the restrictions imposed by the lower courts. The Supreme Court - which has a 6-3 conservative majority - did not offer an explanation as to why. But two of the conservative judges - Justice Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas - dissented, which means they disagreed with the court's decision. In his written dissent, Justice Alito said ""at present, the applicants are not entitled to a stay because they have not shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the interim"". Access to the abortion pill mifepristone across the US will hinge on what happens during the lengthy appeals process. The Supreme Court's stay on the ban is valid until the appeals process ends. Right now, the case is being heard by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments for that appeal begin on 17 May. With the Washington and Texas court rulings in direct conflict with another, it is unclear which rule will apply. The FDA cannot both remove its approval, as instructed by the Texas court, and keep access to the drug, as instructed by the Washington court. Whichever way the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decides, it's likely that the other side will appeal to the Supreme Court. Legal experts say that the Supreme Court is expected to take it up because it has wide-reaching implications on national drug policy. Critics say that by overriding the FDA's approval, the court in Texas usurped the federal health agency's remit to regulate food, medicine, and medical devices. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 gives the FDA the authority to determine whether drugs are safe and effective. Typically, courts have deferred to the agency when it comes to scientific and medical decision-making. Legal experts warn the ruling opens the door for challenges to other approved medicines in the US and could also stifle development of future drugs. I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School professor, told BBC News the pharmaceutical industry could face more legal challenges, particularly to treatments that have become political flashpoints in the US, like transgender medical treatment and Covid-19 vaccines. ""It's possible in any space, but … it's going to trickle down in some ways and play out to be the worst for drugs that are needed sometimes by discrete and insular minorities,"" Prof Cohen said.

Woman's bowel cancer spotted by artificial intelligence," A woman who was part of a study using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect bowel cancer is free of the disease after it was found and removed. Jean Tyler, 75, from South Shields, took part in a study called Colo-Detect as part of a trial at 10 NHS Trusts. In the trial the AI flags up tissue potentially of concern to the medic carrying out the colonoscopy, which could be missed by the human eye. About 2,000 patients from 10 NHS trusts have been recruited for the trial. The AI detected a number of polyps and an area of cancer on Mrs Tyler's colonoscopy about a year ago after she agreed to be part of the trial. She then underwent surgery at South Tyneside District Hospital and has since recovered. ""I had fantastic support, it was unbelievable,"" she said. ""I had about seven or eight visits last year and I was so well looked after. ""I always say yes to these research projects because I know that they can make things a lot better for everybody."" Gastroenterology consultant Professor Colin Rees, based at Newcastle University, led the study alongside a team of colleagues working in South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust. The trial also includes North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, South Tees NHS Foundation Trust, Northumbria NHS Foundation Trust and Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Professor Rees described it as ""world-leading"" in improving detection, adding AI was likely to become ""a major tool used by medicine in the coming years"". The findings will studied to see how it can help save lives from bowel cancer - the second biggest killer cancer,  claiming around 16,800 lives a year in the UK. The results are expected to be published in the autumn. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to northeastandcumbria@bbc.co.uk.

Psychologist's death due to AstraZeneca Covid vaccine reaction - inquest," The death of a psychologist after his Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab was due to ""unintended complications of the vaccine"", an inquest has ruled. Stephen Wright, an NHS employee in south-east London, died 10 days after his first dose in January 2021, senior coroner Andrew Harris found. Dr Wright, 32, suffered a blood clot to the brain after receiving the vaccine. His wife Charlotte has been trying to get the ""natural causes"" wording on her husband's death certificate changed. She is pursuing legal action against the pharmaceutical company, along with dozens of other people. At London Inner South Coroner's Court, Mr Harris described it as a ""very unusual and deeply tragic case"". Dr Wright suffered from a combination of a brainstem infarction, bleed on the brain and ""vaccine-induced thrombosis"", the inquest heard. His condition rapidly worsened, but the nature of the bleed meant he was unfit for surgery. After the inquest, Mrs Wright, from Sevenoaks in Kent, said: ""It was made clear that Stephen was [previously] fit and healthy and that his death was by vaccination of AstraZeneca. For us, it allows us to be able to continue our litigation against AstraZeneca. This is the written proof."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, Mrs Wright agreed that some people had not been prepared to listen to her over how her husband had died. She said: ""Even with people in my life, there were questions and queries about whether I was actually telling the truth so, two years later, I can finally say it is the truth."" Dr Wright's mother, Anne Wright, revealed he had been due to start a job at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London the week after he died. She said: ""He loved his job, he loved the children he worked with, he loved the young people, and he had a real empathy with them and they really seemed to get on with him."" Speaking about the coroner's ruling, mother-of-two Charlotte Wright said: ""It provides relief but it doesn't provide closure. I think we're only going to get that when we have an answer from AstraZeneca and the government."" She added: ""I find it very comforting that I have two boys that remind me of him every day. I'm just very thankful that I got to marry such a great man and raise our boys in his honour."" When he outlined the facts of the case, senior coroner Mr Harris told the court it was ""very important to record as fact that it is the AstraZeneca vaccine - but that is different from blaming AstraZeneca"". He  added: ""It seems to me that there is not an action one can take at the moment."" Responding to the coroner's findings, an AstraZeneca (AZ) spokesman said ""the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects"". He added: ""We are very saddened by Stephen Wright's death and extend our deepest sympathies to his family for their loss. Patient safety is our highest priority and regulatory authorities have clear and stringent standards to ensure the safe use of all medicines, including vaccines."" Mrs Wright, who was on maternity leave when her husband died, said that before she received £120,000 from the government's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) in August, she had used food banks to help support her children, now aged nine and three. Up to 21 March, only 63 out of 4,178 claims received by the VDPS had led to payments, according to NHS figures. From May 2021, the AZ jab was no longer offered to adults under 40 after it became clear the vaccine carried an extremely rare risk of blood clots which could be fatal. Research into why that happens suggests a part of the AZ vaccine can trigger a complex chain reaction involving the immune system which can then result in clots developing in very rare circumstances. The UK medicines safety regulator, the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), continues to monitor the effects of the AZ vaccine as well as all other Covid vaccines. Side effects of the AZ jab can include changes to the heartbeat, shortness of breath and swelling of the lips, face or throat, according to the UK government. It estimates the vaccine programme prevented more than 100,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalisations from Covid during the first eight months of the rollout in 2021. According to a study in the Lancet, Covid vaccinations - many of which would have been AZ jabs - prevented 14 million deaths in 185 countries between December 2020 and December 2021. Out of more than 50 million first and second doses of the AZ vaccine administered, there have been 1,300 reports to the regulator of suspected deaths after taking the jab. The MHRA has always said that the benefits of any vaccines or medicines must outweigh their risks. Speaking to the BBC last year, Mrs Wright said of her husband: ""Being in the profession he was in, I truly believe that if he had been told all of the possible reactions, he would have still taken it [the vaccine] because I am aware it is a rare situation."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""More than 144 million Covid vaccines have been given in England, which has helped the country to live with Covid and saved thousands of lives. ""All vaccines being used in the UK have undergone robust clinical trials and have met the MHRA's strict standards of safety, effectiveness and quality. ""The vaccine damage payments scheme provides financial support to help ease the burden on individuals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, been severely disabled or died due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine.""

"Sudan conflict: 'We're expecting to get shot at any time,' doctor says"," A Sudanese doctor has told the BBC that he and his colleagues are ""expecting... to get shot [at] any time"" while working in a Khartoum hospital. The doctor, who we are not naming, has been volunteering to treat sick people, most of whom have been shot. He said he felt ""helpless"" and that it was ""difficult"" to ""see people in front of you... dying"". Both staff and patients at the hospital have been hit by stray bullets, he said. He will no longer return to that hospital because it is not safe, but instead will treat patients at a different medical facility. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) says 39 out of 59 hospitals in the capital, Khartoum, and nearby states are ""out of service"", highlighting the worsening humanitarian situation in the country. ""Among the hospitals that have stopped working, there are nine hospitals that were bombed, and 16 hospitals that were subjected to forced evacuation,"" the CCSD said. Fighting between the Sudanese army and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) group is now in its fifth day, amid a power struggle in the country. The doctor confirmed to the BBC that patients and doctors in at least 16 hospitals had been forcibly evacuated from hospitals by the RSF, although the BBC is not able to independently verify this report. Patients are stranded in some hospitals with no clean water or food, and it is difficult to evacuate them because of ""lack of transportation, the lack of safe passages and the lack of gasoline"". He also said that several corpses had been left in hospitals that cannot be accessed. A second medic, Dr Ahmed Abbas who is a coordinator for the Sudan Doctors' Union, told the BBC's Newshour radio programme that the ""situation is bad"" and that very few Khartoum hospitals were functioning. Those hospitals are struggling and ""running short of oxygen"" and life-saving drugs, while doctors have been working ""round the clock"" and are exhausted to the ""point of collapse"". Dr Abbas also warned that ""people are dying from lack of staff"" and blood supplies, while others were dying because of a ""long wait"" to get to the operating rooms, adding that the heath service was ""beyond collapse"". Both Dr Abbas and the unnamed Khartoum doctor told the BBC that some hospitals had been used by the factions as a refuge for their fighters. Dr Abbas said five major Khartoum hospitals had been almost totally destroyed by ""crossfire fighting"". On Wednesday the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called for unimpeded access in Sudan and warned that the fighting was taking a ""disastrous toll"". The body's regional director for Africa, Patrick Youssef, said the enormity of the situation was still unfolding. He called for ""quick access and safety for ambulances, medical personnel, and humanitarian actors to be able to evaluate what is happening"". An ICRC statement added that law and order had broken down in parts of the western region of Darfur, and that its offices in Nyala had been looted and a vehicle stolen. About 270 civilians have been killed since fighting broke out on Saturday, according to a statement from Western diplomats based in Khartoum. Large numbers of Khartoum residents have been fleeing, whilst others are trapped in their homes seeking shelter as a fresh wave of explosions erupted in the capital this morning. Later in the day, the Sudanese army and the RSF agreed a fresh 24-hour truce, however some gunfire could still be heard after 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT), when it was supposed to take effect.

"Cause of grey hair may be 'stuck' cells, say scientists"," US scientists believe they may have uncovered why hair turns grey as we age, citing pigment-making cells which lose the ability to mature. The arrested development impacts immature cells which would otherwise have developed into melanocytes which give hair its natural colour or shade. The team from New York University (NYU) studied the process in mice, which have identical cells for fur colour. They say the work could provide a basis for reversing the greying process. According to the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD), work on melanocytes might also help our understanding and treatment of certain cancers and other medical conditions too. We grow and shed hair all the time - it's a normal cycle that happens throughout life. New hair grows from hair follicles, found in the skin, where the pigment-producing melanocytes also reside. Melanocytes continuously decay and renew too. New ones are made from stem cells and it's these cells that the researchers believe become ""stuck"" in limbo in people whose hair has turned grey. NYU Langone Health team used special scans and lab techniques to study the cell-ageing process. As hair ages, sheds and then repeatedly grows back, increasing numbers of the melanocyte stem cells become sluggish at their job. The stem cells stop roaming around the follicle and become fixed, thereby failing to mature into fully-fledged melanocytes. With no pigment being produced, the hair turns grey, white or silver. ""Our study adds to our basic understanding of how melanocyte stem cells work to colour hair,"" study lead investigator Dr Qi Sun, a post-doctoral fellow at NYU Langone Health, told Nature journal. ""The newfound mechanisms raise the possibility that the same fixed-positioning of melanocyte stem cells may exist in humans. If so, it presents a potential pathway for reversing or preventing the greying."" It is not the first time scientists have suggested that greying hair might be a partially reversible process. Poor nutrition is one possible, treatable cause of premature greying. Some researchers claim stress might contribute to human hair turning white, and have suggested removing anxiety might restore the pigmentation process - at least for a while. Other research suggests genetics, or our DNA, partly determines when we go grey. While some prefer to hide grey hair with dye, others embrace it. Some even choose to get ahead of nature, and prematurely colour hair silver, white or grey. According to Glamour Magazine, silver hair is ""the spring hair colour trend that the cool girls are rocking"". ""We've spotted one shade, in particular, taking off. Oyster grey is the fresh, breezy, pearlescent colour trend that's cropping up all over Instagram,"" the article says. One hairstylist, Luke Hersheson, recently told British Vogue: ""At one point it was a big no-no to have grey hair, but now we don't equate grey hair with being 'old' - so many people are doing it. ""Post-lockdown, there is a feeling of liberty - many got into a grey hair rut because they couldn't see their colourists, but came out of the other side and actually enjoyed the change."" Experts advise against plucking out 'rogue' grey hairs. It won't stop the next one that grows from the same follicle from being grey. If you damage the hair follicle, it may be hard for new hair to grow, meaning you could be left with less hair or even bald patches. Dr Leila Asfour from the British Association of Dermatologists told the BBC work on hair colour was big business: ""The global hair colour market is projected to attain a value of $33.7bn by 2030. Clearly there's a demand. ""The obvious implication of this research, when it comes to the general public, is that it means being one step closer to finding a way to reverse our grey hairs. ""But this study's results help the medical field understand better other conditions where these stem cells may have a role - for example, understand the underlying nature of the deadliest skin cancer we treat called melanoma."" It might help with a medical condition called alopecia areata too, where the immune system attacks the hair and causes it to fall out. Sometimes the hair grows back white in these patients, she explained. And it could give more clues about vitiligo - a skin condition where patients develop white skin patches. Scientists have tried surgically placing hair follicles in the affected areas to help regenerate the colour from the pigment found in the hair follicle. ""More research is needed,"" Dr Asfour says. Dr Yusur Al-Nuaimi from the British Hair and Nail Society said scalp health was important for supporting good head hair growth, especially as we age. ""The recent study in mice adds to our understanding of the hair follicle and how the pigment-producing cells function. We are already discovering more about the potential of stem cell therapies for conditions including hair loss and studies such as this one, with new findings about the colour-producing cells, may lead to an array of future treatment options for our patients.""

What is the Marburg virus and how dangerous is it?," The Marburg virus has killed five people in north-west Tanzania. The highly-infectious disease is similar to Ebola, with symptoms including fever, muscle pains, diarrhoea, vomiting and, in some cases, death through extreme blood loss. Hundreds of people have died from the virus in recent years, almost all in Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), on average, the Marburg virus kills half of the people it infects, with previous outbreaks killing between 24% and 88% of patients. The virus was first identified in 1967 after 31 people were infected and seven died in simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and Belgrade in Serbia. The outbreak was traced to African green monkeys imported from Uganda. But the virus has since been linked to other animals. Among humans, it is spread mostly by people who have spent long periods in caves and mines populated by bats. In recent years, there have also been outbreaks of the Marburg virus in: A 2005 outbreak in Angola killed more than 300 people. However, in the rest of the world, only two people have died from the Marburg virus in the past 40 years - one person in Europe and one in the US. Both had been on expeditions to caves in Uganda. Five people have died in Tanzania's north-western Kagera region. Three other people are being treated in hospital and authorities are tracing 161 contacts. This follows an outbreak in Equatorial Guinea in February, which is known to have infected nine people and killed seven. The WHO is investigating 20 more probable cases there. Other major outbreaks include: The virus begins abruptly with: This is often followed, three days later, by: According to the WHO, ""the appearance of patients at this phase has been described as showing 'ghost-like' drawn features, deep-set eyes, expressionless faces and extreme lethargy."" Many people go on to bleed from various parts of the body, and some die eight to nine days after first falling ill, because of extreme loss of blood and shock. African green monkeys and pigs can carry it. The Egyptian rousette fruit bat often also harbours the virus. Among humans, it spreads through bodily fluids and contact with contaminated bedding. Even after people have recovered, their blood or semen can remain infectious for many months afterwards. There are no specific treatments or a vaccine for the virus. But a range of blood products, drug and immune therapies are being developed, the WHO says. Doctors may be able to alleviate the symptoms by giving hospital patients plenty of fluids and using transfusions to replace lost blood. People in Africa should avoid eating or handling bushmeat, according to Gavi, an international health organisation. People should also avoid contact with pigs in areas with an outbreak, says the WHO. Men who have had the virus should use condoms for a year after the onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative for the virus twice. Those who bury people who have died from the virus should also avoid touching the body. ",505,health,2023-03-23T11:18:43.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-62206270
Candida auris: What is the deadly fungus sweeping through US hospitals?," The drug-resistant fungus Candida auris (C. auris) was only discovered some 15 years ago but is already one of the world's most feared hospital microbes. If it gets inside the body, the yeast-type fungus can affect the bloodstream, the nervous system and several internal organs. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that its mortality rate ranges from 30% to 53% of patients affected by an invasive infection. What is more worrisome is that the fungus has proven to be resistant to the most common types of antifungal drugs. Some strains are resistant to all of the medicines we have, says BBC's health correspondent James Gallagher. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been outbreaks in more than 30 countries. A 2020 review from case reports from those nations found almost 4,750 cases globally between 2009 and 2019. The CDC said new data showed the fungus has ""spread at an alarming rate in US healthcare facilities"" in 2020 and 2021. Clinical cases in the country trebled - from 476 in 2019 to 1,471 in 2021. Also, a 2019 study by an international team of researchers suggested that rising temperatures linked to climate change may have played a role in the rising number of Candida auris infections. Here is everything you need to know about this deadly superbug. Candida auris (C. auris) is a yeast, a family of fungus which contains species pretty helpful to humans in activities such as bread-making and beer-brewing, but which also features species that cause infections in humans. One example is the very common Candida albicans, which causes thrush but also may trigger more severe infections. C. auris was first discovered in the ear canal of a patient at the Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital in 2009, which inspired its name (auris is Latin for ear). Most of the time, Candida yeasts live on our skin without causing problems, but they can cause infections if we are unwell or they get into the wrong place, like the bloodstream or the lungs. C. auris most frequently causes bloodstream infections, but it can also affect the respiratory system, the central nervous system and internal organs, as well as the skin. These infections are usually quite serious. The fungus is often resistant to the usual drugs, which makes infections difficult to treat. ""The biggest problem with this fungus is its resistance to the drugs we have,"" said Dr Tina Joshi, associate professor in Molecular Biology at the University of Plymouth, in the UK. ""But another issue is that identifying a C. auris infection is quite difficult and it can easily be mistaken for other fungi, leading to the wrong treatment."" This means that the patient might be ill for longer, or get worse before accessing the appropriate treatment. Transmission is mainly through contaminated surfaces in hospitals. It sticks to intravenous lines and blood pressure cuffs. It's really hard to clean off, according to Dr Neil Stone, leading fungal expert at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London. The solution is often to close off entire wards. ""It is the most worrying fungi and we ignore it at our peril,"" Dr Stone said. ""It could shut down entire healthcare systems."" In a statement issued on 20 March, the CDC said new data showed that the fungus has ""spread at an alarming rate"" in the US. It is unlikely that you will pick up a C. auris infection going about your daily life. However, the risk is higher if you are in a hospital for a long time or if you are in a nursing home, and patients who are in intensive care are much more likely to get a C. auris infection, according to the CDC. The risk of picking up an infection is also higher if you have been on antibiotics a lot, because the drugs also destroy good bacteria that can stop C. auris getting in. Resistance to the common antifungal drugs, like fluconazole, has been seen in the majority of C. auris strains. This means that these drugs do not work on C. auris. Because of this, less common antifungal drugs have been used to treat infections, but C. auris has now developed resistance to these, too. DNA evidence shows that the antifungal resistance genes in C. auris are very similar to those found in the very common C. albicans. This suggests that the resistance genes may have passed from one species to the other. A 2019 study, published by the journal mBio from the American Society for Microbiology, suggested that the reason C. auris infections have become so common may be because this species has been forced to live at higher temperatures because of climate change. Most fungi prefer the cooler temperatures found in soil. But, as global temperatures have risen, C. auris has been forced to adapt to higher temperatures. This may have made it easier for the fungus to thrive in the human body, which is warm at 36C to 37C. A better understanding of who is most at risk of contracting a C. auris infection is the first step towards reducing the number of infections. ""We are behind the curve in what concerns the study of fungi,"" Dr Joshi said. ""I am not surprised at all we are now having to catch-up with it."" Healthcare professionals need to know that people who spend long periods of time in hospitals or nursing homes or those who have a weakened immune system are at higher risk. Not all hospitals identify C. auris in the same way. They are sometimes mistaken for other fungal infections, like thrush, and the wrong treatment is given. Improving diagnosis will help to identify patients with C. auris earlier, which will mean that the right treatment is given - preventing the spread of infection to other patients. But above all, infection prevention efforts need to be improved, said Dr Joshi. ""The main measure is infection prevention and control, because we have already seen how difficult it is to tackle what it does to patients."" ""Hospitals need to be on top of disinfecting and cleaning."" Not quite. In its first-ever list of fungal ""priority pathogens"", published last October, the WHO named no less than 19 fungi that represent a great threat to public health. C. auris was one of four fungi to appear in the ""critical priority"" group, being described by the WHO as ""intrinsically resistant to most available antifungal medicines"".

More people could have hidden bowel condition," Many people may be suffering from an undiagnosed and misunderstood bowel condition, according to the charity Guts UK. Microscopic colitis is an inflammation of the large bowel and causes frequent watery diarrhoea, stomach pain, faecal incontinence, fatigue and weight loss. About 17,000 people are diagnosed each year in the UK, but experts say the real number is likely to be higher. Some standard tests for inflammatory bowel conditions do not spot it. But despite misdiagnoses, cases have risen in the UK in recent years. Victoria Rennison, 33, from South London, was diagnosed with microscopic colitis last year, after more than a decade of symptoms. She saw a number of specialists but was told she had irritable bowel syndrome and ""was left to get on with it"". When the condition was at its worst she would spend the entire day and many nights on the toilet, or running urgently to the bathroom. ""The diarrhoea would come on suddenly and would be profuse and watery and the pain was like intense cramps,"" said Victoria. ""There were even times my infant son had to sit on a bouncer in the bathroom with me for hours."" She told BBC News: ""I used to be sociable and outgoing but I found it harder and harder to go out. ""I didn't want to leave the house. I had to make a map of every toilet to do so."" Victoria was finally diagnosed after a gut specialist did a colonoscopy (camera test of her bowel) and - crucially - took biopsy samples of the inflamed bowel. On previous visits to doctors she had had colonoscopies, but no biopsy samples had been taken and the condition - which can be seen clearly when samples are put under a microscope - was missed. She says it was a huge relief to get a diagnosis and be given treatment. ""It was not possible to keep living like that with a small child. I feel like I've finally regained some semblance of normality."" Julie Harrington, CEO of Guts UK, said it was crucial to provide training for healthcare providers, and continue to raise awareness, and invest in research. She added: ""It is terribly sad that thousands of people are suffering with the debilitating symptoms of microscopic colitis. ""Most people with the condition can be easily treated with a course of gut-specific steroids or with symptom-relieving medicines, but getting a diagnosis is the first, essential step."" Prof Chris Probert, at the University of Liverpool, said: ""It is not clear why cases of the condition are on the increase, but it is likely to be due to a mixture of increased awareness of symptoms leading to more diagnoses, and environmental factors. ""The good news is that effective treatments are available, so people experiencing symptoms could benefit enormously by talking with their GP.""

Gel nails: Investigation launched into gel polish allergic reactions," The government is investigating reports that growing numbers of people are developing life-changing allergies to some gel nail products. Dermatologists say they are treating people for allergic reactions to acrylic and gel nails ""most weeks"". Dr Deirdre Buckley of the British Association of Dermatologists urged people to cut down on gel nail use and stick to ""old-fashioned"" polishes. She is now urging people to stop using DIY home kits to treat their nails. Some people have reported nails loosening or falling off, skin rashes or, in rarer cases, breathing difficulties, she said. On Friday, the government's Office for Product Safety and Standards confirmed it was investigating and said the first point of contact for anyone developing an allergy after using a polish is their local trading standards department. In a statement it said: ""All cosmetics made available in the UK must comply with strict safety laws. This includes a list of ingredients to enable consumers with allergies to identify products that may be unsuitable for them."" Although most gel polish manicures are safe and result in no problems, the British Association of Dermatologists is warning that the methacrylate chemicals - found in gel and acrylic nails - can cause allergic reactions in some people. It often occurs when gels and polishes are applied at home, or by untrained technicians. Dr Buckley - who co-authored a report about the issue in 2018 - told the BBC it was growing into ""a very serious and common problem"". ""We're seeing it more and more because more people are buying DIY kits, developing an allergy and then going to a salon, and the allergy gets worse."" She said in ""an ideal situation"", people would stop using gel nail polish and go back to old fashioned nail polishes, ""which are much less sensitising"". ""If people are determined to continue with acrylate nail products, they should get them done professionally,"" she added. Gel polish treatments have spiked in popularity over recent years because the polish is long-lasting. But unlike other nail polishes, gel varnish needs to be ""cured"" under a UV light to dry. However, the UV lamps that are purchased to dry the polish do not work with every type of gel. If a lamp is not at least 36 watts or the correct wavelength, the acrylates - a group of chemicals used to bond the gel - do not dry properly, penetrating the nail bed and surrounding skin, causing irritation and allergies. The allergies can leave sufferers unable to have medical treatments like white dental fillings, joint replacement surgery and some diabetes medications. This is because once a person is sensitised, the body will no longer tolerate anything containing acrylates. Dr Buckley said she saw one case where a woman had blistering over her hands and had to have several weeks off work. ""Another lady was doing home kits that she purchased herself. People don't realize they're going to become sensitized to something which has huge implications that have nothing to do with nails,"" she added. Lisa Prince started having problems when she was training to be a nail technician. She developed rashes and swelling all over her face, neck and body. ""We were taught nothing about chemical composition of the products we were using. My tutor just told me to wear gloves."" After tests, she was told she was allergic to acrylates. ""They told me I was allergic to acrylates and would have to let my dentist know because it would affect that,"" she said. ""And I would no longer be able to have joint replacements."" She said she was left in shock, saying: ""It's a scary thought. I've got really bad legs and hips. I know that some point I'm going to need surgery."" There are many other stories like Lisa's on social media. Nail technician Suzanne Clayton set up a group on Facebook when some of her clients started reacting to their gel manicures. ""I started the group so that nail techs had a place to talk about the problems we were seeing. Three days later, there was 700 people in the group. And I was like, what's going on? It was just crazy. And it's just exploded since then. It just keeps growing and growing and growing"". Four years on, the group now has in excess of 37,000 members, with reports of allergies from more than 100 countries. The first gel nail products were created in 2009 by the American firm Gelish. Their CEO Danny Hill says this surge in allergies is concerning. ""We try so hard to do all the things right - training, labelling, certification of the chemicals that we use.  Our products are EU compliant, and also US compliant. With internet sales, products are from countries that do not comply to those strict regulations, and can cause severe irritation to the skin."" ""We've sold close to 100-million bottles of gel polish around the world. And yes, there are cases when we do have some breakouts or allergies. But the numbers are very low."" Some nail technicians have also said the reactions are giving some in the industry cause for concern. Formulations of gel polishes do differ; some are more problematic than others. The founder of the Federation of Nail Professionals, Marian Newman, says gel manicures are safe, if you ask the right questions. She has seen ""lots"" of allergic reactions affecting customers and nail technicians, she said. She is also urging people to ditch their DIY kits. She told BBC News: ""People that buy DIY kits and do gel polish nails at home, please don't. What should be on the labels is that these products should be used by a professional only. ""Choose your nail professional wisely by their level of education, training and qualifications. Don't be shy to ask. They won't mind. And make sure they're using a range of products that have been made in the in Europe or in America. As long as you understand what to look for, it is safe."" She added: ""One of the most recognized allergens is an ingredient names Hema. To be safer find someone who uses a brand which is Hema-free, and there are plenty of them now. And, if possible, hypoallergenic."" If you have experienced adverse effects to gel nail polish, you can get in touch by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

"Cambridge University saw my son as a problem, says bereaved mum"," A bereaved mother said she believed Cambridge University wanted to move the ""problem"" on after her son developed mental health issues. Jo Ndisang said her son Jared was not given the option to take a break when he became unwell in his third year. He died a year later in 2019, aged 21, and his mother said universities should ""respond in a compassionate way to those who are struggling"". The university said ""nothing is more important"" than safety and wellbeing. An inquest this month found Mr Ndisang's death ""was caused by sudden cardiac death of undetermined cause"", leaving his mother with remaining questions. Ms Ndisang, from London, and is part of the Learn Network of bereaved families aiming to prevent future deaths. On Tuesday, she and other members are due to hand in a petition, signed by more than 128,000 people, to Downing Street, calling for the creation of a statutory duty of care for students in higher education. In March 2018, Ms Ndisang said she noticed her son, a natural sciences student at Christ's College, was not himself. When he went back to university for his exams, she said she would ring him each morning and night. But towards the end of May, he became very unwell and Ms Ndisang said she came to take him home. She said after this the university organised for her son to see a psychiatrist and had a meeting with his tutor, where Mr Ndisang asked if he could intermit, a term used for a break in studies. ""But it wasn't an option and they strongly encouraged Jared to graduate,"" she said, with her son being given an unclassified degree. ""That was how it went and that's not what Jared wanted. It was his dream to go to Cambridge and he'd worked so hard. And as you can imagine it just seemed to exacerbate the problem. ""So I spent the next months just convincing Jared 'your path's changed, it's not a problem, if you want to go back to university later, you can do that'. However, I think Jared just couldn't get past it."" Mrs Ndisang said ""no reason was given"" as to why intermission was refused ""but it was very clear intermitting was not an option"". ""I got the feeling like they wanted to move the 'problem' on,"" she said. She said she believed her son had five sessions of counselling at university. In 2021, the university's mental health services were found to be ""ineffective"", ""untargeted"" and ""unsustainable"" by a review it commissioned, despite being one ""of the biggest spenders on student mental health and wellbeing support in the sector"". Ms Ndisang believes that ""a student's mental health should be considered at every decision made, along their student journey"". Asked what she would like Cambridge to learn from her son's case, she said: ""Each student death has valuable lessons for higher education leaders. ""Each life is unique and each story is different but there is learning and we must insist on learning. ""We can't stop mental-ill health and we can't stop life events which impact on us all. But we can control our own actions and respond in a compassionate way to those who are struggling. ""There needs to be mechanisms and systems in place. There's an obvious problem. Over 100 students in higher education die each year and we just want to know what are our higher education leaders doing?"" Last year six Cambridge University students died by suicide or suspected suicide between March and September. In response to Ms Ndisang's comments, Cambridge's head of student support, Natalie Acton, said: ""Jared is remembered as an active and caring member of our community and our thoughts remain with his family and friends. ""Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our students and we have recently launched a new student mental health and wellbeing plan which includes swifter access to counselling, increased capacity in our support services and our Reach Out campaign to ensure students know where to find help. ""Like all universities we are exploring the best way to work with trusted contacts for each student. This process must strike a balance between protecting the privacy of our students and ensuring they have the right support."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We expect all universities to take active steps to prevent suicides. We are working closely with charities and the sector to promote and fund effective mental health support such as the free Student Space online service. ""We are committed to the wellbeing of students and our first ever student support champion, Edward Peck, has been speaking to bereaved parents to understand where further improvements can be made.""

"Child Trust Funds: Millions of pounds stuck in 80,000 accounts - report"," Tens of millions of pounds belonging to about 80,000 young people without capacity to make financial decisions could be locked in trust funds, a report suggests. Those families must go through court to access the savings when accounts mature - a process which can take months and cost hundreds of pounds. Only 15 accounts were accessed this way in 2021. The government says it is unable to share more recent figures. It says it is trying to speed up cases. One mum told BBC News she wishes she had never gone through the ""hugely stressful"" process, and has advised others against it. Michele Creed's dining room table is covered in documents, as she takes me through the year-long process of accessing her daughter Alana's savings account. ""I just can't believe I've had to do all this just to access the birthday money, Christmas money and other savings we've been putting away for her,"" she says. Like the millions of others born between 2002 and 2011, Alana was given between £250 and £500 through the then-Labour government's Child Trust Fund scheme. Families could then add their own contributions to help the savings pot grow. Alana now has £7,500 in her account. The 19-year-old has severe learning disabilities and lacks the capacity to make financial decisions. So, instead of being able to withdraw the money when she turned 18 like most of her peers, her family have had to spend nearly £750 going through the Court of Protection. Michele says it was so complicated she had to go through the court process twice - costing £371 in fees each time - to make sure both she and her husband could access her daughter's savings. It took a year in total. ""It's so frustrating. Her older sister was just able to get her money without a problem, but with Alana, there was this huge block that we had to fight to get past,"" Michele says. Michele is one of the few parents who has managed to withdraw her daughter's money through the Court of Protection. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures show only 15 accounts were accessed through the court process in 2021. Michele wishes she ""had never started"" the ""long, bureaucratic and expensive"" process to get Alana her money, and advises other families who may be about to go to court to think twice. ""If you can leave the money where it is, and hopefully things will change one day, I would do that because it changes everything."" When a parent or carer is granted access to their child's savings, the Court of Protection makes them a deputy of the child's financial affairs. This means Michele now has a lifelong legal duty to account for every penny she spends of her daughter's money. She says the ongoing scrutiny feels like a ""slur"" on her character, pointing to her pile of receipts and spreadsheets, which are evidence of how she is spending Alana's benefits and savings. ""For many years I have been trusted to manage Alana's disability benefits as her appointee. But now, because I have had to become a deputy, I'm not trusted to manage her money,"" she says. Alana loves going to Caffe Nero, so Michele sometimes spends £100 a month on going for coffees with her. ""It's her favourite thing to do, and now I feel like I've got to justify it."" A report by Renaissance Legal, a firm that supports families through the process, seen exclusively by BBC News, suggests there are more than 80,000 accounts that cannot be accessed without going through the Court of Protection. By 2029, the year in which all of these accounts will have matured, there could be up to £210m locked away in Child Trust Funds that families have been unable to access. Philip Warford, the firm's managing director, says in some cases young people have £75,000 worth of savings effectively locked away. ""Many of [these] families are fighting on all fronts, for the right education for their child, for the right amount in benefits, for better healthcare, and now they are fighting to get their own money back,"" he says. ""The financial risk posed by these families is zero - it's their money in the first place."" Laura Williams has been adding money to her 17-year-old son's account since he was born. But she has decided not to apply to access Joel's savings of £6,000 because she doesn't want to face the ""ordeal"" of the court case and becoming a deputy. Joel has Malan Syndrome, a rare chromosomal condition, and does not have capacity to make any decisions about his finances. Laura transferred his Child Trust Fund into a Junior ISA several years ago, but the same rules around accessing the money apply. ""It's so unfair. Just because my child has a disability, he is going to be the one to suffer,"" she says. Lord Blunkett told the BBC that ""mistakes were made"" by the Labour government that set up Child Trust Funds. He says he and his colleagues did not foresee how the Mental Capacity Act would make it difficult for families to access the money. ""But now we need to get a bit of common sense into the issue,"" he adds. ""These families are trusted to handle their children's benefits - government money - by the Department of Work and Pensions. They can be trusted with their own savings."" The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has previously considered proposals to change the process so families would not have to go to court. But in February, after a year long consultation, it decided to keep the process as it is, in order to ""protect against fraud and abuse"". The MoJ says it is simplifying the system to speed up the process. It added that most families who apply would get their fees waived but for some, if the account has more than £3,000, then it would be decided on a case-by-case basis. When Michele went through the process last year, she was told she would have to pay the court fees. Surrounded by her pile of receipts, she says becoming Alana's deputy has been hugely detrimental to their lives. ""Alana's savings were supposed to be something positive, but instead, what's come out of it is a life of feeling like we are being watched by Big Brother.""

University student complaints hit record high in England and Wales for fourth successive year," The number of student complaints about university courses in England and Wales reached a record high for a fourth year running, in 2022. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) received 2,850 complaints - 3% more than in 2021 - and £1,050,114 was awarded in compensation. There are around 2.5 million students in England and Wales, and Universities UK said most had positive experiences. Just under a quarter of the 2022 complaints related to the pandemic. That compared with more than a third of those received in 2021, although Covid still appears to be having an impact. The number of student complaints about academic appeals, including grades, made up 38% of the total - up from 29% in 2021. The rise comes after universities ended policies that protected students' grades from Covid disruption. ""No detriment"" or ""safety net"" policies introduced in 2020-21 often meant students' grades were based on their performance up until the pandemic. There were fewer appeals while they were in place, according to the OIA report. But many institutions ended them in 2021-22. Complaints about service issues, such as teaching, also represented 38% - although this was down from 45% in 2021. Lydia Pennell, 22, left Manchester Metropolitan University after her first year of a fashion design course, which she began in September 2020. She told the BBC that most of the teaching was online, so she missed out on time using the facilities. ""I didn't make a single garment during my first year. I didn't know how to sew, or how to use any of the machines in uni,"" she said. In one online workshop, she said students were asked to use wine bottles instead of mannequins, and dress them using paper and masking tape, rather than fabric. Miss Pennell complained to the OIA last year, having already complained to the university. None of the complaints were upheld. She said she was frustrated about the prospect of paying back her tuition fee loan for that year. ""It's disappointing to throw that much money away for an outcome that doesn't exist at all,"" she said. Manchester Metropolitan University said teaching took place online throughout national lockdowns, and in-person sessions were available when restrictions were not in place. A spokesman said it provided ""a wide range of practical support for students to work from home"", which included sewing machines for second and third-year fashion students, as well as ""mini mannequins"". Miss Pennell is among students who are seeking compensation from universities through the Student Group Claim over disruption to their education during Covid. Ryan Dunleavy of Harcus Parker, one of the law firms representing them, said: ""Some have now left university, feeling thoroughly disappointed about the subpar service they received, which in no way reflected what they had been promised by their universities. ""Those who are still on courses at their universities tend to feed back to us that how they are being taught is still not up to the standard that they were promised."" A quarter of complaints to the OIA in 2022 were classed as ""justified"" or ""partly justified"", or were settled in favour of the student. A group of more than 400 students received £640,000 in compensation. Felicity Mitchell, independent adjudicator at the OIA, said 2022 was ""another difficult year for students and providers"". ""We are seeing increasing levels of distress among students who are struggling to cope, and this is a major concern,"" she said. ""At the same time, the pressures on providers make it more difficult for them to support students effectively."" Universities will face ""soaring demand"" for places in the coming years, according to admissions service Ucas. The number of applicants could grow by 30% between 2022 and 2030, it said - reaching about one million by the start of the next decade. Strike action over pay, working conditions and pensions has been adding to pressure on universities in recent years. The OIA said only a ""small number of complaints"" related to industrial action last year. However, there has been more action this year, with university staff walking out again in February and March. A marking boycott has now started at more than 140 institutions, and further strike dates could be announced. A spokeswoman for Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, said the OIA report helped universities know ""how and where to improve"". She said most students had positive experiences, but that some dissatisfaction was ""inevitable"". ",734,education,2023-04-20T10:39:58.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-65324664
Thousands of children sharing beds due to overcrowding," More than two million children in England are living in overcrowded accommodation with little or no personal space, while some 300,000 share beds with family members, new analysis suggests. The BBC has spoken to two families struggling to cope because they do not have enough space. On the third floor of a large block of flats, Deni Reid squeezes into a small corner to practise her keyboard. Sitting about a foot away, her mother listens intently, proud not just of her daughter's musical talents, but also of her ability to overcome adversity. ""She's nearly 10 and she's never had her own bedroom,"" says Joanna Szablewska. ""She's always been sharing a bed with me."" The family pay £860 a month for what their local council deems to be a one-bedroom flat. In reality, it is a shower room, a tiny kitchen/sitting area and a room with a double bed ""about the same size as a prison cell"", says Joanna. They were told they would only be here for eight weeks but it has been 13 months. ""We deserve to have at least one single bed each and one wardrobe,"" says the 36-year-old administrator. ""She [Deni] would love to have a desk to do her homework, is that so much to ask for?"" In a letter to the council, pleading for a larger property, Deni wrote: ""I've been homeless my whole life. I deserve my own room, space and bed."" New National Housing Federation (NHF) analysis, published on Wednesday, suggests: Joanna and her daughter were forced to seek council help when private, rented accommodation became too expensive. Joanna had never been able to afford a two-bed property, but, with rents soaring, now struggles to afford a one-bed flat. They are currently one of 56 homeless families living in Brimstone House, in Stratford, east London. The tower block used to house single people in studio flats but is currently being used by Newham Council to provide temporary and emergency accommodation. Joanna works from home, so her daughter has to spend whole days, especially during school holidays, sitting on the bed. ""I can't have family over. I can't have a proper Easter, I can't have Christmas. My daughter doesn't have space to play. I barely have space to work. Living here is so depressing,"" says Joanna. Under pressure from a local housing action group, Focus E15, the mayor of Newham vowed last year to move all families out of the block by next month, but recently said the deadline would not be met. The council says there has been a 26% increase in homeless households needing help over the past year. Several families have told the BBC about the cramped conditions they live in: the claustrophobic nature of the rooms, the difficulties of keeping each property tidy and the stress of living in such close proximity to partners and children. Amira, 21 months, has never had a bath; she has spent her entire life in a small room in the building, says her mother. Nearby, three-year-old Ehvie loathes showers, constantly screaming. ""Because there is no bath, I use a bucket filled with water and put some toys in there - it's the closest I can come to replicating a bath,"" says her mum, 28-year-old student, Caitlin Rosenbrand. She too shares her bed with her daughter, but ""sometimes I have to sleep on the floor because she can take up the whole bed. If I wake her to scooch her up a little bit, it can be quite difficult for her to go back to sleep, which makes everything more stressful."" Households are considered overcrowded if more than two children under the age of 10, or two teenagers of different sexes, or two adults aged 16 or over - and not in a relationship, share a room. ""Every child deserves the right to have a home that is suitable for their needs and allows them to grow as individuals,"" said NHF chief executive Kate Henderson. ""Growing up in overcrowded homes can have a devastating impact on a child's self-esteem, wellbeing, and future life chances as well as affecting family relationships and making it harder for parents to nurture their child's growth."" The biggest cause of overcrowding, says the NHF, is a chronic shortage of social housing. Ministers say they are investing £11.5bn to deliver thousands of affordable homes, but campaigners say the change is too slow. Just a 10-minute walk from Brimstone House sits a picture of England's dysfunctional housing system. Plans to regenerate the Carpenters Estate were originally announced in 2003, residents were moved out of hundreds of council flats more than a decade ago. Today, the three tower blocks that dominate the estate stand dilapidated and virtually empty, windows smashed and moss growing around them, with those regeneration plans having continually changed over the years. The latest plans, say Newham council, will see more than 2,000 homes built, in phases, over the next two decades. The council also say they will acquire 500 homes over the next three years to tackle homelessness. As well as being a keen pianist, Deni is on a scheme for talented singers run by the Royal Opera House.

Dyscalculia: Do Rishi Sunak's maths plans add up for everyone?," The country has to get better at maths, Rishi Sunak told teachers and students in north London this week. Changing an ""anti-maths mindset"" was key to boosting long-term economic growth he said, and poor numeracy could be costing ""tens of billions a year"". For Peter Cherry, who struggled with maths at school, the implication of the PM's message was that people who are not good at maths should feel ""ashamed"". The 35-year-old from Sussex is among the 6% of people in the UK with dyscalculia, a learning difficulty which makes it harder to use and understand maths. National Numeracy, an organisation focused on adult and child numeracy, says the condition can make it harder for people to recognise numbers, place things in order, and learn sequences. Among Mr Sunak's proposals is the aim for students to continue maths education up to 18 in England. He plans to ask mathematicians and business people to review the ""core maths content"" taught in schools, and consider a new maths qualification. Mr Cherry excelled at school in Horsham, in West Sussex, but struggled with maths, taking classes in his school's special education centre. While he failed maths GCSE multiple times, he received funding for a PhD in comparative literature with the University of Edinburgh, and speaks Turkish and French. After several years working in Turkey, he spent some of 2021 and 2022 on universal credit in the UK, struggling to find work because he did not have a GCSE in maths. In his speech, the prime minister said the value of maths was often overlooked and poor attainment was regarded as ""socially acceptable"". ""The implication really strongly was that if you are not good at maths for some reason, this is something you should be ashamed of,"" said Peter about the PM's message. ""This is a deeply, profoundly offensive message to be sending to someone like me."" He said no-one was arguing with the notion that maths education should be improved, but he did not think Mr Sunak knew what dyscalculia was. Mr Cherry, who now volunteers with the Dyscalculia Network and sits on the board of its adult advisory group, said it had been contacted by concerned parents following the announcement. ""[If I was in school now] this would have been the end of me. I would have just felt that my future was over,"" he said. ""I think we really need a national conversation on dyscalculia."" The BBC has asked the Cabinet Office to comment. For Alice Tarbuck, who has three humanities degrees, her first thought after the announcement was that it felt like a push by the government to ""flatten the desired skillset of our young people"". The 35-year-old writer and academic from Edinburgh was diagnosed with dyscalculia at school when it became clear she was performing worse in maths than other subjects. Dyscalculia for her meant ""numbers do not fall into patterns"" the way they did for others, she said. However her diagnosis freed her from feelings of shame, she said, and the sense ""maybe I was secretly stupid"". Ms Tarbuck dropped maths as soon as she could at Scottish standard level (which was the equivalent to GCSE level). Had she been made to continue maths to 18, she believes it would have ""considerably reduced her chances"" of getting the grades needed for her university of choice. While she supports people being educated in practical applications for maths, for her the idea of making it compulsory to 18 is nonsense. She believes the government's plans are an ""attempt to woo voters of a certain age who think everyone should still learn Latin by rote and stand up when teachers come into the classroom"". Personal finance expert Iona Bain was also diagnosed with the condition while at school. She was educated in the Scottish system, and currently lives in London. She said she was lucky to get the right support, but some pupils might be trying ""really, really hard"" to do their ""absolute best in maths"", but something is still not clicking. ""I was very keen to drop maths as soon as I could,"" she said. ""I continued to have this very difficult relationship with maths for many years... [struggling] with numbers in the same way some people struggle with words. I would like to see it acknowledged in a similar way."" A financial expert on BBC One's Morning Live, much of Ms Bain's work involves writing and broadcasting about money - which may seem an unlikely career choice for someone with dyscalculia. ""Money is not just about doing the sums,"" she said. ""You need to understand your habits and psychology, all of these things that are really fascinating."" She does agree that ""as a country we need to be more competent with numbers"". ""I think if we start setting goals and benchmarks that are unrealistic, there is a risk that you compound the problem and discourage young people,"" she said. ""It's a great idea that everybody should leave school feeling confident with maths,"" said Paul Milner, an expert in dyscalculia with National Numeracy. This did not necessarily mean continuing a GSCE-type level of teaching until 18, he added. The government's intention was good, he said, and it would be ""brilliant"" if it led to the right support being put in place for people. ""It is all different wiring, and different strengths and weaknesses,"" he said. While dyscalculia was an issue for many, having confidence with numbers was a wider issue that affected about a third of the population, said Mr Milner. ""The big problem is we don't talk about it, because people who struggle don't talk about it. ""They leave school and say 'oh, I'm not a maths person'. And then people go on and find a coping mechanism."" For Ms Bain the key could be looking at maths in a more practical way, and how it applies to finance. ""I have lost count of the number of people who say they wish they had learnt about mortgages rather than trigonometry,"" she said. ""There are things you can do to improve your situation. It does not mean you are doomed to be completely chaotic with your money. There is still a lot of misunderstanding about dyscalculia.""

SpaceX Starship: Elon Musk promises second launch within months," Elon Musk's SpaceX company's mammoth new rocket, Starship, has exploded on its maiden flight. No-one was hurt in the uncrewed test that lifted off from Texas' coast on Thursday morning local time. After two to three minutes into the flight, the rocket - the biggest ever developed - started to tumble out of control and was soon destroyed by onboard charges. Mr Musk has said his company will try again in a couple of months. SpaceX engineers still class Thursday's mission as a success. They like to ""test early and often"" and are not afraid to break things. They will have gathered a mass of data to work towards the next flight. A second Starship is almost ready to take flight. ""Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months,"" Mr Musk tweeted. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses rocket launches in the US, said it would oversee a mishap investigation. A spokesman said this was standard practice when a vehicle was lost in flight. The entrepreneur had tried to temper expectations before the launch. Just getting the vehicle off the ground and not destroying the launch pad infrastructure would be considered ""a win"", he said. His wish was granted. Starship cleared its launch complex on the US-Mexico border and picked up pace as it headed out over the Gulf of Mexico. But it was evident within a minute or so that not everything was going to plan. As the rocket climbed higher and higher, it could be seen that six of the 33 engines at the base of the vehicle had been shut down or had flamed out. And three minutes into the flight, it was pretty obvious the end was near. When the two halves of the vehicle should have been separating, they were in fact still connected - and veering off course. At launch-plus-four-minutes, as Starship was losing altitude, a large explosion ripped across the blue sky, the result of computers triggering the vehicle's Flight Termination System (FTS). ""With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship,"" SpaceX said in a statement. The top segment of Starship, also known as the ship, had taken flight previously on short hops, but this was the first time it had launched with its lower-stage. This immense booster, called simply Super Heavy, was fired while clamped to its launch mount in February. However, its cluster of engines on that occasion were throttled back to half their capability. If, as promised, SpaceX went for 90% thrust on Thursday, the stage should have delivered something close to 70 meganewtons. That's double the thrust put out by the Saturn V rocket that famously sent men to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s. Starship may not have destroyed its launch pad but later pictures indicated the forceful departure had done a fair amount of damage to concrete surfaces. The plan for the mission had been to send the ship on one near-complete revolution of the Earth, ending with a splashdown in the Pacific, a couple of hundred km north of Hawaii. There was no expectation that the ship or Super Heavy would be recovered. However, long term, this is the plan. The idea is to land both halves, refuel them and launch again - over and over. If this can be achieved, it will be transformative. Starship has a prospective payload performance to orbit of more than 100 tonnes per flight. When this is allied to the low cost of operation - principally, just the cost of fuel - it should open the door to an exciting future. ""In the industry, there's certainly a very high expectation at the potential of this vehicle for disruption,"" said space consultant Carissa Bryce Christensen. ""Its massive capacity, from a commercial standpoint, could be significant. A very large vehicle that's human-rated could be important for the emergence of space tourism. The other element is the vehicle being inexpensive. So, you've got a vehicle with two transformational aspects - massive capacity and, potentially, at a very low price,"" the CEO of BryceTech told BBC News. The entrepreneur will initially use Starship to launch thousands more satellites for his broadband internet constellation in the sky - Starlink. Only when engineers are confident in the vehicle's reliability will they permit people to fly on the rocket. The first mission has already been lined up. It will be commanded by billionaire US businessman and fast-jet pilot Jared Isaacman. He's already flown to space in a SpaceX Dragon capsule. The first flight around the Moon will be conducted by Japanese retail fashion billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. He will take eight artists with him as part of his DearMoon project. The US space agency, Nasa, wants to use a version of Starship to land its astronauts on the Moon's surface.

Northern elephant seals sleep in the deep to avoid predators," Northern elephant seals sleep while drifting hundreds of metres below the sea surface - at depths where their predators do not usually lurk. US researchers tracked the animals, recording their brain activity as the seals swam for thousands of kilometres. The mammals, which reach depths of up to 2,500ft (760m), sleep for only two hours per day in what the researchers describe as ""nap-like sleeping dives"". The findings are published in the journal Science. University of California Santa Cruz researcher Jessica Kendall-Bar and colleagues developed a non-invasive stick-on tag to track and simultaneously monitor the brain activity of wild northern elephant seals off the coast of California. They followed eight wild mammals on their foraging trips, which lasted about seven months and spanned more than 6,200 miles. They recorded the animals' brain activity, heart rate, movement and body position. ""We developed a scientific 'signature for sleep' by studying their behaviour and physiology for many years,"" explained Ritika Mukherji from the University of Oxford, who was involved in the study. It revealed that, at depths of more than 984ft, the seals would fall asleep and descend in what the scientists describe as ""sleep spirals"" for about 20 minutes at a time. ""They look like falling leaves,"" said Ms Mukherji. Lead researcher Prof Terrie Williams, from UC Santa Cruz, told BBC News: ""The thing I find remarkable is that any mammal would fall asleep while drifting hundreds of metres below the water surface. ""This is not light sleep but real paralytic, deep sleep that would have humans snoring. Remarkably, the seal's brain reliably wakes them out of it before running out of oxygen. ""Imagine waking up on the bottom of a pool - it sends a shiver down the spine."" The scientists say their study has drawn ""nap maps"" for seals - suggesting that sleeping areas may be as important as active hunting areas for these animals. Ms Mukherji explained: ""It shows us what their world looks like and helps us to understand what they're doing and when they're doing it, so we can understand how to avoid getting in their way.""

'Extinct' lion spotted in Chad national park," A lion has been spotted in Chad's Sena Oura National Park, where the big cats have not been seen since 2004 and were believed to be extinct until now. A photo of a lioness was released by a team of conservationists from the Chad government and the New-York based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). ""The photo shows a prime, very healthy adult lioness, around five years old,"" WCS Big Cat Programme executive director Luke Hunter told the BBC. ""I am sure she is not alone,"" he said. The image - taken by a remote camera in the protected area back in February - was released on Thursday. ""This is hugely encouraging because prime females are the foundation of any lion population, and they are not big wanderers: they inhabit areas that have prey and are safe to raise their cubs in,"" said Dr Hunter. He added that her presence was an early sign of lions recovering in an adjacent national park in Cameroon. In 2014, the authoritative International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species concluded that lions were extinct in Sena Oura. The WCS says that the region ""saw a period of ruthless, organised poaching more than a decade ago, but has since benefitted from a very strong commitment to conservation by the governments of both Cameroon and Chad"". ""This has produced better protection of the national parks and wildlife populations are now starting to recover,"" the organisation adds. Dr Hunter says that there are about 22,000-24,000 lions left in the wild, the vast majority of which are classified as the southern lion sub-species native to east and southern Africa. There are fewer than 1,000 northern lions in west and central Africa, and they are ""especially endangered and precious"", he adds.

Heatwave: Is India ready to deal with extreme temperatures?," In his best-selling 2020 novel, The Ministry for the Future, science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson opens with a deadly heatwave in India which kills millions of people. The sky blazes like an ""atomic bomb"", the heat from it is a ""slap in the face"", the eyes sting and ""everything was tan and beige and a brilliant, unbearable white"". Water doesn't help because it is ""hot as a bath… worse than the air"". People die ""faster than ever"". Mr Robinson's dystopian tale about global heating might be a horror fantasy of sorts, but it is also a chilling warning. Earlier this week, 12 people died from heatstroke and many others were admitted to hospital after attending a government-sponsored event in an open ground under a blazing sun in Navi Mumbai in India's Maharashtra state. India is one of the countries most exposed and vulnerable to heat. Hot days and hot night events have risen significantly, and are projected to increase between two and four-fold by 2050. Heatwaves are also predicted to arrive earlier, stay longer and become more frequent. The weather office has predicted above-average temperatures and heatwaves until the end of May. Average temperatures in India have risen by around 0.7% between 1901 and 2018, partly due to climate change. Heatwaves killed more than 22,000 people between 1992 and 2015, according to official figures. Experts reckon the actual toll would be much higher. Yet, the country really ""hasn't understood the importance of heat and how heat can kill"", says Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Gujarat-based Indian Institute of Public Health. ""This is partly because we don't compile our mortality data properly."" Prof Mavalankar should know. In May 2010, he found that the city of Ahmedabad had recorded 800 all-cause excess deaths - a measure of how many more people are dying than expected, compared to the previous few years - during a sweltering week of record-breaking temperatures. It was clear, he said, that heat was killing a lot of people. He said researchers compared the total number of deaths in the city to the maximum temperature recorded on the day, and laid down three colour coded alerts, with the red warning triggering above 45C. Prodded by these findings, Prof Mavalankar helped put together India's first heat action plan for the city of Ahmedabad. The plan kicked off in 2013 and advocated simple solutions like staying indoors, drinking lots of water before stepping out, and going to the hospital emergency if one felt sick. By 2018, he says, deaths from all causes had declined by a third in the hot, dry city. But the bad news is India's heat action plans don't seem to be working very well. (It is unclear whether the authorities in Navi Mumbai had a heat action plan in place when a million people reportedly were allowed to gather under the open sky.) A new study of 37 heat action plans at the city, district and state levels by Aditya Valiathan Pillai and Tamanna Dalal of Centre for Policy Research, a think-tank, found a lot of shortcomings. For one, most of the plans were not ""built for local context and have an oversimplified view of the hazards"". Only 10 of the 37 plans studied seem to establish locally defined temperature thresholds, although it was unclear whether they took factors like humidity into account while declaring a heatwave. ""We recommend nuancing and localising the heat hazard definition by including climate projections,"" Mr Pillai told me. One way to do it is to have more automated weather stations at village levels, according to Prof Mavalankar. Second, the researchers found that nearly all the plans were poor at ""identifying and targeting vulnerable groups"". Farm and construction workers who toil in the open, pregnant women, the elderly, and children were most vulnerable to heat. Some three-fourths of India's workers work in heat-exposed jobs like construction and mining. ""Workers are losing the ability to safely and efficiently work outside as the planet warms. It's becoming too hot and humid for them to cool themselves enough when they generate a large amount of body heat when conducting heavy labour,"" says climate researcher Luke Parsons of Duke University, North Carolina. This becomes worse during heatwaves as there are fewer safe and productive work hours during the day, he adds. Mr Pillai says that India needs ""granular understanding of which neighbourhoods have most people working in jobs where they are exposed to heat and whether they could afford to buy a cooler or afford to skip work"". He adds: ""You might have a situation where 3% of the area of the city contained 80% of the vulnerable population."" Also most of the heat action plans seem to be underfunded, had weak legal foundations with scant accountability, and were not sufficiently transparent, Mr Pillai and Ms Dalal found. Heatwave solutions can often be simple - planting enough trees in extremely exposed and hot areas or using design choices to reduce heat gain and increase heat loss in buildings. Sometimes simple surveillance solutions such as moving patients from a baking top floor to a lower floor of a non-airconditioned hospital can protect lives, as a study in Ahmedabad found. Having worker protections in place to stop or slow work if it is too hot can help so people don't feel the need to keep working at high intensity when it's not safe, says Mr Parsons. India saw a 55% rise in deaths due to extreme heat between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, a recent study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found. Exposure to heat also caused a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours among Indians in 2021, resulting in loss of incomes equivalent to about 5.4% of the country's GDP. But clearly, Indians are still not taking heat seriously enough. According to reports, the place in Navi Mumbai where the government ceremony had taken place had recorded a maximum temperature of 38C (100F) on Sunday. Yet, photos of the event showed thousands sitting directly under the sun with no roof or covering to offer shelter. Only a few carried umbrellas, or wrapped towels on their heads. ""I live in Delhi where the temperature can touch 50C and I see very few people even bring out their umbrellas,"" Mr Pillai says. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

UN climate report: Scientists release 'survival guide' to avert climate disaster," UN chief Antonio Guterres says a major new report on climate change is a ""survival guide for humanity"". Clean energy and technology can be exploited to avoid the growing climate disaster, the report says. But at a meeting in Switzerland to agree their findings, climate scientists warned a key global temperature goal will likely be missed. Their report lays out how rapid cuts to fossil fuels can avert the worst effects of climate change. In response to the findings, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres says that all countries should bring forward their net zero plans by a decade. These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere. ""There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,"" the report states. Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s. The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must ""work towards far more ambitious climate commitments"" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November. ""The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,"" a spokesperson said. Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: ""While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action."" The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved. Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made. Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. ""Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,"" the report states. ""If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,"" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News. ""And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying."" The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. ""There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,"" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News. ""The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target."" The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a ""temporary overshoot"". The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed. Some observers have their doubts. ""We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,"" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session. Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. ""Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,"" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.

Claude Lorius: Pioneering French climate change scientist dies aged 91," Claude Lorius, a leading glaciologist whose expeditions helped prove that humans were responsible for global warming, has died at the age of 91. He led 22 expeditions to Greenland and Antarctica during his lifetime. It was during one trip to Antarctica in 1965 where an evening of whiskey with ice cubes led him to prove humankind's role in the heating of the Earth's surface. Lorius died on Tuesday morning in the French region of Burgundy. It was his love of adventure which set him on the path to identifying and predicting an impending catastrophe for the planet. In 1956, just out of university, he joined an expedition to Antarctica. Temperatures there were as low as -40C (-40F). Despite this, Lorius and two other people lived there for two years, surviving with limited supplies and a faulty radio. The more polar expeditions he led to the continent, the more he became fascinated with Antarctica's mysteries. In 1965, Lorius had a revelation by gathering ice samples and dropping them in whiskey. He spoke about it half a century later. ""One evening, after deep drilling, in our caravan we drank a glass of whiskey in which we had put ice cubes of old ice,"" he said. ""Seeing the bubbles of air sparkling in our glasses, I came to the idea that they were samples of the atmosphere trapped in the ice."" Realising the scientific potential of analysing trapped air, he then decided to study ice cores - samples drilled out of the ice which act as frozen time capsules. By drilling into the ice, Lorius drilled into the past, penetrating, in his words, the ""ice of the first Ice Age"". His research into air bubbles trapped in the ice was published in 1987. It showed that for long periods levels of carbon dioxide varied slightly but after the Industrial Revolution concentrations of the greenhouse gas had rocketed as temperatures rose. Lorius's research brought him international renown and allowed scientists to look back over 160,000 years' worth of glacial records. The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) said it left ""no room for doubt"" that global warming was due to man made pollution. From then on he became a campaigner and in 1988 he was the inaugural expert of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 2002, he was awarded the CNRS gold medal along with his colleague Jean Jouzel. Lorius was also the first Frenchmen to receive the prestigious Blue Planet Prize.

UN warns against 'vampiric' global water use," A United Nations report has warned of a looming global water crisis and an ""imminent risk"" of shortages due to overconsumption and climate change. The world is ""blindly travelling a dangerous path"" of ""vampiric overconsumption and overdevelopment"", the report says. Its publication comes before the first major UN water summit since 1977. Thousands of delegates will attend the three-day gathering in New York which begins on Wednesday. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says water, ""humanity's lifeblood"", is being drained by ""unsustainable water use, pollution and unchecked global warming"". The report, published by UN Water and Unesco, warns that ""scarcity is becoming endemic"" because of overconsumption and pollution, while global warming will increase seasonal water shortages in both areas with abundant water and those already strained. Richard Connor, the lead author of the report, said that about 10% of the global population ""currently lives in areas that are high or critical water stress"". ""In our report, we say that up to 3.5 billion people live under conditions of water stress at least one month a year,"" he told the BBC. According to the most recent UN climate report, published Monday by the IPCC expert panel, ""roughly half of the world's population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least part of the year"". Mr Connor told reporters that ""uncertainties are increasing"" when it comes to global water supply. ""If we don't address it, there definitely will be a global crisis,"" he said. UNDP Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari told the BBC that resources would need to be managed more carefully in the future. ""There is enough water on the planet if we manage it more effectively than we have managed it over the last few decades,"" she said. ""I think we will have to find new governance models, new finance models, new models of using water and reusing water than ever before. I think that technology and innovation will play a very large role in looking at how to manage the water sector and the use of water.""

What is Elon Musk's Starship space vehicle?," Elon Musk is developing a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet. Mr Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX tried to get Starship airborne on Monday, April 17 but postponed the launch because of a pressurisation issue. SpaceX could try to launch again later this week. This article takes an in-depth look at the project. The founding ethos of SpaceX was to make life multi-planetary. He says that settling humans on other worlds, such as Mars, could preserve civilisation if Earth were to experience a cataclysm, such as a large asteroid impact. ""History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event,"" Musk said in 2016. ""The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go."" The SpaceX founder has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars. He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining. Realising this dream requires a vehicle that's up to the task. Starship is a rocket and spacecraft combination that could ferry more than 100 people a time to the Red Planet. The system is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. Being fully reusable means the principal hardware elements are not discarded in the sea or allowed to burn up, as happens with some other launch systems, but return to the ground so they can be flown again. Rapid reusability means that after coming back from space, Starship can be re-filled with propellant and be ready to launch again in a short period of time - like an aircraft. This reduces the cost of the whole enterprise. At launch, the spacecraft, called Starship, will sit atop a rocket called Super Heavy. The combined system will stand 120m (394ft) -tall and is also referred to as Starship. Let's take the spacecraft first. With its nosecone and landing fins, the stainless-steel vehicle resembles the rocket-ships from the golden age of science fiction. At the rear of the 50m (160ft) -long craft are six highly efficient Raptor engines, developed over the course of a decade by SpaceX. The combustion takes place in stages, and the engine's design cuts the amount of propellant that's wasted. Towards the middle of the vehicle are the propellant tanks. These feed liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (O2) to the Raptors. Methane is the fuel and oxygen acts as an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. The combination is dubbed methalox. The choice of fuel is unusual for rocket engines, but methane can generate plenty of thrust. It's also a prudent choice in light of Musk's designs on Mars. The SpaceX founder says that CH4 could be synthesised from Martian subsurface water and from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using a chemical process known as the Sabatier reaction. Re-fuelling Starship for the return trip to Earth using Martian resources would confer a level of self-sufficiency, making journeys both more feasible and cost-effective. Towards the front of the spacecraft - which is sometimes referred to as the upper stage - is a huge payload compartment that will be able to haul large cargo or people to destinations in deep space. Now, let's turn to the rocket. Measuring 70m (230ft) -long, Super Heavy will be filled with cryogenic (chilled) methalox. It will be powered by around 33 Raptor engines (this specification has changed several times) and should achieve more than 70 Meganewtons (16 million lbs) of maximum thrust. It should be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload, and possibly as much as 150 tonnes, to low-Earth orbit. This will make Super Heavy more powerful than the immense Saturn V launcher used for the Apollo Moon missions in the 1960s and 70s. As it ascends from the launch pad, the combined Starship system will begin to pitch over towards the intended orbit. When the upper stage separates in space, Super Heavy flips over while falling back towards Earth. Steel structures called ""grid fins"" attached to the sides of the booster, will help steer the rocket stage back towards its launch pad so it can be flown again. SpaceX has an ambitious plan to then catch the falling booster using its launch tower. This tower provides engineers and crew members with access to the spacecraft and rocket while they are sitting on the pad before launch. A pair of steel arms will extend out from the launch tower. The spent booster falls onto these arms. The tower has been dubbed ""Mechazilla"" because of its resemblance to a creature from the Godzilla movies. Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage could be inserted into a ""parking orbit"" after separation, allowing it to be re-filled with propellant. ""If you just fly [Starship] to orbit and don't do any refilling, it's pretty good — you'll get 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, and have no fuel to go anywhere else,"" Musk explained in 2017. ""If you send up tankers and re-fill in orbit, you could re-fill the tanks up all the way to the top, and get 150 tonnes [of payload] all the way to Mars."" To re-fuel, the spacecraft would dock with another Starship - already circling the Earth - that acts solely as a propellant depot. For long-haul trips to Mars and back - which could take up to nine months each way - Musk is looking to install around 40 cabins in the payload area near the front of the upper stage. ""You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,"" Musk said. The payload bay would also host common areas, storage space, a galley and a shelter where people could gather to shield from solar storms, where the Sun belches out harmful charged particles into space. Starship will also play a key role in Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In April 2021, the US space agency awarded SpaceX with a $2.89bn contract to develop Starship into a lander capable of delivering astronauts to the lunar surface this decade. The version tailored for Artemis flights would not possess the heat shield or flaps that are necessary for a return journey to Earth. Instead, the Starship Human Landing System would remain in space after its initial launch from Earth, so that it could eventually be used for multiple trips between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface. The uncrewed, or cargo, version of Starship features a payload bay that opens up like the mouth of a crocodile. This would allow it to be used for launching satellites. SpaceX says the huge payload capacity opens up possibilities for new types of robotic science mission, including telescopes larger than the James Webb observatory - the successor to Hubble which launched in December 2021. The system could also be used for space tourism: Elon Musk has promised a trip around the Moon in 2023 to the Japanese online retail billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. It could also carry out high-speed journeys between different destinations on Earth. Musk says that Starship could eventually carry people to destinations in the ""greater Solar System"", including gas giants such as Jupiter. But this remains a long-term objective. In order to bring other spacecraft back to the ground, engineers have relied on parachutes, or designed the vehicle so that it can land on a runway. But the Starship upper stage takes a different approach. When it is ready to land on Earth, the ship initially re-enters the atmosphere at a 60-degree angle and then ""belly-flops"" to the ground in the horizontal position. This mode of return relies entirely on the atmosphere to slow the vehicle's descent. The downside is that, in this configuration, Starship is inherently unstable. The vehicle therefore uses four steel landing flaps, positioned near the front and rear of the vehicle, to control its descent. This is much like a skydiver uses their arms and legs to control a free-fall. ""It's quite different from anything else… we're doing a controlled fall,"" Elon Musk says. ""You're trying to create drag rather than lift - it's really the opposite of an aircraft."" As Starship approaches the ground, it should be slow enough to execute an engine burn that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. It then uses the Raptors as retro-rockets to guide the vehicle down to a safe touchdown on its landing legs. Musk says this general approach could be used to bring Starship down safely on any planetary surface in the Solar System. Eventually, however, Starships returning to Earth - and perhaps other destinations - might not have to do the flip manoeuvre. The ships could instead be captured as they approach the ground by the launch tower's steel arms - just like the Super Heavy booster. Musk explained on Twitter: ""Ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for Moon and Mars until there is local infrastructure."" In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the upper stage at its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The company started off in 2019 with a 39m-tall ""test article"" called Starhopper - which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower - and flew it to 150m above ground. The first prototype to feature a nosecone and flaps - Starship serial number (SN8) - flew to an altitude of 12.5km in December 2020. It belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of the vehicle's return from space. However, SN8 approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode. Three more test articles exploded before Starship SN15 achieved success with a soft landing in May 2021. In February, SpaceX engineersconducted a key test on the rocket system, what's called a ""static fire"", simultaneously igniting 31 out of 33 of the engines at the base of the vehicle's lower-segment. The firing lasted only a few seconds, with everything clamped in place to prevent any movement. Mr Musk tweeted that the team had turned off one engine before the test and that another engine stopped itself, leaving 31 engines firing overall. But, he added, it was ""still enough engines to reach orbit"" The FAA granted a license that would allow SpaceX to perform a test flight for the rocket, which is scheduled for 17 April. ""After a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,"" the FAA said in a statement on Friday, adding that the license was valid for five years.

Mysterious dark matter mapped in finest detail yet," It's being described as the most detailed ever map of the influence of dark matter through cosmic history. A telescope in Chile has traced the distribution of this mysterious stuff on a quarter of the sky and across almost 14 billion years of time. The result is once again a spectacular confirmation of Einstein's ideas. Although dark matter makes up about 85% of all mass in the Universe, it's extremely difficult to detect and defies a ready description. But dark matter influences the large scale structure of everything we see - where all the galaxies are, where the voids in space are. It's the scaffolding on which the visible structure of the Universe is hung. It neither emits nor absorbs light. The only way you can very obviously infer its presence is through its interplay with gravity. Big rotating galaxies of stars would fly apart were it not for the inclusion of some unseen mass pulling on them and keeping them intact. But dark matter will bend, or lens, background light, and this is how its whereabouts was mapped by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The Chile facility observed the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB - a pervasive but faint glow of long-wavelength radiation that comes to us from the very edge of the observable Universe. ACT mapped the subtle distortions in this ancient light that were introduced as it passed by all intervening matter. You can liken it to the way light is bent as it passes through the bulges and bumps in an old glass window pane. If you know what you're looking at outside, you can use the distortions to say something about the glass. In the same way, the CMB can be decoded to reveal all intervening structure on its journey to us. There have been ""gravitational lensing"" detections similar to this in the past, most notably by the European Space Agency's Planck observatory a decade ago. But ACT surpasses all in terms of resolution and sensitivity. Successive experiments indicate the cosmic contents include: The Universe is calculated to be 13.8 billion years old In the image at the top of this page, the coloured areas are the portions of the sky studied by the telescope. Orange regions show where there is more mass, or matter, along the line of sight; purple where there is less. Typical features are hundreds of millions of light-years across. The grey/white areas show where contaminating light from dust in our Milky Way galaxy has obscured a deeper view. The distribution of matter agrees very well with scientific predictions. ACT observations indicate that the ""lumpiness"" of the Universe and the rate at which it has been expanding after 14 billion years of evolution are just what you'd expect from the standard model of cosmology, which has Einstein's theory of gravity (general relativity) at its foundation. Recent measurements that used an alternative background light, one emitted from stars in galaxies rather than the CMB, had suggested the Universe lacked sufficient lumpiness. ""It's one of the 'cosmic tensions' we all talk about,"" said Prof Jo Dunkley from Princeton University, US. ""But with this new result, we find exactly the right amount of lumpiness - no tension! So, if there is a tension, it is something that appears in the galaxy data - not in ours,"" she told BBC News. Another tension concerns the rate at which the Universe is expanding - a number called the Hubble constant. When Planck looked at temperature fluctuations across the CMB, it determined the rate to be about 67 kilometres per second per megaparsec (A megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years). Or put another way - the expansion increases by 67km per second for every 3.26 million light-years we look further out into space. A tension arises because measurements of the expansion in the nearby Universe, made using the recession from us of variable stars, clocks in at about 73km/s per megaparsec. It's a difference that can't easily be explained. ACT, employing its lensing technique to nail down the expansion rate, outputs a number similar to Planck's. ""It's very close - about  68km/s per megaparsec,"" said Dr Mathew Madhavacheril from the the University of Pennsylvania. ACT team-member Prof Blake Sherwin from Cambridge University, UK, added: ""We and Planck and several other probes are coming in on the lower side. Obviously, you could have a scenario where both the measurements are right and there's some new physics that explains the discrepancy. But we're using independent techniques, and I think we're now starting to close the loophole where we could all be riding this new physics and one of the measurements has to be wrong."" Papers describing the new results have been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal and posted on the ACT website. The telescope, which worked from 2007 to 2022 before being dismantled, was funded by the US National Science Foundation. The scientific collaboration has yet to finish analysing all its data.

Nasa names first woman and black man on Moon mission," The US space agency Nasa has named the four astronauts who will take humanity back to the Moon, after a 50-year gap. Christina Koch will become the first woman astronaut ever assigned to a lunar mission, while Victor Glover will be the first black astronaut on one. They will join Reid Wiseman and Jeremy Hansen to fly a capsule around the Moon late next year or early in 2025. The astronauts won't land on the Moon, but their mission will pave the way for a touchdown by a subsequent crew. The three US citizens and one Canadian were presented to the public in a ceremony in Houston, Texas. They will now begin a period of intense training to get themselves ready. In selecting a woman and a person of colour, Nasa is keeping its promise to bring greater diversity to its exploration efforts. All the previous crewed missions to the Moon were made by white men. Reid Wiseman (47): A US Navy pilot who served for a time as the head of Nasa's astronaut office. He's flown one previous space mission, to the International Space station in 2015. Victor Glover (46): A US Navy test pilot. He joined Nasa in 2013 and made his first spaceflight in 2020. He was the first African American to stay on the space station for an extended period of six months. Christina Koch (44): An electrical engineer. She holds the record for longest continuous time in space by a woman, of 328 days. With Nasa astronaut Jessica Meir she participated in the first all-female spacewalk in October 2019. Jeremy Hansen (47): Before joining the Canadian Space Agency, he was a fighter pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force. He has yet to fly in space. ""The Artemis-2 crew represents thousands of people working tirelessly to bring us to the stars. This is their crew, this is our crew, this is humanity's crew,"" said Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson. ""Nasa astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Hammock Koch, and CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen, each has their own story, but, together, they represent our creed: E pluribus unum - out of many, one. Together, we are ushering in a new era of exploration for a new generation of star sailors and dreamers - the Artemis Generation."" Wiseman will be the commander; Glover will be his pilot; Koch and Hansen will act as the supporting ""mission specialists"". The quartet are essentially repeating the 1968 mission carried out by Apollo 8, which was the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon. Its crew took the famous ""Earthrise"" picture that showed our home planet emerging from behind the lunar horizon. The major difference this time will be the use of the 21st Century technology that Nasa has developed under its Artemis programme. In Greek mythology, Artemis was the twin sister of Apollo. Last year, the agency tested its next-generation Moon rocket, called the Space Launch System, and its associated crew capsule, known as Orion. This Artemis-1 mission left Earth on a 25-day excursion around the Moon without anyone on board. This allowed engineers to assess the readiness of the hardware. Now, the newly named astronauts will climb into Orion for Artemis-2 and a journey to and from the Moon that's likely to take about 10 days. The last human spaceflight mission to the Moon was Apollo 17 in December 1972. The first landing was Apollo 11 in 1969. Artemis-3, the first landing of the new era, is not expected to occur until at least 12 months after Artemis-2. Nasa doesn't yet have a system capable of taking astronauts down to the lunar surface. This is being developed by entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company. It will be a variant of his Starship vehicle, which is due to start flight testing in the next few weeks. ""We need to celebrate this moment in human history because Artemis-2 is more than a mission to the Moon and back; it's more than a mission that has to happen before we send people to the surface of the Moon. It is the next step on the journey that gets humanity to Mars,"" Victor Glover told the Houston ceremony. Christina Koch added: ""Are you excited? I asked that because the one thing I'm most excited about is that we are going to carry your excitement, your aspirations, your dreams with us, on this mission, Artemis-2 - your mission."" Vanessa Wyche is the director of Nasa's Johnson Space Flight Center, the home of mission control. She said: ""Among the [Artemis-2] crew are the first woman, first person of colour, and first Canadian on a lunar mission, and all four astronauts will represent the best of humanity as they explore for the benefit of all.""

Hero's return for astronaut Shaun the Sheep," It was a giant leap for lamb-kind, but now he's baa-ck. Shaun the Sheep has returned to Britain after taking part in the US space agency's (Nasa) epic mission to the Moon last year. A model of the animated movie character was a passenger in the capsule that was blasted into orbit by the world's most powerful operational rocket. Shaun covered almost 1.5 million miles on his lunar travels before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The 16cm-tall stop-motion model was strapped in for the ride. He earned his astronaut wings as the mascot on the mission for the European Space Agency (Esa). The agency had provided the propulsion module that pushed the Nasa capsule along on its 25-day journey. Wednesday saw Dr David Parker, the agency's director of exploration, visit Aardman studios in Bristol, where all of Shaun's TV programmes and films are produced. ""It is always a special pleasure to greet European astronauts when they return from space, and today I am delighted to welcome Shaun the Sheep, alive and wool after a well-deserved rest on the farm,"" he said, tongue firmly in cheek. ""As the first sheep to fly to the Moon and back, he's got a lot to teach us about the ambition, talent and diversity needed for Europe's exploration of space."" Dr Parker unveiled Shaun's official Esa astronaut photo, and presented Aardman with a certificate from Nasa. Accompanying the Esa executive was the UK's newest human astronaut candidate, Dr Rosemary Coogan. The astrophysicist was selected in November to join the agency's astronaut corps and will begin formal training next month. Europeans will fly with their American colleagues on follow-up missions to the Moon later this decade. Dr Coogan could therefore emulate Britain's most famous sheep. ""I think Shaun going to space has been an incredible way to engage the public,"" she told BBC News. ""It's an absolute thrill to think about following in Shaun's footsteps, going around the Moon and getting involved with all of Nasa's missions. It would be an absolute pleasure to do that, and we'll see what the future holds."" Shaun has become one of Aardman's most popular characters. His TV series is currently broadcast in 170 territories around the world and his Facebook page has over 5.5 million followers. Hannah Brooks is one of his animators. In classic stop-motion style, she moves Shaun's silicone body parts, little by little, taking a photo at every step to build up the action. It's a slow process. A day's work in the studio will produce only a few seconds of storyline. ""He's such a cute, cheeky little character,"" said Hannah. ""I can only imagine he would love to have such a big adventure. It's always what he's trying to do in all of his little episodes. He's a bit too naughty, but he has the need to go explore."" Shaun's habit of getting into various scrapes on his home farm, Mossy Bottom, probably convinced Nasa he had to be strapped in at all times. Only the American agency's mascot - a toy Snoopy the Dog - was allowed to float free around the cabin. Esa's tie up with Aardman began with publicity around the studio's release of a Shaun the Sheep sci-fi movie, Farmageddon, in 2019. Aardman co-founder Peter Lord was shocked when the agency suggested Shaun go on a real space mission. ""I virtually couldn't believe it. It seemed incredible,"" he told BBC News. ""It's every child's dream, isn't it, to be an astronaut? And so the fact that he was doing it for us seemed very, very important. Extraordinary. Our baby, our creation."" Nasa's project to return people to the Moon is called Artemis (or as Shaun likes to call it: ""Baa-rtemis""). The next mission is scheduled to occur at the end of next year. Four human astronauts will fly around the Moon. Aardman hopes its little sheep will once again be in the capsule.

Virgin Orbit boss blasts leaders in parting email," A senior executive at Virgin Orbit has hit out at the leadership in a farewell email, telling staff at the bankrupt rocket firm they ""deserved better"". Chief operating officer Tony Gingiss issued a lengthy apology to workers while blasting his fellow managers for apparently failing to say sorry. Virgin Orbit filed for bankruptcy after failing to raise more funding. Earlier this year, it failed to complete its first-ever satellite launch from UK soil. In his goodbye email, Mr Gingiss thanked workers for ""everything you gave to me personally"", adding ""you deserved better than this!"". He continued: ""You simply did not have the leadership or opportunity to demonstrate to the world what you can fully do and how this product could be an enduring force in the market."" He appeared to directly criticise Virgin Orbit's chief executive Dan Hart by later stating he wanted to ""say something to you, that you have not heard from the person who should be saying it, so I will…I'm sorry and I apologize"". ""I'm sorry that I was not able to convince our leader and board to take a different path to give us more time to figure things out,"" he said in the email, which was published in full by US network CNBC. Virgin Orbit has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The company, based in California, was founded in 2017 and is a spin-off from Sir Richard Branson's space tourism company Virgin Galactic. It launches rockets from beneath modified Boeing 747 planes to send satellites into space. But in January, an attempt to send a satellite into orbit from Spaceport Cornwall for the first time failed because a rocket fuel filter had become dislodged, causing one of the engines to overheat. Since then financial troubles at the firm have emerged and attempts to get new investment have also ended in failure. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, the business, which is mostly owned by Virgin Group, announced last week that it would cut 85% of its 750-strong workforce. On Tuesday, Virgin Orbit's boss Mr Hart said that although the company had ""taken great efforts"" to address its finances and secure more funding, ""we ultimately must do what is best for the business."" He said that Virgin Orbit would now concentrate on finding a buyer for the business ""to provide clarity on the future of the company to its customers, vendors, and employees"". The company had debts of $153.5m (£123m) as of September last year. On Tuesday, the company said Virgin Investments, part of Virgin Group, would provide $31.6m in new money to help Virgin Orbit through the process of finding a buyer. It has filed for what is known as Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. This allows a business to keep operating and address its financial issues while providing protection against creditors who are owed money. Former president of Virgin Galactic Will Whitehorn said the failed launch in Cornwall and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US at the time it was trying to raise new funding contributed to its downfall. But Mr Whitehorn said the business deserved a second chance because there was ""a lot of demand"" in the industry. Sir Richard is one of a very small group of billionaires who have in recent years expanded their business empires into launching satellites and attempts to pioneer commercial space travel. The others include Jeff Bezos, founder of online retailer Amazon, who set up his space company Blue Origin, as well as Twitter and Tesla owner Elon Musk, who founded SpaceX.

Facebook $725m settlement fund opens to US claims," US Facebook users can now apply for their share of a $725m (£583m) privacy-case settlement. The legal action alleged the social-media company shared 87 million users' data without their consent, via third parties such as Cambridge Analytica. The allegation, dating back to 2018, remains one of the highest-profile data-privacy scandals. Meta, which owns Facebook, has denied any wrongdoing but agreed to the settlement. Anyone who used Facebook in the US between 24 May 2007 to 22 December 2022 can claim - ""in the range of 250-280 million"" people, according to the ruling document. Claims can be filed on the settlement website or by mail, including: Claimants can choose to receive their funds via: The deadline to claim is 25 August - but anyone wanting to object to the settlement or retain their right to take separate legal action against Meta by opting out must do so by 26 July. Claimants who qualify will be awarded one point for each month they had a Facebook account during the ""class period"". The net settlement amount ($725m minus legal and administrative costs) will then be divided by the total number of points, to determine how much money will be paid for each. A federal judge gave the agreement preliminary approval at the end of March - but a final approval hearing is set for 7 September and there may be appeals that delay the process further. Technology author James Ball told BBC News that Meta executives would be relatively pleased with this settlement. ""On one level, $725m is a huge amount of cash - but Meta is such a large company that this figure represents less than three days of its revenue,"" he said. ""Meta is keen to present privacy issues such as those raised by the Cambridge Analytica controversy as historical - obviously it remains to be seen whether that's the case - as if there are more settlements in the future, that could start to have a more serious impact on the company.""

Facebook still being used to arrange fake reviews - Which?," Facebook is still being used by people arranging fake five-star reviews for products, consumer group Which? has said. It found 14 groups centred around trading reviews for cash or free products - including earbuds, fitness watches and a solar-powered sprinkler. Which? first reported on such groups in 2018 - and the government is preparing legislation to tackle the problem. Facebook said it was investing in new technologies to weed out fake reviews. ""Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews,"" said an official from Meta, which owns Facebook. ""We've removed the groups shared with us, for violating our policies."" The Competition and Markets Authority investigated Amazon and Google over concerns fake five-star reviews could be misleading shoppers in 2021. Then, in April 2022, the government proposed new rules, including making it ""clearly illegal"" to pay someone to write or host fake reviews. It says the average UK household spends about £900 each year after being influenced by online reviews. The new rules are expected to form part of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill, due to be published in the coming weeks. Which? said researchers had found 14 Facebook groups offering cash or products in exchange for reviews on Amazon, Google or Trustpilot. In total, there were more than 62,000 members across the groups. When a researcher had contacted a member of one of the most popular groups and told them they liked some of the products shared there, Which? said, they had been told to buy one of the products and they would be refunded if they gave it a five-star review. ""Despite previous interventions by the regulator, our latest findings suggest an industry dedicated to fake-review trading continues to thrive on Facebook,"" Which? policy and advocacy director Rocio Concha said. ""[It leaves] consumers exposed to misleading information on some of the world's biggest review and shopping platforms."" Amazon has long combated fake reviews on its platform and, in July, took legal action against the administrators of more than 10,000 Facebook groups. An Amazon official said ""in the last few weeks"" it had launched further legal action against more than 20 websites dealing in fake reviews. ""By taking this action against fraudsters, we are going after the source of the problem and shutting down these fake-review businesses,"" they said.

Elon Musk threatens to sue Microsoft over Twitter data," Twitter boss Elon Musk has threatened to sue Microsoft as he accused the technology giant of using data from his social media company without permission. ""They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time,"" the multi-billionaire said in a tweet. Mr Musk was responding to Microsoft's plan to remove Twitter from its corporate advertising platform. He did not provide further details or evidence to support the claim. Microsoft declined to comment when approached by the BBC on Thursday. Earlier, the company said in a notice that its advertising platform would ""no longer support Twitter"" from Tuesday 25 April. As a result, ad buyers would not be able to access their Twitter accounts through Microsoft's social management tool. ""Other social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn will continue to be available,"" Microsoft said. Twitter's press email responded to a query with a customary poo emoji. In a separate tweet, in the discussion about the social media platform's data, Mr Musk said he was ""open to ideas"". ""But ripping off the Twitter database, demonetizing it (removing ads) and then selling our data to others isn't a winning solution,"" he added. In February, Twitter started charging for the data it collects from ""hundreds of millions"" of users, with a basic plan starting at $100 a month. The data allows users to ""manage and track every aspect of your social media presence"", according to the platform. Since buying Twitter for $44bn (£35.4bn) in October, Mr Musk has cut its workforce by around 80% and moved to boost the company's finances through measures including charging users for ""blue tick"" verification. In recent months, major companies including iPhone maker Apple reportedly halted advertising on the platform over concerns about how content was moderated on the site. In November, Mr Musk said Twitter had seen a ""massive"" drop in revenue and blamed activists for pressuring advertisers. Speaking to the BBC last week, he said Twitter had just months left to live when he took over. He also said ""almost all advertisers have come back or said they are going to come back"" to Twitter. Mr Musk added that Twitter could be profitable by the second quarter of 2023, and he would be willing to sell the company if the right person came along.

Facebook owner Meta sees latest layoffs begin," Facebook owner Meta has started notifying staff who are losing jobs in the wave of 10,000 job cuts the social media company announced last month. Boss Mark Zuckerberg had said the layoffs are key to to making the company more efficient. Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has been under pressure since a sharp slowdown in its ads business last year. It had already let go 13% of its staff - roughly 11,000 people - last year. Some of the people affected by Meta's latest decisions wrote on social media saying they were looking for new roles. The company declined to comment, pointing to the March memo in which Mr Zuckerberg outlined the plans, describing last year's challenges as a a ""humbling wake-up call"". He said the cuts were necessary to adjust to a new ""economic reality"" and enable the firm to invest in the future. In March, people on the recruitment team were first to leave the company. The newest notifications apply to people working on the firm's IT teams, according to the firm's plans. Another round of layoffs affecting business and administration teams is expected next month. The firm has said timing could differ for people outside of the US and some cuts may not be complete until the end of the year. According to reports, London-based Instagram employees will either be cut or relocated. The London office became a center for growth for the social-media app when its leader, Adam Mosseri, moved there temporarily last year. Mosseri plans to relocate to the US, along with the staffers The moves come as the corporate world is bracing for a wider economic slowdown, as higher borrowing costs start to slow business activity. The tech industry, where low borrowing costs had helped fuel investments and growth, has been hit particularly hard. More than 170,000 people in the industry have been laid off globally since the start of the year, according to announcements tracked by website layoffs.fyi, with big names such as Amazon and Google accounting for some of the largest actions. Among the other announcements this week, online property firm Opendoor said it would reduce its workforce by roughly 560 jobs or 22%.

US imposes $300m penalty over hard disk drive exports to Huawei," US authorities have imposed a $300m (£241m) penalty on tech firm Seagate for allegedly violating export controls of hard disk drives to China's Huawei. Seagate Technology shipped more than $1.1bn worth of goods to Huawei after export controls were introduced in 2020, the Department of Commerce said. The penalty is the latest move by the US government to stop sales of sophisticated technology to China. US authorities have said such equipment may be used by China's military. Seagate shipped 7.4 million drives to Huawei for about a year after the rule was imposed by the administration of former President Donald Trump, according to the Commerce Department. It continued to do so ""even after Huawei was placed on the Entity List for conduct inimical to our national security,"" Matthew Axelrod of the department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said. ""This settlement is a clarion call about the need for companies to comply rigorously with BIS export rules, as our enforcement team works to ensure both our national security and a level playing field,"" Mr Axelrod added. Huawei's other two main hard drive suppliers had stopped exports to the Chinese firm in accordance with the new rule, the department said. The penalty will be paid in instalments of $15m every three months for the next five years, Seagate said. It comes as the US continues its drive to curb sales of technology, such as advanced computer chips, to China. Huawei was put on a US trade restrictions list in 2019 as part of Washington's efforts to cut sales of American goods to the company over national security and foreign policy concerns. Washington has said the technology could be used by the Chinese military to support human rights abuses or threaten US national security in other ways. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied the allegations. In recent years, many Western countries have taken measures against Chinese technology firms over security fears. Companies specialising in 5G technology such as Huawei, ZTE and Hytera have been banned from installing equipment on networks in the US, Australia, Japan, India, and Canada. Meanwhile, the UK government has ordered equipment installed by Huawei to be removed from 5G networks by 2027. Earlier this week, Chinese surveillance technology giant Hikvision denied that it was illegally disguising its products sold to the US government to enable Chinese espionage. It was responding to BBC queries about allegations revealed in a recently leaked Pentagon document. ",404,business,2023-04-20T03:56:46.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65332208
Twitch: Kai Cenat banned from streaming platform," The Amazon-owned video-streaming platform Twitch has banned one of its most popular livestreamers. Kai Cenat holds the record for having the most subscriptions to his channel, with more than 300,000 at its peak. Now, a message that appears when visiting his channel says it is ""temporarily unavailable due to a violation of Twitch's... terms of service"" and he has tweeted: ""Banned."" Twitch streamers typically play video games while chatting to viewers. Cenat became one of the biggest names in streaming when he broke the subscription records previously set by Ludwig and Ninja, in March. Twitch users can follow their favourite streamers and creators for free or support them by subscribing or gifting subscriptions to other viewers. The basic subscription package costs £3.99 a month - $4.99 in the US - with additional tiers costing more. Jynxzi, 21, now has the most subscriptions, 75,000 - up from 10,000 in September, and more than a million followers - up from 300,000. Best known for playing online shooter Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Jynxzi was livestreaming when he found out he had taken the number-one spot and celebrated in a tweet where commenters called him ""the new king of Twitch"". Twitch has been approached for comment. ",203,technology,2023-04-18T11:19:17.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65305689
Criminal Records Service still disrupted 4 weeks after hack," The body that manages criminal records in the UK is still facing disruption nearly a month after a cyber-attack. The Acro Criminal Records Office provides records to police, exchanges them internationally and processes certificates for people wishing to work with children or gain emigration visas. It took its website and application portal offline, when the hack was detected, on 21 March. Staff has been increased to deal with email applications but delays persist. ""We are working with the relevant authorities, including the National Cyber Security Centre, to investigate and remediate the incident,"" an official said. There was no ""conclusive evidence"" personal data had been compromised but investigations were ""ongoing"". On Twitter, customers said they were facing long delays, with many resorting to contacting the Acro Twitter account in the hope of securing their certificates. John Gilday, in Scotland, told BBC News he had finally received his, so he could apply for a visa to work in Brazil, after three weeks of waiting - though his friend had received his much faster. Rahim Abdel-illah, in Leicester, however, who asked that his surname be withheld, told BBC News he was still waiting for his certificate, so he could get married in Morocco, and had no idea how long it would take as it was now impossible to check the status of his application. ""It's pretty frustrating and annoying that the police are taking so long to recover from a cyber-attack,"" he said. In January, a ransomware attack led to weeks of disruption and delays to services at Royal Mail. Hackers thought to be based in Russia reportedly demanded nearly $70m (£56m) to return computer services to normal - but Royal Mail refused. A suspected ransomware attack by a separate gang with links to Russian cyber-criminal networks hit another big company, Capita, on 31 March. Capita holds many public-service contracts, including providing: A Capita official told BBC News: ""We continue to work closely with specialist advisers and forensic experts in investigating the incident. We are in constant contact with all relevant regulators and authorities. ""Our investigations have not yet been able to confirm any evidence of customer, supplier or colleague data having been compromised. Once our investigations have concluded, we will if necessary inform any impacted parties. ""We have taken all appropriate steps to ensure the robustness of our systems and are confident in our ability to meet our service-delivery commitments."" Capita says most client services remained in operation but has not issued an update on its website since 3 April. And a criminal gang is advertising private information thought to have been be stolen in the hack. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre describes ransomware as a tier-one national-security threat, with attacks continuing to increase in scale and complexity.

How artificial intelligence is matching drugs to patients," Dr Talia Cohen Solal sits down at a microscope to look closely at human brain cells grown in a petri dish. ""The brain is very subtle, complex and beautiful,"" she says. A neuroscientist, Dr Cohen Solal is the co-founder and chief executive of Israeli health-tech firm Genetika+. Established in 2018, the company says its technology can best match antidepressants to patients, to avoid unwanted side effects, and make sure that the prescribed drug works as well as possible. ""We can characterise the right medication for each patient the first time,"" adds Dr Cohen Solal. Genetika+ does this by combining the latest in stem cell technology - the growing of specific human cells - with artificial intelligence (AI) software. From a patient's blood sample its technicians can generate brain cells. These are then exposed to several antidepressants, and recorded for cellular changes called ""biomarkers"". This information, taken with a patient's medical history and genetic data, is then processed by an AI system to determine the best drug for a doctor to prescribe and the dosage. Although the technology is currently still in the development stage, Tel Aviv-based Genetika+ intends to launch commercially next year. An example of how AI is increasingly being used in the pharmaceutical sector, the company has secured funding from the European Union's European Research Council and European Innovation Council. Genetika+ is also working with pharmaceutical firms to develop new precision drugs. The company hopes its work will be in strong demand in the future. There are more than 280 million people globally who suffer from depression, according to the World Health Organization. And while taking antidepressants certainly won't be the correct treatment for all, it has long been estimated that almost two thirds of initial prescriptions for depression or anxiety may not work properly. ""We are in the right time to be able to marry the latest computer technology and biological technology advances,"" says Dr Cohen Solal. Dr Heba Sailem says that the potential for AI to transform the global pharmaceutical industry, which generated revenues of $1.4 trillion (£1.1tn) in 2021, is huge. A senior lecturer of biomedical AI and data science at King's College London, she says that AI has so far helped with everything ""from identifying a potential target gene for treating a certain disease, and discovering a new drug, to improving patient treatment by predicting the best treatment strategy, discovering biomarkers for personalised patient treatment, or even prevention of the disease through early detection of signs for its occurrence"". New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Yet fellow AI expert Calum Chace says that the take-up of AI across the pharmaceutical sector remains ""a slow process"". ""Pharma companies are huge, and any significant change in the way they do research and development will affect many people in different divisions,"" says Mr Chace, who is the author of a number of books about AI. ""Getting all these people to agree to a dramatically new way of doing things is hard, partly because senior people got to where they are by doing things the old way. ""They are familiar with that, and they trust it. And they may fear becoming less valuable to the firm if what they know how to do suddenly becomes less valued."" However, Dr Sailem emphasises that the pharmaceutical sector shouldn't be tempted to race ahead with AI, and should employ strict measures before relying on its predictions. ""An AI model can learn the right answer for the wrong reasons, and it is the researchers' and developers' responsibility to ensure that various measures are employed to avoid biases, especially when trained on patients' data,"" she says. Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine is using AI to accelerate drug discovery. ""Our AI platform is capable of identifying existing drugs that can be re-purposed, designing new drugs for known disease targets, or finding brand new targets and designing brand new molecules,"" says co-founder and chief executive Alex Zhavoronkov. Its most developed drug, a treatment for a lung condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is now being clinically trialled. Mr Zhavoronkov says it typically takes four years for a new drug to get to that stage, but that thanks to AI, Insilico Medicine achieved it ""in under 18 months, for a fraction of the cost"". He adds that the firm has another 31 drugs in various stages of development. Back in Israel, Dr Cohen Solal says AI can help ""solve the mystery"" of which drugs work.

Adele joins James Corden for last ever Carpool Karaoke," Adele has joined James Corden for the final Carpool Karaoke in his last week as host of the The Late Late Show. The singer appeared to surprise Corden at his house in Los Angeles, waking him up by clashing cymbals over his bed. He then agreed to let her drive him to work at CBS Studios, despite her admission that: ""I'm actually not a brilliant driver.' Along the way, they discussed their friendship at length, and shed tears over his decision to return to the UK. ""It's been a crazy eight years,"" said Corden. ""In one sense it feels like it's gone like that [clicks fingers] and in another I feel like I don't remember what life was like before being here."" Adele added: ""I've never lived in LA without you guys so I'm a bit nervous about it, to be honest with you, and very, very sad."" Corden was a relative unknown to US TV audiences when he took over The Late Late Show in 2015, replacing Scottish-American comedian Craig Ferguson. Carpool Karaoke quickly became the show's breakout hit, and Corden's first team-up with Adele became the biggest viral video of 2016. To date, it has amassed more than 260 million views. During their conversation, Corden revealed the difficulties he had in persuading celebrities to take part in Carpool Karaoke when he first came to the US. They eventually got Mariah Carey to agree - but before she got in the car she told him she would ""do the chat"" but she would not sing. Corden knew he had to convince her to change her mind to make a success of the feature - and he succeeded. Since then, ""there's been some bloody brilliant ones, and some [expletive] ones, too,"" Adele laughed, asking Corden to name a favourite. ""Stevie Wonder changed it a lot,"" he replied, ""because when he did it, other artists were like, 'Well if Stevie Wonder's done it, I'll do it.'"" A failed attempt to prank Adele for The Late Late Show was also revealed in their conversation, as they sang tracks including Rolling In The Deep and Barbra Streisand's Don't Rain On My Parade. And they discussed Adele's I Drink Wine, the first verse of which was inspired by a long heart-to-heart with Corden. Adele revealed the song took root during a six-hour conversation as the two stars travelled home from a holiday together with their families. She recalled how Corden and his family has been ""so integral in looking after me"" and her son, Angelo, after her split from husband Simon Konecki in 2019. But when Corden turned to her for advice, saying he wasn't happy with his life in America, the singer admitted it made her feel ""unsafe"". ""You seemed down. You didn't feel strong,"" she said. A few weeks later she wrote the first verse to I Drink Wine and sent it him. ""It [described] everything I was feeling that day,"" Corden said. ""I was floored by how you'd managed to take everything that I was feeling about myself and life and just put it in a verse. ""It was the greatest privilege from a conversation so honest between two friends. That you could create such a thing, it just blows my mind."" Corden went on to say he would miss his colleagues on The Late, Late Show and, more generally, Los Angeles itself. ""It's been a brilliant adventure but I'm just so certain that it's time for us as a family - with people getting older, people that we miss - it's time to go home."" ""I know,"" replied an emotional Adele. ""I'm just not ready to come back yet otherwise I would come back with you."" Corden is set to present his last episode of The Late Late Show on Thursday, with Harry Styles and Will Ferrell among the guests. Adele's Carpool Karaoke segment will also be broadcast on the show, bookending a series that has also featured Madonna, BTS, Blackpink, Britney Spears, Paul McCartney, Celine Dion, Billie Eilish and Elton John in the passenger seat. However, the idea actually dates back to 2011, when Corden took George Michael for a spin as part of a sketch for Comic Relief. The format was later commissioned as a standalone series for Apple TV. Corden only took part in a handful of episodes, with later instalments pairing celebrities together instead. Highlights included Jason Sudekis and the Muppets; Miley and Billy Cyrus; and Kendall Jenner with Hailey Bieber. During his stint on The Late Late Show, Corden also found time to film roles in Hollywood movies like Ocean's 8, Yesterday and Cats, as well as hosting the Tony and Grammy Awards. He announced his intention to step down last year, saying: ""When I started this journey, it was always going to be just that. It was going to be a journey, an adventure. I never saw it as my final destination, you know? And I never want this show to overstay its welcome in any way."" In a farewell interview with Variety magazine, Corden said that Adele's surprise Carpool Karaoke session had meant the world to him. ""The fact that she came and did that for me. The fact that it was her idea to say, 'Well, why don't I drive him to work?' It's really special,"" he told the publication. ""Because what you're actually watching is two friends who moved to Los Angeles, I think a week apart. And one of them is going home and one of them is staying. ""That's hugely emotional. It just so happens that one of them is the biggest singer in the world."" ",937,entertainment,2023-04-24T17:57:49.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65379194
The unlikely (but welcome) return of Everything But The Girl," Twenty-four years after their last record, Everything But The Girl are back. But even they weren't sure it was a good idea. The band built a dedicated following in the 80s for their sophisticated, delicate jazz-pop. An unexpected detour into trip-hop and drum and bass changed their career in the 90s, with a Todd Terry remix of their single Missing becoming a major international hit. When the band split up in 1999, Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt didn't. A couple since they met at the University of Hull in 1982, they only stepped away from the limelight in order to raise a family. With three kids, including twin girls, the couple took turns at parenting, allowing each other space to pursue solo careers. Watt became a DJ, producer, and owner of the deep house record label Buzzin' Fly, while making three solo albums that recalled the folky sound of his pre-EBTG debut, North Marine Drive. Once the kids reached school age, Thorn went back to the studio, releasing four critically-acclaimed albums of her own, while carving out a second career as a writer, most notably in her frank and funny memoir Bedsit Disco Queen. All along, the children were cheerfully oblivious to their parents' past lives. ""We underplayed our careers when they were growing up,"" says Watt.  ""I think we tried once, when our girls were about six, showing them a video of us on Top of the Pops. We thought they'd be really impressed and they just both burst into tears and wanted it turned off. It was too alien for them."" The idea of working together again only surfaced because of the pandemic. Watt, in particular, was housebound and even isolated from the rest of his family, due to the rare auto-immune disease Churg-Strauss syndrome. ""We had quite a strict lockdown because of Ben's health issues,"" says Thorn. ""So, as we were coming out of it last winter, there was a definite feeling of, 'Are we going to go back to what we were doing before, or is this actually a moment to do something different?'"" Even so, ""there were lots of false starts"", continues Watt, ""with Tracey egging me on to commit and me not being sure."" ""Then, one random night at the kitchen table, I just said, 'Screw it. I've got a few sketches on my phone.'"" Apprehensively, he played a few ""piano improvisations and ambient assemblages"" he'd recorded at home. ""And Tracey just said, 'Well, I like four of those'."" Early demos were recorded under the name TREN - Tracey and Ben - as they tiptoed their way back into a creative relationship. ""There was definitely anxiety about how it was going to work,"" Watt admits. ""The period that we'd been solo was longer than the period we were in Everything But The Girl and I wondered if we might clash. But actually, the opposite happened. As soon as we started working, we fell back into a common language. ""And, actually, being able to share the decision-making was really liberating. We didn't have to come up with everything ourselves. We would share half-written lyrics, fragments of music. It was very freeing."" For months, the music was confined to the four walls of the couple's house. ""I did a lot of work just sitting on the sofa, watching the TV, tinkering around and coming up with ideas."" says Watt. It was only when they hired a recording studio near Bath that they finally confronted reality. ""On the first day, when Tracey put up a proper vocal microphone, and we heard it back on the proper speakers, it suddenly became Everything But The Girl,"" says Watt. ""And I think we had two choices at that point. We either were going to run a mile, or we were going to rise to the occasion."" ""It definitely forced us to up our game, to be a bit more musically ambitious,"" says Thorn. ""If you're going to finish a record, you have to summon up a lot of commitment and confidence and go, 'Right. come on. We're doing this properly'."" The result is Fuse, an album that's simultaneously familiar and fresh, honouring the band's classic sound without simply replicating it. Modern touches of 2-step, sub-bass and auto-tune embellish songs that address distinctly adult concerns: Thwarted ambitions, losing touch with old friends, 21st Century malaise, and a constant, aching desire for human connection. ""Kiss me while the world decays,"" Thorn exclaims at the climax of the single, Nothing Left to Lose. ""We didn't really notice those ideas in the lyrics until after we'd finished,"" says Thorn. ""There are lots of recurring themes of desperately trying to connect with people and then [there are] dreamlike lyrics of being out in a club or in a bar. All this stuff bubbled up from those periods of isolation, where we just weren't allowed to do the things we loved for a long period of time."" On the ghostly, compassionate When You Mess Up, Thorn offers up some well-worn advice: ""In a world of micro-aggression/ Little human transgressions/ Forgive yourself… Have a cigarette/ Don't think you're inappropriate."" Some critics have interpreted the lyric as the musician giving advice to her children - but it's actually a dialogue with herself. ""A couple of years ago when I wrote it, I was coming to that phase of the kids having left home and approaching 60. I was thinking, 'Okay, what's the next bit of my life going to be?' And it reminded me of being young. You know, that difficulty you can have in your late teens, early 20s, when you're trying to work out your identity and what you want from life."" The lyrics presented an opportunity to try something the duo had always wanted to do: Scuff up one of the most affecting and recognisable voices in British pop. ""There's a couple of moments when Tracey' goes into this devilish, horror film version of her voice and it's like the mad voices in her head just talking to her,"" says Watt. ""We've never done anything like that before but the technology now exists to manipulate the human voice in many different ways. Frank Ocean uses it really well, Kendrick Lamar uses it really well.  There's a lot of people who turn their nose up at auto-tune, they think you're somehow not being authentic. But I just think that it's crazy to restrict yourself."" Auto-tune aside, fans will notice that Thorn's voice has deepened and roughened. It's a change that adds even more emotional weight to her lyrics - and one she's happy to explore. ""On the last solo album I made, I was becoming very aware of, 'Wow, I've got a couple of extra notes down here at the bottom',"" she says. ""But that's good! As a musician, you always want something new to work with, a slightly different colour. So, I found the idea of it beginning to subtly change really exciting."" The music mirrors that, says Watt, using unresolved chords and suspended notes to create a murky, unsettled atmosphere. ""Some of the piano voicings are quite dissonant in a classical music sense,"" he says, ""and I encouraged Tracy to land on these slightly broken notes in the melody. It suits our lyrics, which are often full of mixed feelings and ambivalence."" Released on Friday, the album has already won a clutch of four and five-star reviews. The Guardian called it ""a comeback worth waiting for"", while Rolling Stone praised the duo's creative risk-taking: ""The only thing predictable about Fuse is how strong the songs are,"" wrote Rob Sheffield. The album's closing track, Karaoke, addresses Thorn's ambivalence about live performance. As she declared in the opening chapter of her second memoir, Naked At The Albert Hall: ""I don't do nostalgia gigs. And by that, I don't mean I don't perform them, I mean I don't attend them either. I don't believe in them."" So is it safe to say that, aside from an exclusive session on BBC 6 Music, the band won't be touring alongside the new record? ""The idea of playing the old songs every night doesn't appeal to us,"" she confirms. ""Pop audiences want to hear the songs as they're recorded. They're not big on you deconstructing or ripping [things] apart. ""We understand that, but the thought of doing the same thing night after night and then getting on the bus and driving to the next place? It doesn't excite me."" As for the future, the band aren't sure whether Fuse is a one-off, or a new beginning. ""We're deliberately not thinking about that,"" says Thorn. ""We didn't think there was going to be another Everything But The Girl record for quite a long time  - and now that there is, we're just trying to enjoy it.""

Stormzy's #Merky Book festival aims to inspire new generation," Storyteller enthusiasts have gathered in Camden for the first #Merky Books free two-day literature festival, put together by Stormzy. #Merky Books is an imprint launched in 2018 by the rapper and Penguin Random House UK, with an aim to develop and produce diverse storytellers. The event, headlined by Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman, the songwriter Wretch 32 and author John Agard aimed to demystify the creative industries and encourage a new generation of writers. Taylor-Dior Rumble, whose novel The Situationship was the first romantic comedy to be signed by Merky Books, told the BBC the festival ""makes the world of publishing feel a lot more accessible"". ""It's very posh, very white, very upper middle class. And for me personally, it just feels kind of like a world away from what I'm used to and what I've grown up in"". Fiona Lamptey, director of UK features at Netflix, said: ""It's important that we as professionals talk about our roles or functions, and how we are part of the process. It's about sharing knowledge so people can understand the skills they need if they're considering a career in the creative industry."" Speaking about advice for new writers she added: ""It's not about standing out. It's about being true to who you are. I put a lot of emphasis on passion and purpose, so if you've got an idea, it's finding an audience for your project. ""I've worked in environments where I'm the only black woman. But I knew the reason why I was put in that environment. I knew I wanted to create a pathway for other people."" Award-winning author John Agard said #Merky Books ""is vital for young people in their reading space, to hear different voices. And it's a very commendable initiative as it opens opportunities for young writers"". He says that to encourage writers from diverse backgrounds into the writing space ""it's important to instil in them from early years the joy of language, and how words are empowering."" He added: ""What this initiative is doing is extending the repertoire of their voice and extending their ability to engage with the page and from the page, you can lead up to the stage.""

Aitch: Why Down's syndrome awareness is so important," If you're a fan of Aitch, you'll know his sister Gracie. His hit song My G, which features Ed Sheeran, is a dedication to her - and the 13-year-old recently joined him in the video for his latest single Round 2. Gracie has Down's syndrome, and the rapper donated a portion of the My G video budget to the Down's Syndrome Association. Now he's going a step further and has skydived to raise money and awareness. Aitch was meant to do the skydive with his dad Mike, who came up with the idea, in March for Down's Syndrome Awareness week. But when windy conditions postponed the jump, the rapper invited BBC Newsbeat along to the rearranged jump on Saturday. And Aitch and his dad bravely completed their skydive at Old Sarum Airfield in Salisbury, with Gracie and the rest of the rapper's family cheering them on. He even convinced one of his management team, Via, to take the dive, too. ""I'm ten times less nervous than I was the first time it was cancelled,"" he said, speaking before he was about to take off. Afterwards, he said it was ""a million times worth it"" - in fact, he enjoyed it so much he wants to ""shoot a video in the air."" Down's syndrome is when you're born with an extra chromosome - and all people with Down's syndrome have some level of learning disability. Aitch tells Newsbeat he's passionate about using his platform to raise awareness. ""I think it's important just because even when my sister was born, I didn't even know what Down's syndrome was if I'm honest with you,"" he says. ""I feel like people are quite funny about certain things, especially when it comes to having kids and finding out they've got disabilities - or even just people with disabilities not getting the same opportunity as everyone else."" The rapper says he wants to raise awareness ""that it's not out of this world to have a family member or child with Down's syndrome, it doesn't mean that anything's any worse or anything like that"". ""If anything, it's a little bit better,"" he says. His favourite thing about his relationship with Gracie?  ""I tend to have the most genuine conversations with her over anyone else."" Also jumping was 21-year-old Niall Ede, for his younger brother Aidan, who also has Down's syndrome. He says Aitch's platform makes all the difference for awareness. ""It's good to have someone that popular with that much of a following involved in it all, just because it reaches out so much further than anyone else can get to,"" Niall says. After the jump, Gracie also had a chat with Newsbeat, and she said what her brother had done was ""crazy"" but ""amazing."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.

Barry Humphries: The satirist and comedian whose life was dominated by Dame Edna Everage," Barry Humphries was described as one of the greatest raconteurs and stand-up comedians of his age. But his achievements as a writer, painter, actor and scholar were overshadowed by his most monstrous creation, the shrill toned and sequined Dame Edna Everage. From her humble suburban beginnings in the mid 1950s, plain Mrs Everage morphed into a global superstar, spreading her homespun philosophy and piles of gladioli wherever she went. On the journey her creator met with critical disapproval and a battle against alcohol abuse, before becoming what the critic Brian Sewell once described as ""an institution"". John Barry Humphries was born in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell on 17 February 1934. His father was a successful builder and the young Humphries had a comfortable upbringing in a pleasant part of the Australian city. He began inventing fictional characters from an early age, spending hours in his parents' back garden dressing up in various costumes. He also discovered a gift for entertaining people and once wrote that doing so gave him a great sense of release and helped him find new friends. His parents sent him to Melbourne Grammar School, an institution that turned out more than its fair share of notable Australian luminaries, boasting leading politicians, artists, soldiers and sportsmen among its alumni. Humphries excelled at art and English, and largely ignored the rest of the school curriculum, later writing in Who's Who? that he was ""self-educated"" and attended Melbourne Grammar School. He studied law, philosophy and fine arts at Melbourne University and became famous for a series of publicly performed practical jokes influenced by his interest in the Dada movement. Humphries revelled in the public reactions to his brand of street theatre which illustrated his delight in making his audience feel slightly uncomfortable. It was something that would be a major part of his later career. After leaving university, he joined the Melbourne Theatre Company where he wrote and performed songs and sketches. It was in the theatre company's tour bus that, according to his autobiography, Humphries first came up with the idea of a suburban housewife called Mrs Norm Everage, the character making her first stage appearance in a sketch Humphries performed in 1955. It was supposed to be a one-off performance but, after Humphries had moved to the Philip Street Revue Theatre in Sydney in 1957, he decided to give Norm, rechristened Edna, another outing and she became something of a hit. At the time Humphries used Edna, a dull housewife with decidedly politically incorrect views on foreigners, as a satire on his experience of growing up in the conservative suburbs of Melbourne. In 1959, Humphries moved to London where he quickly became part of the new wave of satirical comedy featuring artists such as Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller. He also struck up an unlikely, but long lasting friendship with the Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, with whom he shared a passion for both Victoriana and for Cornwall. It was in Cornwall in 1962 that his career almost came to a premature end when he fell down a 150 ft cliff near Zennor, breaking a number of bones. Humphries created the character, Barry McKenzie, the boorish, sexist, arrogant Australian, who appeared in a comic strip he wrote for the magazine, Private Eye. There was much criticism of this character in his home country of Australia which, for a time, banned the sale of a book of the strips. Humphries would receive similar criticism for his character of the lecherous, hard drinking Sir Les Patterson. He was happy to return the compliment. ""Australia is an outdoor country,"" he once said. ""People only go inside to use the toilet. And that's a recent development."" Edna Everage was not well received by the critics when Humphries first launched her onto the London scene, but he was encouraged by Peter Cook to continue to develop the character. His big theatrical break came when he was offered the part of Mr Sowerberry the undertaker in the 1960 stage production of Lionel Bart's stage musical Oliver, and transferred with the show when it was moved to Broadway in 1963. Four years later, he took the role of Fagin when the show was revived on the London stage. He returned to Australia where he toured a series of satirical one man shows featuring Edna Everage and Les Patterson, and the more gentle, and later deceased, Sandy Stone who Humphries described as ""Melbourne talking in its sleep."" In 1973, he co-wrote and appeared in the film, The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, with Barry Crocker playing the title role and Humphries appearing as Aunt Edna. The film also featured a string of stars including Peter Cook, Spike Milligan, Willie Rushton and Joan Bakewell. In the 1974 sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, Edna is created a dame by the then Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. But his success came at a price. He had begun to drink heavily during his time in London and on one trip back to Australia, he was found slumped on the side of a street. His parents arranged for him to undergo treatment, following which he gave up alcohol altogether. Despite his various film and stage appearances, it was in his one man shows that Humphries achieved his greatest following both in the UK and Australia. After a shaky start, he appeared in a series of stage shows including Housewife, Superstar in 1976 and An Evening's Intercourse with Dame Edna in 1982. Often lasting more than two hours, his performances were masterpieces of original material and improvisation spiced with the barbed insults Edna often aimed at members of her audiences. ""Tiles only halfway up the wall, darling?"" she would say in discussion with a victim about bathroom decor.  ""What went wrong, dear - did you run out of money?"" He also became a regular on UK television with The Barry Humphries Show on the BBC and ITV's The Dame Edna Experience. By this time the dowdy housewife from Moonee Ponds had turned into a global megastar, flitting between her many luxurious residences across the world and pausing only to advise world leaders and throw armfuls of gladioli to her adoring audiences. Apart from musicians or dancers, Humphries was only ever joined by one other person onstage - the silent Madge, played by English actor Emily Perry, who was Dame Edna's long-suffering best friend and bridesmaid. Over time Dame Edna's costumes became more extravagant, with her dresses adorned by Australian icons such as kangaroos, koalas and the Sydney Opera House. It took the Americans decades to get his particular brand of satirical humour, but Humphries finally achieved success in the US in 1999, when Dame Edna: The Royal Tour opened on Broadway, eventually running for 10 months. Away from the stage Humphries was passionate about art and literature. A talented artist, he championed the work of many painters, particularly Charles Conder, whose works featured in a BBC documentary which Humphries presented. He wrote several plays, books, novels, and autobiographies for which he won a number of awards including the J.R. Ackerley prize for biography in 1993. In 2012, he announced he was retiring from live performances and set off on a farewell tour of Australia to huge critical acclaim, one reviewer describing Humphries ""as virile, as vulgar and as magnificent as ever."" The tour moved on to the UK, before taking America by storm. A rare sour note came in 2019 when accusations of transphobia led to a major comedy prized named after him being renamed. In comments he later said had been misinterpreted, he drew criticism for describing being transgender as ""a fashion"" and also claimed to have been speaking in character with a reference to gender-reassignment surgery as ""self-mutilation"". Controversy aside, the lure of the limelight proved too strong, and in 2022, he emerged from self-imposed exile with The Man in the Mask: a series of shows looking back at his long career. Fast approaching 90, his immaculate comic timing was still as sharp as ever. When he whipped out Dame Edna's famous glasses, there was an enormous cheer. For more than 60 years, Barry Humphries held a mirror to Australia and Australians, revealing their virtues and weaknesses through a gallery of adored characters, ""It's a kind of therapy,"" he once said, ""I'd miss it if I couldn't do it"".

Newcastle's Farrell Centre explores if we can grow houses from fungus," A new £4.6m architecture centre is opening with an exhibition showing how we might soon be able to grow buildings from fungus, and other innovative ways to reduce cities' environmental impact. The Farrell Centre, set up and partly funded by architect Sir Terry Farrell, opens in Newcastle on Saturday. Its opening exhibition sees four architecture studios offer visions for making buildings more sustainable. They include a structure grown from mycelium, the root network of fungus. The mycelium has been grown on a knitted canopy made from sawdust and paper waste, creating strong, light, self-repairing and fully compostable walls. That is ""completely at odds with how most buildings are built, which usually involves lots of concrete and steel and glass"", said Farrell Centre director Owen Hopkins. Buildings and construction account for 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to the United Nations. The new centre is part of Newcastle University, whose researchers have grown the ""living room"" exhibit. Mycelium is ""not yet"" at the stage where it can be used in real buildings - but is ""not far off"", Mr Hopkins told BBC News. ""I don't think it will be too long before it becomes a material that is seen as viable in more conventional forms of construction. ""One of the things about it is, it's essentially self-healing. If a crack develops or there needs to be more structural reinforcement, it can be grown in situ. ""So it offers some really fascinating possibilities, but also kind of completely destabilises that notion of architecture as something that is finished and fixed."" Other parts of the More With Less exhibition offer ideas of new ways to use insulation, and solutions to make existing buildings more environmentally friendly by using common and low-cost materials. ""Architecture and planning, while they are admittedly part of the problem in many ways, actually have the potential to be really powerfully part of the solution as well,"" Mr Hopkins said. Another part of the Farrell Centre focuses on how buildings and developments affect life in north-east England, and how they can be improved. Sir Terry, now 84, has played a part in shaping Newcastle - by working on the regeneration of the city's quayside in the 1990s, designing the Centre For Life, and extending the Great North Museum: Hancock. His other landmark designs across the world include the MI6 building in London, and he carried out the Farrell Review of Architecture and the Built Environment for the government in 2014. That review recommended a network of ""urban rooms"" across the UK in which local people can have a say about how their towns and cities look. The Farrell Centre is now ""possibly the largest of these"", Mr Hopkins said. It is calling for residents to submit personal items for a People's Plinth - objects that ""offer a snapshot of Tyneside as it was, as it is, and as it might become"". It also wants to create alternative maps of the region. ""Where, for example, do you walk your dog? Where are the best places to buy ice cream? Where are the best local bakeries?"" Mr Hopkins said. ""Or it could get into more personal things. Where do you feel happiest in Tyneside? Or maybe where did you have your first kiss?"" Such maps would create ""additional layers of meaning and experience that actually, we think, are vital to understanding what the city is, how it works, and ultimately how it could be made better"", he added.

What the leaked Pentagon documents reveal - 8 key takeaways," A cache of classified US documents leaked online sheds new light on American intelligence gathered about other countries. Images of the covert files have appeared on messaging app Discord since early March. Complete with timelines and dozens of military acronyms, the documents, some marked ""top secret"", paint a detailed picture of the war in Ukraine and also offer information on China and allies. Pentagon officials are quoted as saying the documents are real. BBC News and other news organisations have reviewed the documents and these are some of the key findings. The US believed the UN secretary general's stance on a key grain deal was undermining attempts to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine. Antonio Guterres was too willing to accommodate Russian interests, according to files which suggest Washington has been closely monitoring him. Several documents describe private communications involving Mr Guterres and his deputy. One leaked document focuses on the Black Sea grain deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July following fears of a global food crisis. It suggests that Mr Guterres was so keen to preserve the deal that he was willing to give in to Russia's demands - a stance which was ""undermining broader efforts to hold Russia accountable"". While the bulk of the leaked documents concern, in one way or another, the war in Ukraine, there are others that touch on a huge range of unrelated issues. Many of them shed light on some of Washington's global preoccupations. Like the spread and purpose of Chinese technology. Three documents based on intelligence from late February detail discussions among senior Jordanian officials over whether or not to shut the Chinese firm Huawei out of its 5G rollout plans. Jordan's Crown Prince Hussein, in charge of the rollout, is said in the document to be worried about retaliation from China if they keep Huawei out. Nor is this the only place where fears about Chinese technology are revealed Another document marked top secret addresses China's ""developing cyber-attack capabilities."" It says these are designed ""to deny, exploit, and hijack satellite links and networks as part of its strategy to control information, which it considers to be a key warfighting domain."" Newly discovered documents suggest Russian officials are at loggerheads over the reporting of casualties. The main intelligence agency, the FSB, has ""accused"" the country's defence ministry of playing down the human impact of the war, the files show. These findings show the extent to which the US agencies have penetrated the Russian intelligence and military. One document, dated 23 March, refers to the presence of a small number of Western special forces operating inside Ukraine, without specifying their activities or location. The UK has the largest contingent (50), followed by Latvia (17), France (15), the US (14) and the Netherlands (1). Western governments typically refrain from commenting on such sensitive matters, but this detail is likely to be seized upon by Moscow, which has in recent months argued that it is not just confronting Ukraine, but Nato as well. Other documents say when a dozen new Ukrainian brigades - being prepared for an offensive that could begin within weeks - will be ready. They list, in great detail, the tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery pieces that are being provided by Ukraine's Western allies. One map includes a timeline that assesses ground conditions across eastern Ukraine as spring progresses. According to the Washington Post newspaper, one document from early February expresses misgivings about Ukraine's chances of success in its forthcoming counteroffensive, saying that problems with generating and sustaining sufficient forces could result in ""modest territorial gains"". Ukraine's difficulties in maintaining its vital air defences are also analysed, with warnings from late February that Kyiv might run out of critical missiles. Casualty figures are also listed. One slide refers to as many as 223,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded, and as many as 131,000 Ukrainians. Some Ukrainian officials have dismissed the leaks, suggesting they might constitute a Russian disinformation campaign. But there are signs of frustration and anger too. One presidential advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted: ""We need less contemplation on 'leaks' and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war."" The Washington Post obtained access to another document from mid-February, where they found that Egypt had plans to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia in secret. The Post said President Abdul Fatah al-Sisi told officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West"". An official is quoted as saying he would ""order his people to work shift work if necessary because it was the least Egypt could do to repay Russia for unspecified help earlier"". It is unclear what the earlier help refers to. In January, Reuters reported that Russia's share of Egyptian wheat imports had risen in 2022, offering one possible explanation. There is no indication that Egypt - a recipient of US security assistance, worth around $1bn a year - went ahead with the proposed sale to Russia. An unnamed official quoted on Egyptian news channels described the allegation as ""utterly baseless"" and said Cairo did not take sides in the war. The Kremlin called it ""just another canard"" and the White House said there was ""no indication"" Egypt was providing lethal weapons to Russia. A classified document, seen by the BBC, reveals that South Korea was torn about selling weapons for use in Ukraine. The report, based on signals intelligence, details a sensitive conversation between national security advisers. They are torn between US pressure to send ammunition to Ukraine and their policy not to arm countries at war. One of the advisers suggests sending the shells to Poland instead, to avoid appearing to have given in to the US. As part of a resupply deal last year, Seoul insisted that the US could not pass the shells on to Ukraine. Seoul has been reluctant to arm Ukraine, for fear of antagonising Russia. The leak has triggered security concerns in Seoul, with opposition politicians questioning how the US was able to intercept such a high-level conversation. The Post also found that Beijing tested one of its experimental missiles - the DF-27 hypersonic glide vehicle - on 25 February. The missile flew for 12 minutes over a distance of 2,100km (1,300 miles), according to the documents. ",1044,world,2023-04-15T01:02:23.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65238951
Nato's border with Russia doubles as Finland joins," Finland has become the 31st member of the Nato security alliance, doubling the length of member states' borders with Russia. The Finnish foreign minister handed the accession document to the US secretary of state who declared Finland a member. Then in bright sunshine in front of Nato's gleaming new headquarters, Finland's white-and-blue flag joined a circle of 30 other flags. Finland's accession is a setback for Russia's Vladimir Putin. He had repeatedly complained of Nato's expansion before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said by attacking his neighbour, the Russian leader had triggered exactly what he had sought to prevent. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia would be ""watching closely"" what happens in Finland, describing Nato's enlargement as a ""violation of our security and our national interests"". A military band played Finland's national anthem followed by the Nato hymn. Beyond the perimeter fence a small group of protesters waving Ukrainian flags chanted ""Ukraine in Nato"", a reminder of why non-aligned Finland had asked to join along with Sweden in May 2022. Finland shares a 1,340-km (832-mile) eastern frontier with Russia and after the war in Ukraine began Helsinki chose the protection of Nato's Article Five, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all. In effect, it means if Finland were invaded or attacked, all Nato members - including the US - would come to its aid. Russia's invasion prompted a surge in Finnish public opinion towards joining Nato to 80% in favour. ""It is a great day for Finland,"" said Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, proclaiming a new era for his country. Finland would be a reliable ally and its membership would not be a threat to anyone, he said. ""Security and stability are those elements which we feel very strongly; if people can live in secure stable circumstances that's the basic element of happy life."" ""This will make Finland safer and Nato stronger,"" said Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg earlier, describing it as a proud day for him and the alliance. ""President Putin had a declared goal of the invasion of Ukraine to get less Nato along its borders and no more membership in Europe, he's getting exactly the opposite."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was ""tempted to say this is maybe the one thing we can thank Mr Putin for, because he once again here has precipitated something he claims to want to prevent by Russia's aggression"". Finland brings with it a well-equipped and trained, active armed force of about 30,000 with a wartime strength of 280,000. It also provides a challenge for Nato to help keep its long border with Russia secure, but it is already being included in Nato's latest defence plans to keep the alliance secure. Sweden's application has for now become stuck, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accusing Stockholm of embracing Kurdish militants and allowing them to demonstrate on the streets. Hungary is also yet to approve Sweden joining. As he handed over the accession document to Mr Blinken, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he had a very important initial task: ""The task is to give to you for the deposit also our ratification for Swedish membership."" Mr Stoltenberg said the most important thing was that Sweden joined as soon as possible and the Finnish president said he looked forward to welcoming his Nordic neighbour at Nato's next summit in Lithuania in July. Helsinki's journey to accession has lasted less than a year, and Tuesday's ceremony coincides with the 74th anniversary of Nato's founding in 1949. ""Finland's a terrific ally, very capable, shares our values and we expect a seamless transition into its proper seat at the table,"" US ambassador to Nato Julianne Smith told the BBC. The Kremlin said that Russia was being forced to take counter-measures to ensure its own security, tactically and strategically, but pointed out it had never had disagreements with Helsinki in the way that Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"". Meanwhile, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Russia's short-range Iskander-M ballistic missile system had been handed over to Belarus and was capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional weapons. Some Belarusian fighter jets were also capable of carrying nuclear weapons, he said. Jens Stoltenberg said Nato had not yet seen any changes to Russia's nuclear posture that would require any change by the alliance. He added there would be no Nato troops stationed in Finland without the consent of the government in Helsinki. Nato will now have seven members on the Baltic Sea, further isolating Russia's coastal access to St Petersburg and its small exclave of Kaliningrad. Mr Peskov told the BBC that Russia would be watching closely how Nato used Finnish territory ""in terms of basing weapons systems and infrastructure there which will be right up close to our borders, potentially threatening us"". ""Based on that, measures will be taken,"" the Kremlin spokesman said. ",821,world,2023-04-04T14:30:27.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65173043
The Ukrainian refugees making a living somewhere new," When Anastacia Kozmina and Oleksiyy Danko woke to the sound of bombing in February 2022, they immediately decided to leave Ukraine. They joined some eight million Ukrainian refugees faced with finding a safe place to live and work. The couple arrived in the UK where they found people to be ""warm-hearted"" and ""supportive"", but finding jobs was hard. So they started their own business. Ukraine refugees have been scattered all over the world. This is the story of how many Ukrainians are finding ways of earning a living somewhere new. In Ukraine, Anastasia worked as a lawyer; Oleksiyy was a qualified pharmacist. They also dry-cleaned furniture to make extra money. Anastacia said when the bombing began on 24 February 2022, she knew she did not want to live in a warzone. The couple had friends who had moved to England, so they put an appeal on Facebook for a sponsor - and eventually arrived in Southport, Merseyside. ""It was a really hard period for us,"" Anastacia says. ""I stopped doing my make-up, my nails, my hair... I needed six months to refresh, to understand that I am in a safe place."" Anastacia tried to find work as a lawyer but because the UK has a different legal system she couldn't, so the couple decided to use their side-hustle skills and started a business dry-cleaning furniture. They has some leaflets printed, and were surprised to receive calls from people who wanted items cleaning, items that were not actually dirty. ""One time Oleksiyy went to clean a small sofa and this lady gave us some beautiful flowers because she wants to support us. She waned to help us, she was really warm-hearted,"" she says. They are hoping to continue to build the business: ""In England we have another life, we have an opportunity to develop ourselves, to grow,"" she says. Yulia left Ukraine three months after the war began. She found a sponsor in Nottingham and drove for three days with her two daughters and their dog. Yulia asked us not to use her surname because her husband is still in Ukraine. Back home, she ran a successful wedding-dress business and her sponsor suggested she start it up again. ""It's a crazy idea, but I think I can try... my profession is my life,"" she says. A friend of Yulia's husband, who was driving to the UK, brought over her sewing machines, fabrics and mannequins. ""It's not easy because system of business in England is different, it's not like in Ukraine,"" says Yulia. She struggled to make her wedding-dress business off the ground in the UK, so decided to use her skills and passion to find a full-time sewing job. Yulia says, although it's been disappointing not to be able to keep her business going, she is happy with her new life. ""We have a nice place, we have nice work, family... I do what I like to do, so I can say that I am lucky."" She says with a bit more time she will try again to get her business going. Polina was preparing the children in her dance school for a competition when Russia invaded Ukraine. ""War started and everything that you planned, it doesn't make any sense,"" she says. Polina lived beside a tank factory in Lviv and quickly realised it would be a target. The following morning she left for Poland and a month later joined her sister who had been living in Canada for a few years. ""It was really difficult mentally because you are still part of Ukraine and you are here in Canada and it's very different,"" she says. ""You need to do something, you need to make your mind busy to feel better,"" she adds. Polina got a job in recruitment but her passion was for teaching dance. She rented space in a studio and started Polli's Dance, teaching Canadian children and the children of other Ukrainian refugees. ""I feel this energy exchange with kids,"" she says. ""It's something that makes me feel happy."" Volodymyr and Regina Razumovskaya left Ukraine a year ago. They had already been forced out of their home in Donetsk when the region was seized by Russian separatists in 2014 and their business was destroyed. The couple fled to Kyiv where they set up another business selling plants. But when Russia invaded the family were forced to flee again - this time to join friends in Perth, Western Australia. ""Could you imagine just to leave your house? To leave you business? To leave your friends?"" Regina asks. ""Even [after] one year passed I just feel this fear inside, you are not sure what's going to happen."" Regina says the welcome they received in Australia gave them the belief that they could start again. Vlodymyr now works full-time because the business in Ukraine makes just 10% of what it did before the war. Regina told us: ""When you trust that there is a future for you, you buy plants. ""The people in Ukraine now are so exhausted, so tired by the war they are losing their trust.""

Ukraine war: Where are Russia's opposition leaders now?," President Vladimir Putin now rules Russia virtually unchallenged. Many of the critical voices that once spoke out have since been forced into exile, while other opponents have been jailed - or in some cases killed. By the time he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than two decades of stamping out dissent had all but annihilated opposition in Russia. At the very start of President Putin's rule, he brought to heel Russia's powerful oligarchs - immensely rich people with political ambitions. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once head of the Russian oil giant Yukos, was arrested in 2003 and spent 10 years in prison for tax evasion and theft after funding opposition parties. Upon his release, he left Russia. Boris Berezovsky, another oligarch who even helped bring Putin to power - fell out with him later and died in exile in the UK in 2013, reportedly by suicide. All key media in Russia gradually fell under the control of the state or toed the official Kremlin line. By far the most prominent opposition figure in Russia is now Alexei Navalny, who has accused Putin from jail of aiming to smear hundreds of thousands of people in his ""criminal, aggressive"" war. In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent, while on a trip to Siberia. The attack nearly killed him, and he had to be flown to Germany for treatment. His return to Russia in January 2021 briefly galvanised opposition protesters, but he was immediately arrested for fraud and contempt of court. He is now serving nine years in prison, and was the focus of an Oscar-winning documentary. In the 2010s Navalny was actively involved in mass anti-government rallies and the many exposes by Navalny's main political vehicle, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), have attracted millions of views online. In 2021 the foundation was outlawed as extremist and Navalny has repeatedly dismissed allegations of corruption as politically motivated. Many of his associates have come under pressure from security services, and some have fled abroad, including former FBK head Ivan Zhdanov, former top FBK lawyer Lyubov Sobol and most, if not all, of the heads of the extended network of Navalny's offices across Russia. Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov left Russia when a money laundering case was launched against him in 2019. Another key Putin critic behind Russian bars is Ilya Yashin, who has been sharply critical of Russia's war. In a live stream on YouTube in April 2022, he urged an investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces and called President Putin ""the worst butcher in this war"". That live stream led to eight-and-a-half years in jail for violating a law against spreading ""deliberately false information"" about the Russian army. The law was rushed through parliament shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Yashin became involved in politics in 2000 at the age of 17, the year Putin came to power. In 2017, after years of opposition activism, he was elected head of the Krasnoselsky district council in Moscow, where he continued to voice views critical of the Kremlin. In 2019, he spent more than a month behind bars for his active role in protests against the authorities' refusal to register independent and opposition-minded candidates for elections to the Moscow city council. Cambridge-educated journalist and activist Vladimir Kara-Murza has twice been the victim of a mysterious poisoning that left him in a coma, in 2015 and then in 2017. He was arrested in April 2022 following his criticism of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and charged with sharing ""fake news"" about the Russian military, organising the activities of an ""undesirable organisation"" and high treason. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison on 17 April 2023. He has authored numerous articles critical of Putin in prominent Russian and Western media and in 2011 led opposition efforts to secure the adoption of Western sanctions targeting human rights abusers in Russia. These sanctions imposed by many Western countries are known as Magnitsky acts after whistleblowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian jail in 2009 after alleging fraud by officials. Kara-Murza was deputy chairman of Open Russia, a leading pro-democracy group set up by fugitive ex-oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. It was officially designated as ""undesirable"" in Russia and finally closed in 2021. Open Russia's head, Andrei Pivovarov, is serving a four-year jail sentence imposed for his involvement in an ""undesirable organisation"". Kara-Murza may be facing a long prison sentence but at least he is alive, unlike close friend and key Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. Before the Putin era, Nemtsov served as governor of Nizhny Novgorod region, energy minister and then deputy prime minister, and he was also elected to Russia's parliament. Then he became increasingly vocal in his opposition to the Kremlin, and published a number of reports critical of Vladimir Putin and led numerous marches opposing him. On 27 February 2015, Nemtsov was shot four times as he crossed a bridge outside the Kremlin, hours after appealing for support for a march against Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Five men of Chechen origin were convicted of Nemtsov's murder, but there is still no clarity as to who ordered it or why. Seven years after his death, an investigation revealed evidence that in the months running up to the killing, Nemtsov was being followed across Russia by a government agent linked to a secret assassination squad. These leading opposition figures are just a few of the Russians targeted for showing dissent. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, independent media in Russia has seen further restrictions or threats. News channel TV Rain has had to move abroad, joining news site Meduza which had already left Russia. Novaya Gazeta remains in Moscow but has stopped publishing its newspaper. Others like talk radio station Echo of Moscow were closed by authorities. Countless commentators have gone into exile, like veteran journalist Alexander Nevzorov, branded a ""foreign agent"" in Russia and sentenced to eight years in jail in absentia for spreading ""fakes"" against the Russian army. But you do not have to have an audience of millions to be targeted. In March 2023, Dmitry Ivanov, a mathematics student who ran an anti-war Telegram channel, received an eight-and-a-half year prison sentence - also for spreading ""fakes"" about the army. Meanwhile, single parent Alexei Moskalev was given a two year jail term for dissent on social media following an investigation sparked by an anti-war picture sketched by his 13-year-old daughter at school. It took Vladimir Putin more than two decades to ensure no formidable opponents were free to challenge his power. If that was his plan, it's worked.

Ukraine war: Who are Russia's war bloggers and why are they popular?," Vladlen Tatarsky, who died in an explosion in St Petersburg on Sunday, was one of Russia's ""war correspondents"". But who are these bloggers - and why are they popular? The writers are a loose assortment of people supporting the war in Ukraine and reporting about it, often from the front lines. They have extreme anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western views. The correspondents - known as ""voyenkory"" in Russian - usually claim to have specialist military knowledge and access to Russian troops. Some are embedded with them - and some appear to be fighting alongside them. The degree of their affiliation with the government varies. Some are employed by Kremlin-controlled media, but others blog on social media - apparently without any links to any media outlet. A major reason why they are so popular with Russian readers is they often offer more information than official reporting - and also offer a different, more critical perspective without questioning the need for the ""special military operation"". Their emergence - after the initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 - heralded a new chapter of war reporting in Russia. For many, supporting the war does not necessarily mean supporting the authorities in Moscow - or, in particular, the military commanders conducting the invasion (although President Putin usually escapes criticism). For example, the commanders were sharply criticised after a Ukrainian missile attack on a building in the occupied town of Makiivka, in which dozens of Russian soldiers died. War correspondent Semyon Pegov, known as War Gonzo, has more than 1.2m subscribers on Telegram - one of the few major social media platforms not banned in Russia. After Ukraine attacked Makiivka, he accused the defence ministry in Moscow of ""openly trying to dodge the blame"". Another pro-war blogger, Boris Rozhin, who blogs as Colonel Cassad - with 800,000 subscribers on Telegram - accused Russian commanders of ""incompetence and inability to comprehend the consequences of war"". Social media accounts linked to the Wagner private military company have been particularly critical of Russia's top brass. And it's this criticism of the military authorities that makes war correspondents stand out from the all-pervasive Kremlin-controlled propaganda, which routinely embellishes progress of the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Some commentators have argued that Russian military commanders feel threatened by critical war bloggers, and there have been attempts to silence them. And popular war correspondents employed by traditional pro-Kremlin media tend to be much more accepting of the official line. One of the most prominent is Alexander Kots, who works for the Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid. Responding to the killing of Vladlen Tatarsky, Kots pointed the finger of blame squarely at Ukraine - just like Russian officials did. ""Earth must be set on fire under the feet of any functionary from Kyiv,"" he wrote. ""None of the non-humans waging war with Russia must feel safe."" Such reporters play a key role in constructing the Kremlin's narratives in the media. For example, it was Yevgeny Poddubny, the war correspondent on Russia's most popular TV station, state-run Rossiya 1, who broke the official silence on Wagner mercenaries' involvement in Ukraine. Reporting from the ruins of a power station in Donbas in July 2022, he unexpectedly said that the site had been ""liberated"" by Wagner. This marked the start of reporting about Wagner in state-run media, which had previously ignored and even denied the group's existence. Both Kots and Poddubny are subject to Western sanctions for their role in pro-Kremlin propaganda against Ukraine. Many of the popular Russian social media accounts supporting the war with Ukraine are run anonymously and material they post is often extremely graphic. One of the most infamous examples is Grey Zone, a Telegram channel affiliated with Wagner, which posted footage of the apparent murder of a ""traitor"" with a sledgehammer in November 2022. Russian war correspondents often call for the destruction of Ukraine as an independent state. For example, Yuri Kotenok has called for the annihilation of the very Ukrainian identity. ""Even cancer can be cured, but Ukrainianism - never!"" he once said on Telegram. ""It's a type of Satanism that can only be destroyed with one thing - fire! All-consuming fire that will cleanse this filth."" Kotenok has more than 400,000 subscribers on Telegram. ",701,world,2023-04-04T14:59:44.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65179954
The 40-year-old British helicopter flying in Ukraine," A military helicopter donated to Ukraine by the UK government was used in the Falklands conflict more than 40 years ago, the BBC has learned. Despite its age, the Ukrainian military says the aircraft will help in the war against Russia. Flying low in the skies over southern Ukraine, the helicopter swoops and turns, following the contours of the ground. From the cockpit and open side door, the crew scan the horizon, alert for potential threats. We are on board one of two Sea King helicopters Britain has given Ukraine - the first media to gain access to the aircraft since they were delivered in recent months. Inside, the mood is serious and purposeful, the menace of Russian missiles not far away. Despite this, the four-man crew is enjoying showing off the new helicopter. They tell us how important it is for them on the battlefield, where it is used for rescuing casualties, moving troops, and carrying out reconnaissance. But why is Britain giving Ukraine such old helicopters, some of which have been flying for more than four decades? The government in Kyiv asked for modern fighter jets armed with long-range missiles to help in a much-anticipated new offensive against Russian forces.  But the UK has not given any of its Typhoon fighter jets to Ukraine - it does not have enough to spare, and it would take too long to train Ukrainian pilots to use them. There are also broader fears that giving warplanes could escalate the conflict. Instead, the UK chose to give them two helicopters that do not carry any weapons or fly particularly fast, and which are no longer used by the Royal Navy, which pensioned the Sea Kings off several years ago. One of them is so old it even saw service during the Falklands conflict, back in 1982, where it played an historic role. The answer to the choice of aircraft can also be found partly here in Ukraine. The crew are clearly passionate about their new helicopter. Co-pilot, Vasil, says the Sea King was just what Ukraine's Navy needed - a practical, reliable aircraft that can do whatever is asked of it. ""I like this helicopter because it is incredibly good for flying,"" Vasil says. ""It's one of the best for combat operations, whether transporting equipment or carrying out search and rescue. It is easy to fly even in difficult conditions."" The Sea Kings are being used to pick up casualties needing urgent medical help, move special forces into position, and fetch and carry equipment. Vasil says one key task is searching for downed pilots, which can involve flying behind enemy lines. ""Pilots have to eject,"" he says. ""They need to be rescued. For this, we have to reach territory which is possibly not under Ukrainian control."" He also emphasises that the Sea Kings are of a similar age to several other helicopters used by Ukraine's armed forces. As such, he and other pilots are familiar with aircraft of that vintage, making their training easier. ""It is spacious, it has good load capacity and it is economical,"" Vasil adds. Another answer to the question about the aircraft's age can be found, perhaps, at a base in southern England, where a third Sea King, which will be delivered to Ukraine in the coming weeks, is being prepared. We cannot say where the base is for security reasons, but we spoke to two Ukrainian engineers who have been there for seven months, training to repair and maintain the helicopter. One engineer, Ihor, tells me that the Sea Kings are in fact mostly new, with very little of the original helicopter remaining. ""They are old,"" he says, ""but they have gone through modernisation, and we need them very much. I believe this is just the start of our work together."" These Sea Kings have spent much of their lives carrying out search and rescue operations - for civilians as well as service personnel - and have been familiar sights over Britain's coasts. One of the two currently in Ukraine was flown by Ralph Wickes-Sneyd in the Falklands in 1982 - he commanded the squadron of which it was part. The retired naval pilot says the helicopter played an historic role, flying through a storm on 14 June 1982 to take the commander of British land forces - Gen Jeremy Moore - to Port Stanley so he could accept the Argentine surrender. No other aircraft could fly due to the bad weather, he says. ""It was quite an interesting operation,"" Mr Wickes-Sneyd explains. ""The ceasefire hadn't been signed up to this stage, and so the aircraft was flying into Stanley competing not just with the weather, but also some still rather unfriendly Argentines."" The pilot also revealed that the Sea King that he flew - the one now in Ukraine - was also flown in the Falklands by Prince Andrew, then serving as a young naval pilot. ""He would have flown the aircraft from time to time,"" Mr Wickes-Sneyd says. ""It was his first tour. So he did what everybody else did, which was sometimes pretty mundane, sometimes quite exciting."" These Sea Kings may be old, they may be few in number, and they may not be the fixed wing aircraft Kyiv wants to help turn the military balance. But the navy in Ukraine says it is happy to have them - and it wants more. There are other Sea Kings in storage in the UK, and if the government decided to give them to Ukraine, the crew and engineers we spoke to said they would be more than welcome. Pilot Vasil says that getting hold of a Sea King is like replacing your old car with a classic ""foreign car"". ""It is so practical. We would like to receive more helicopters like these,"" he says. Back in England, engineer Ihor concedes new aircraft would perhaps be better, but adds: ""It's better than nothing and it's only the beginning.""

The cost of the Ukraine war for one Russian regiment," Kostroma is not a bad place to go looking for the effects of the Ukraine war on Russia. For this city is home to a celebrated regiment that bears its name and has been in the forefront of all the main battles in the Kremlin's campaign against its neighbours. The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment, often called the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, has been the subject of investigations by BBC's Newsnight since shortly after last February's invasion. These have revealed the price paid by the regiment and its home community. We had confirmed 39 fatalities by April last year, 62 by late July, and now the toll has reached 94. Much of the work compiling this list has involved combing social media accounts on V'Kontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and local media reporting. We can then cross reference this with satellite and Google Street View imagery. One video discovered on V'Kontakte showed soldiers' graves at a cemetery north-east of Kostroma. The graves shown in the videos match the names of the soldiers we have collated. The actual number of 331st's dead is probably much higher. Some of the soldiers are from towns outside Kostroma, which makes tracking down information about them much more difficult. Several soldiers have been reported missing - some of these may count among the dead. When one considers those seriously wounded or taken prisoner, it's reasonable to assume that the Ukraine war has cost the regiment several hundred soldiers. The loss of life has caused much comment in Kostroma, which lies about 300km (186 miles) north-east of Moscow and has a population of around a quarter of a million. One local website noted last spring that the entire Soviet-Afghan war, lasting nine years, had cost the city 56 soldiers. Heavy losses in Ukraine have given the local authorities a difficult task of political management. Sergey Sitnikov, Kostroma's Kremlin-appointed governor, has been in the forefront of attempts to convince people that the city's soldiers are being properly supported. Gov Sitnikov's visits to hospitals, barracks, and indeed to the front, have been covered on local TV. On a visit to the front in December, Gov Sitnikov told viewers that ""we need to help [the] guys so they have decent conditions"". He had brought with him crowd-funded care packages and commercially sold drones. Gov Sitnikov is Vladimir Putin's placeman in his home region, so he's hardly a rebel or fearless teller of uncomfortable truths. But his willingness to visit the front and acknowledge shortcomings, even in a coded way, marks an interesting contrast with his boss. When local TV showed mobilised paratroopers on the 331st's parade ground six months ago, it also carried Gov Sitnikov's rather frank remarks to them: ""I'm wishing you good health, success, completion of all tasks… and that you return home alive."" The call-up of paratroopers, part of Russia's wider mobilisation, underlines the degree to which the Ukraine campaign has exhausted the country's professional army, of which the 331st has been a showpiece. In footage of November's parade, 150 conscripts were shown before their dispatch to the front. The total size of the 331st regiment could be estimated at 1,500-1,700. When it first sent into Ukraine in February 2022, it deployed two battalion groups, giving a total of 1,000-1,200 soldiers. After taking heavy casualties in the failed attempt to reach Kyiv, the regiment was withdrawn and rebuilt in the southern Russian garrison town of Belgorod last summer. Subsequent action has seen the regiment moving around all the major flashpoints - Izyum in the early summer, Kherson later on, and now back to Donbas. By monitoring the dates given in the death announcements on Kostroma social media, it's possible to work out when (and often where) the unit was used to spearhead assaults, and the lulls when it was removed from the line to lick its wounds.  For example, a cluster of deaths in February point to elements of the 331st being engaged in Kreminna. Russia's Long War Mark Urban reports on how the Russian 331st Regiment, and their families, are coping with Vladimir Putin's long war Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) Each time casualty replacements - including the conscripts shown on TV in November - are brought in to replace losses, the original cadre of soldiers gets smaller, and the overall size of the unit diminishes. It may now number no more than 300-400 at the front. The losses, and indeed the return of badly wounded men, have resonated in the home community. A few weeks into the war, one user of V'Kontake exclaimed, ""Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What's happening? When will this end?"" Local media has been featuring commemorations of fallen Kostroma soldiers. In December, a TV station featured the unveiling of a plaque to Eduard Reunov, a paratrooper in the 331st who was killed in Ukraine. The style of this memorial and the language used in the report can be seen as an attempt to channel the Great Patriotic War (as the Russians call their 1941-45 fight against the Nazis), implying that today's soldiers are engaged in an equally important cause. But on social media, we've found more modern manifestations of remembrance, and even people seeking revenge. Soldiers are shown holding shells with messages scribbled on them from Reunov's former classmates, and, supposedly, his family. There's a trend seen in a few Russian garrison towns, for wives and mothers to post pictures of themselves with an absent soldier's uniform. One tearful mother of a dead paratrooper from the 331st remembers the Great Patriotic War, and adds, ""I hope there will be stories written about our guys"". Those questioning the sacrifice tend to get short shrift. ""Ukraine isn't my Motherland, our boys are dying for nothing,"" one person recently wrote on Kostroma's V'Kontakte page. Another swiftly countered, ""That's a stupid opinion. No point in writing that stuff here"". It's evident from coverage of Gov Sitnikov's activities that the authorities are trying to mollify those who are anxious about the killed and wounded. It's not clear how much support the war has from the wider Russian public, but the video we've seen suggests there's a good deal of solidarity among military families in Kostroma. The 331st's decline can also be measured in loss to machinery as well as personnel - particularly airborne infantry combat vehicles, known by the Russian initials BMD - that have been used up in successive battles. Initially, when the 331st was part of an Airborne Forces task force pushing towards Kyiv, we had difficulty identifying its vehicles in video of the fighting. A painted ""V"" was used to identify units from all of the various units in that task force, and an inverted triangle symbol with a ""3"" in the centre was also used by one other regiment apart from the 331st. As the fighting wore on, soldiers in the 331st added a further ad hoc marking to the V on their vehicles' sides - an exclamation mark painted next to the V. They may have done this precisely so their commanders could distinguish their armour from the other regiments'. Consequently we were able to identify individual BMDs from the 331st being loaded up on railcars in March 2022, following their withdrawal from Ukraine. They then reappeared in Donbas during last summer's fighting. Open source analysts have also identified at least 25 destroyed BMDs marked in this way, by combing Ukrainian military social media accounts. As with the dead soldiers, this visible loss does not represent the total, since many other BMDs belonging to the Kostroma regiment have likely been lost outside the view of Ukrainian troops. A report broadcast in February 2023 by the Russian network NTV shows an ""armoured group"" of the 331st in action in Luhansk. But it just tends to confirm the impression we've gleaned from other sources that the regiment survives as small detachments able to spearhead certain missions. From the call signs seen on camera this element consists of just three BMD armoured vehicles. So, the regiment's long war goes on. Of the war's wider effects on the Ukrainian population you will glean little from Russian media, nor is there any frank coverage of war-crime allegations. The 331st were accused of massacring hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers during fighting in 2014. For many Ukrainians, the latest Russian losses may seem like nothing more than the paratroopers getting their just deserts. Meanwhile, in Kostroma's graveyard there is plenty of evidence of the price of failure in Russia's invasion. Buried too is the regiment's reputation as ""the best of the best"", and its dreams of easy victory.

Video shows moment Russian fighter jet hits US drone over Black Sea," The US military has released footage of a Russian jet crashing into one of its drones over the Black Sea. The US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Crimea on Tuesday. Russia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events. It was in the Pentagon's interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events. The BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes, but the released footage lasts for less than a minute. On Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""We remain confident in the facts we've conveyed so far."" He said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public. Mr Austin previously described Russia's actions as dangerous and reckless - and the edited video released appears to back that up. A feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian Su-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches. In the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft. When the picture returns, a blade of the drone's propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS that it was not clear whether the Russian action was deliberate or accidental. But he said this did not matter because the moves were ""completely inappropriate, unsafe and unprofessional"". Surveillance flights would continue over the Black Sea, he said, but there was no need for military escorts, which he said were unnecessary and would put pilots at risk. Russia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud. Moscow appeared to suggest on Tuesday that it had imposed a unilateral no-fly zone over the region as part of its invasion of Ukraine. Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said the drone had ""violated boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation"". But Mr Kirby said the airspace was international and not restricted. In a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was ""unflyable and uncontrollable"", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a ""sharp manoeuvre"", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia's security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said attempts were being made to find and retrieve the remnants of the drone. On Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported. Mr Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, ""their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised"". That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken ""mitigating measures"" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.

Bakhmut: Russian casualties mount but tactics evolve," Ukraine has drawn a line in the dirt, and that line is Bakhmut. It is a city that few say matters strategically, but that tens of thousands have died fighting over. It began more than seven months ago, and is the longest battle of the war so far. Two Ukrainian army brigades defending the city's southern flank gave the BBC access to their positions last week as fierce fighting continued in and around Bakhmut. The men have spent months facing both regular Russian army forces, and prisoners recruited by the Wagner private military group who have swarmed their trenches in droves. Troops say Russian casualties far outweigh theirs, but the enemy is deploying new techniques to try to seize the city and surrounding countryside. Ukraine's forces are outgunned and outnumbered, but on a chalk hillside to the south, there is the anti-tank group from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. 3Storm - as they are known - are unyielding. They've dug trenches deep into the earth. Timber props supporting the roof shudder as Russian artillery lands in the near distance, and field mice scurry along duck boards. An antiquated field telephone sits in a wooden nook; these are conditions their grandfathers would recognise. ""They cannot get to us, we can see for a kilometre in all directions,"" says a bearded 26-year-old soldier who goes by the call sign ""Dwarf"", pointing out Russian positions. ""We can hit the enemy with everything we have,"" he says. Neither the Russian nor Ukrainian armies release official casualty figures for Bakhmut, or elsewhere, but the mostly abandoned city has become a slaughter house. In a week fighting for the city, Dwarf's company faced conscripted prisoners from Russia's Wagner group. ""We had battles every two hours,"" he says. ""I guess a single company eliminated 50 people per day."" In case of any doubt, he points out these numbers were confirmed by aerial reconnaissance. ""The [Russian vehicle] arrives, 50 bodies come out, a day passes, 50 bodies come out again,"" he says. His company lost a fraction of that number, he says. Officially, Ukraine estimates that for every one of its soldiers killed, Russia loses seven. Earlier this week, Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members in a 24-hour period in the battle for Bakhmut. None of these numbers can be independently verified. In a newspaper interview, two captured Wagner conscripts told the Wall Street Journal that before they are sent forward, they receive little training beyond learning to crawl through forests in the dark. After six months serving at the front they are freed - assuming they survive. Conditions all along the 600-mile-long eastern front have begun to change. 3Storm's chalky hilltop hideout feels like dry land compared with the surrounding territory. An early spring has turned the hard ground of winter to mud porridge - which may favour the defenders. To get there, we had to follow the Ukrainian soldiers on foot - within a few paces my boots become lumpen and heavy with thick dirt. A battlefield ambulance speeds by unsteadily, its caterpillar tracks ploughing up the ground, and spraying pools of sludge as it struggles for grip. The villages around here - the location can't be revealed - are in ruin. Handwritten signs on gates, mostly in Russian, announce ""People Live Here"", a plea as much as it is a statement. But the streets are entirely empty, apart from abandoned dogs who roam the ruins of destroyed farms and homes. For the past two months, Russian forces have steadily advanced, trying to encircle Bakhmut. The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, says his forces will continue to resist. ""Every day of steadfast resistance wins us valuable time to reduce the enemy's offensive capabilities,"" he says, sending more reinforcements to the area. But it isn't only Russians who have fallen into the Bakhmut trap. Ukrainians are dying there, too, in ever increasing numbers. On the hillside, a group of soldiers have gathered around a gun position, and I ask Dwarf - given that Ukraine is losing soldiers to untrained Russian convicts - if the defence of dead city, surrounded by the enemy, makes sense. He says, ""I was wondering, myself, if we should keep defending Bakhmut. On the one hand what's happening here now is awful. There are no words to describe it. But the alternative is we give up Bakhmut and move to another settlement. What's the difference between defending Bakhmut or any other village?"" His comrade, a strongly built man with a full dark beard who goes by the call sign Holm, agrees. ""It's not a strategic question for us here. We are ordinary soldiers. But this is our land. We may then retreat to Chasiv Yar, from Chasiv Yar to Slovyansk, and so we retreat up to Kyiv. Let it take a year or two, four, five - but we have to fight for every piece of our land."" The men have been fighting for more than a year now, and they say the Russians are evolving. ""They are learning, they are getting cleverer, and it really freaks me out,"" says Dwarf. ""They send out a group - five morons taken from prison. They are shot, but the enemy sees where you are, walks around, and you are surrounded from behind."" Holm chimes in that Russia is now using drones armed with grenades more effectively. ""We used to drop them and freak them out,"" he says. ""Now they're dropping drone grenades on our positions."" Before the war, Dwarf was an outdoor youth worker and would take youngsters hiking in the Carpathian Mountains on the country's western edge. Here on Ukraine's eastern front, that is a far-off memory. He's been in many battles since then, but the horror of Bakhmut is what lives with him now. When I ask about Wagner's convict army, he pauses to think and says, ""I'll be honest. It's genius. Cruel, immoral, but effective tactics. It worked out. And it's still working in Bakhmut."" Days later, I'm back in the same area, crammed with four others into a Soviet-era UAZ jeep. Its steering wheel has the BMW logo - a joke says the driver, Oleg. He says little else as he grips the wheel and concentrates hard as the car whines and struggles over hills and through the shoals of muck. The automatic gunfire ahead signals we are nearing the 28th Mechanised Brigade, who are directly facing the Russians. The landscape of war shifts in an instant - the men are holed up in a small wood, its trees shattered and split by Russian fire. In a month, the wood will offer them cover. For now, its bare branches expose them to surveillance drones. Nearby there's an exchange of gunfire, and Russian shells strike around 500m away. But Borys, a 48-year-old former architect who is serving now as a captain, seems untroubled. ""Today's war is a drone war,"" he says, ""but we can walk around freely, because there's wind and rain today and drones are blown away. If it was quiet today, both our drones and our enemy's would be hovering over us."" On the way back, Oleg brings the jeep to a sudden halt. Lying in the dirt in front of us is a drone that has been blown off course. Its battery is quickly removed and it is brought inside - it turns out to be Ukrainian. But today's war isn't so very different from the past. Two nights before, the 28th Brigade was attacked by Russian infantry and tanks. In a timbered gun position below ground, the cold rain drips through the roof onto the dirt floor, and there, peering out into the bare landscape, is a Maxim belt-fed machine gun with stout iron wheels. ""It only works when there is a massive attack going on…then it really works,"" says Borys. ""So we use it every week"".

Holiday swindlers: The rise of digital travel scams," Digital travel scams are a growing ""systemic and global"" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations. Last December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe. It was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north. To begin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for. Two further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid. At the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already. Initially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. ""Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'"" Altogether, Maria says she lost $30,000 on the holiday - $15,000 of the money she had paid in advance, plus an extra $15,000 for just one of the hotels. Maria says that as well as telling her he'd paid for the room, Rafael Bessa said he'd got her a free upgrade - but he hadn't, and the hotel charged the staggering full price for the super de luxe room. Rafael Bessa's promises of reimbursement came to nothing, Maria says. Although he sent her various ""proofs"" of money transfers, the cash never actually arrived in her account. Then, when she posted about her experiences on social media, she says his lawyer got in touch, offering to reimburse $20,000 as long as she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She refused. The BBC asked Rafael Bessa to comment on Maria's allegations. He replied that there had been an unspecified ""problem"" with the price of one of the hotels, and that the room at this price had not been included in the package. He also sent copies of the train bookings - which, as Maria said, both bore the same purchase number. Another Brazilian woman, Ana Jalenna, booked an Alpine skiing trip and also an Italian summer holiday with Rafael Bessa, after he had organised a ""fantastic"" family holiday for her in Brazil. She paid part of the bill in cash, and the plan was that he would put the rest on her credit card. Some time later, she was surprised to see a payment to British Airways appear on her card account and called him to ask about it. It was the payment for her Italian hotel, he told her. Finding this hard to believe, she emailed the hotel and was told no payment had been made. Ana decided to ask Rafael Bessa for proof that he had at least made the bookings at the ski resort. He gave her two reservation numbers, but the hotel told her they were invalid. ""I lost the money, the dream, the trip. I lost everything,"" she says. She later spoke to other dissatisfied clients of Rafael Bessa's, and noticed a pattern. ""The first trip was fantastic and everything is OK,"" she says. ""And then he does a longer trip, a better trip with expensive hotels, and he does this to people."" Rafael Bessa insisted to the BBC that he booked the Italian hotel. He said Ana cancelled the skiing trip, and he paid her back the money. But Ana said she didn't cancel it - and wasn't reimbursed. The Holiday Swindler: The rise of digital travel scams Social media is tempting people to sample the luxury holiday lifestyle, but what happens when it all goes wrong? This is the story of one Brazilian travel agent with a trail of unhappy clients around the world. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Maria and Ana were angry and scarred by their experience, but neither suffered financial hardship as a result. For Adriane Trofin, a Brazilian working mother of two who lives in London, the failure of her dream family holiday to Greece this year was more traumatic. She first came across Rafael Bessa on Facebook, captivated by his posts from beautiful locations, and struck up an online friendship. She explained that she couldn't afford that kind of holiday herself, but he replied that there were trips for every budget, and she ended up booking a dream holiday to Greece for 14 people in total - members of her family and a number of friends. They had paid Rafael Bessa in advance for the stay at a four-star Club Med resort, but the cars that should have met them at Athens airport didn't arrive. Adriane messaged Rafael Bessa for help. He reassured her that everything had been booked, and gave her three telephone numbers for the car company, but she couldn't get through on any of them. The group was stranded for hours. Eventually, the airport operations manager for Club Med, David Doepfer, came to their assistance. He quickly established that there was no Club Med booking in Adriane's name. Rafael Bessa had once reserved rooms, he learned, but had not paid for them before the expiry date. David called the travel agent and asked him to book a different hotel in Athens for the group, which he agreed to do. But David says that when he called the new hotel to check Rafael Bessa had stuck to his word he was told the rooms had not been paid for. In the end Adriane's husband paid for the entire group to stay in another hotel, at a cost of $8,500. ""I spent that week, those seven days, discussing with Rafael day and night on the phone, trying to make him send at least a part of the money. He started to mock me,"" Adriane says. He also harassed other members of the group, she says, convincing some of them that the problem was Adriane's fault and that she owed him money. ""I was in hell. I had never faced a worse situation in my life, I never had anything worse in my life than those seven days in Greece. ""My marriage is still badly shaken by that. For me, it's a lot of money, you see? But it's no longer just about the money."" She says the experience left her ""emotionally destroyed"". Despite having assured Adriane, as she waited at the airport, that everything would be fine, Rafael Bessa told the BBC he had cancelled the hotel booking because Adriane had failed to pay everything she owed him. But Adriane showed the BBC evidence of money transfers made before the trip covering the full cost of the hotel. She had agreed with Rafael Bessa to pay for three plane tickets in instalments, and was up to date with these payments - which Mr Bessa confirmed in screengrabs of messages he sent to the BBC. The BBC has spoken to 10 other clients of Rafael Bessa. Together with Maria, Ana and Adriane they say they paid him $90,000 for services that were not provided. We also spoke to Brazilian lawyer Victor Penido Machado, who is bringing a case against Rafael Bessa on behalf of nearly 50 clients. They paid a total of $183,000 for hotel bookings and other services that were not delivered, he says. A similar pattern is repeated again and again, the lawyer says. Clients arrive at their destinations, find a hotel has not been paid for, and are unable to get Rafael Bessa to pay them back. Approached by the BBC, Mr Bessa denied the allegations made by his former clients, saying he was ""shocked"". ""I'm really surprised by the amount of errors, 90% of your facts are false,"" he wrote. The UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) says social media is increasingly being used by travel agents to persuade customers to buy a dream holiday - one that they too can look forward to posting on social media. ""Because they are being displayed on social media, tourists may have the perception that these services are more reliable than if they would find them on any regular website,"" says UNWTO legal counsel, Alicia Gomez. At the same time, digital travel scams are on the rise all over the world, Ms Gomez says. ""This has become a global and systemic problem. Many national consumers and authorities are reporting an increase in online scams, and the number may be even higher as the shame and the guilt of tourists that fall for them discourage reporting."" The UNWTO has developed a code for the protection of tourists, which it says clarifies the responsibilities of social media companies, governments and consumers and describes how governments and private companies can best work together. Seven countries have signed up to the code so far, making it part of their national legislation, while others, including Brazil, are in the process of doing so. Meta, owner of Instagram and Facebook, told the BBC: ""We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers out. ""We continue to invest in new technologies and spent approximately $5bn last year alone on safety and security."" ",1639,world,2022-11-24T00:11:11.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63727404

TikTok profits from livestreams of families begging," Displaced families in Syrian camps are begging for donations on TikTok while the company takes up to 70% of the proceeds, a BBC investigation found. Children are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value. The BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (£900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that. TikTok said it would take prompt action against ""exploitative begging"". The company said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount. Earlier this year, TikTok users saw their feeds fill with livestreams of families in Syrian camps, drawing support from some viewers and concerns about scams from others. In the camps in north-west Syria, the BBC found that the trend was being facilitated by so-called ""TikTok middlemen"", who provided families with the phones and equipment to go live. The middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok's global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app. Since the TikTok algorithm suggests content based on the geographic origin of a user's phone number, the middlemen said they prefer to use British SIM cards. They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters. Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: ""Please like, please share, please gift."" Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind. The gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content. For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account. Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however. With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes. A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account. At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts. TikTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated £300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same. When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was ""ridiculous"" and ""unfair"" to families in Syria. ""You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,"" he said. The $33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19. Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok. He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day. Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said. Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by ""live agencies"" in China, who work directly with TikTok. ""They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,"" Hamid said. Agencies like these, known as ""livestreaming guilds"" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams. TikTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC. The emphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time. Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform. TikTok Begging in Syria BBC News investigates a new trend on TikTok - hundreds of families in camps for displaced people in Syria, begging for gifts on TikTok livestreams. Watch on BBC News Channel Sunday 02:30 or on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) ""TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,"" she said. She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online ""to try to seek support and sympathy"", but she says these livestreams ""lack dignity, and are humiliating"". TikTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform. But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases. After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts. It said in a statement: ""We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action. ""This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging."" TikTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower. The BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live. A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses. But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok.

'Claims I had sexsomnia destroyed my rape case'," Jade McCrossen-Nethercott's rape case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) because of claims she had an episode of a rare sleep condition called ""sexsomnia"". As a result, the CPS no longer believed they could secure a conviction. But Jade challenged the decision and spent months reinvestigating. The CPS now admit they were wrong not to take it to trial and have apologised unreservedly to her. But what went wrong? The BBC followed Jade's case as events unfolded. It was a Sunday evening in the spring of 2017 when Jade woke up on a sofa in south London to discover she was half-naked, with her necklace lying broken on the floor. The 24-year-old, originally from St Ives in Cornwall, had the intense feeling she had been penetrated and thought she had been raped while she slept. Three years later - and just days before the man charged with raping her was due to stand trial - lawyers from the CPS called her to an urgent meeting at a police station. Her case was being dropped. The CPS lawyer explained that two sleep experts had given their opinions on her case. They said it was possible Jade had had an episode of sexsomnia and could have appeared to have been awake and consenting. Sexsomnia is a medically-recognised sleep disorder. People with the condition perform sexual acts in their sleep. A person is deemed not to have consented to sex if they are asleep, according to the law in England and Wales. However, it also states that a person is not guilty of rape if they had ""reasonable belief"" in consent. ""It came completely out of the blue, and it was baffling,"" says Jade, who had never heard of sexsomnia until then. ""I've had two long-term relationships spanning 13 years, and I've never had anything like this."" ​​The decision by the CPS meant they would close the case and the defendant would be formally acquitted. The first time Jade had been asked about her sleep, was in the police station when she went to give a formal statement. In response to a question from a police officer, she explained that she had always been a deep sleeper and had sleepwalked a couple of times as a teenager. It was a passing comment, forgotten about in the whole gruelling process until her case was dropped. It had been Jade's best friend Bel who had dialled 999 and started the whole police process. She remembers the sound of Jade's voice on the other end of the line. ""It was like nothing I've ever heard before. She was hysterical and sobbing, and she said 'I think I've been raped.' When your best friend says that to you, it's just earth-shattering."" The two had been out the evening before at a bar in south London. They had got ready together, drinking prosecco as they did their makeup and headed out arm-in-arm. It was a fun evening, drinking and chatting. When closing time came, Bel ordered a taxi home. Jade decided to go back to a friend's flat with a few people for a last drink. At around 02:00, with people still chatting around her in the living room, she curled up under a blanket in the corner of the sofa, fully-clothed, and fell asleep. At 05:00 she says she woke up to find her trousers and pants were off and her bra was undone. She says she saw a man on the other side of the sofa she was lying on. ""I confronted him saying, 'What's happened? What have you done?' And he said something a bit odd I guess, but he did say 'I thought you were awake.' ""And he just bolted out basically, and left the door open. And I got my phone and started calling Bel…"" Two male police officers arrived and took Jade straight for forensic tests. Vaginal swabs detected semen which would later be matched to the man on the sofa. The suspect offered no comment when initially questioned by police. The CPS made the decision to charge him with rape. He pleaded not guilty. A date was set for trial. But it never went ahead. Jade was determined to prove the CPS were wrong to drop her case, but she had limited time to appeal. She requested all the evidence - including police interviews, toxicology results, witness statements and the sleep experts' reports - and pored over them. She was shocked by what she read - and in particular the weight given to the sleep experts' theories. Sexsomnia: Case Closed? When unexpected sleepwalking claims turn a rape case on its head, Jade fights back. Filmed over three years, this is the remarkable story of one woman's battle for justice. Will she win? Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Neither expert had met her in person, but their opinions had been significant enough to close her case. The first expert, who had been instructed by the defence, concluded there was a ""strong possibility"" that Jade had an attack of sexsomnia, saying ""her behaviour would have been of someone actively engaging in sexual activity with eyes open and showing pleasure"". The CPS then hired their own expert in response. He concluded that ""a history of sleepwalking, even once at the age of 16 years, and ongoing sleep talking or any family history, is entirely adequate to establish a predisposition to sexsomnia"". Jade was speechless. ""I don't see how this can be one isolated incident [of sexsomnia], that just so happens to be the time that somebody I would never have consented to have sex with had sex with me,"" she says. Jade decided to pay for her own expert opinion and approached Dr Irshaad Ebrahim at the London Sleep Centre. He also has experience of giving expert opinions in rape cases. Jade's case was the first he had seen where a complainant victim was purported to have sexsomnia. In all the other rape cases he had encountered, it was the defendant claiming to have had an attack of sexsomnia. The BBC carried out extensive research and could not find any other UK rape case where the defence had argued the complainant had sexsomnia. Dr Ebrahim explained there was limited scientific research and no precise way of diagnosing sexsomnia. But he said people he sees with the disorder are typically male and tend to have a history of the sexual behaviour in their sleep. Jade then underwent a sleep test - a polysomnography, which monitors brainwaves, breathing and movement during sleep. The test indicated that she snores and has mild sleep apnea, a common condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep. Both were, according to Dr Ebrahim, potential trigger factors for sexsomnia, so he could not rule out that she may have had an isolated episode. Jade wanted to know if he could give her a clear idea of what the chances were that sexsomnia had been to blame for what happened. ""That is the billion dollar question,"" said Dr Ebrahim. ""Wanting a definitive, black and white answer - yes it was or no it wasn't - is not going to happen."" Jade still believed she didn't have sexsomnia - but was frustrated the sleep experts couldn't rule it out. She turned to a lawyer to find out more about how courts treat the disorder as a defence. Barrister Allison Summers KC has defended in rape cases where the man accused has claimed to have sexsomnia. She told Jade that sleep experts are almost never able to say definitively whether someone has the condition - but saying ""it's possible"" could be enough for a jury to reach a not guilty verdict. ""Do I think, as a result of that, that some guilty people get off or are acquitted? Yes, I do. But I generally come back to the point that I would rather that be the case, than we're convicting people of serious offences that are genuinely not guilty,"" she said. ""The only thing I can say is that you hope the criminal trial process will enable those genuine cases to be pulled out from those less genuine."" Sexsomnia and other sleepwalking defences should always be robustly challenged in court, according to the CPS guidelines. But Jade's case never made it to court. Armed with her research, she submitted her appeal, known as a victim's right to review. A chief crown prosecutor, independent of the CPS department which made the original decision to close the case, reviewed all the evidence again. He concluded the case should have gone to trial - and that the sleep experts' opinions, and the defendant's account, should have been challenged in court. A jury would have been ""more likely than not"" to convict the defendant, he said - one of the tests a case must meet for the CPS to take it to trial. ""I cannot begin to imagine what you have been through and how you feel. I noted during my review the devastating effect of this case on you,"" he wrote to Jade. ""I apologise unreservedly for this on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service although I appreciate that is likely to be of little consolation to you."" If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, help and advice can be found here For Jade, the acknowledgement that her case should have been put to a jury was bittersweet - because the CPS cannot reopen the case. The defendant was found officially not guilty - and so double jeopardy laws mean he cannot be tried without compelling new evidence. ""There is no hope of any justice for what happened to me,"" says Jade - but she hopes the CPS will learn lessons to prevent others from going through similar ordeals. ""It's just being let down by a system that's there to protect - and they've openly said they messed up,"" she says. In the year to September 2021, just 1.3% of rape cases recorded by police in England and Wales resulted in a suspect being prosecuted, according to Home Office figures. The CPS say they are ""committed to improving every aspect of how life-changing crimes like rape are dealt with and are working closely with the police to transform how they are handled."" Jade is now suing the CPS for damages. ",1724,uk,2022-10-04T23:32:09.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63116989
Charity research finds that only 1% of disability hate crimes end with a charge," Of the thousands of disability hate crimes reported to the police last year, just 1% resulted in criminal charges, two charities have revealed. Leonard Cheshire and United Response submitted Freedom of Information requests to 43 police forces in England and Wales and 36 responded. It found that out of more than 11,000 reports, 99% of cases went no further. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it wanted ""to understand the reasons"" behind the low number. A hate crime is an offence which targets a victim's protected characteristics, including their race, religion, sexual orientation or disability. PhD student, Cassie Lovelock from London, told the BBC Access All podcast she has experienced physical and verbal abuse because of her disability many times. She has hereditary neuropathy with a liability for pressure palsies (HNPP), a rare condition with similar symptoms to MS, and often uses a wheelchair. On one occasion, while waiting for her boyfriend outside a shop, two drunk men grabbed her wheelchair and pushed her down the road while making sexual comments. Despite screaming for help, she claims passers-by ignored her. She eventually escaped by rolling her wheelchair into the road. On the latest episode of Access All, Cassie talks more about her experiences of disability hate crime and the team look at the support available. And a month into Prime Minister Liz Truss's premiership there's still no confirmation about who the new Minister of State for Disabled People will be…or is there? On another occasion, Cassie was pushed out of her wheelchair by a woman who wanted to use the wheelchair space on a London bus for her pushchair. ""It was very humiliating,"" Cassie says. The bus driver witnessed the incident, helped Cassie and refused to let the other woman travel. Cassie says the incidents she has endured - including being shouted at on the street and accused of faking her disability - have all been ""intrinsically tied"" to her disability. But, she admits, she hasn't always reported her experiences immediately because she wasn't sure they would be considered hate crimes. Ali Gunn, policy lead for United Response, which was involved in the research, says Cassie's experience is common. ""A lot of the time victims don't even know they've been a victim of a disability hate crime"" and, as a result, the number of reported incidents could be the ""tip of the iceberg"". She says a disability hate crime is classed as ""any criminal offence that is motivated by a person's disability or perceived disability"". Of those hate crimes that were reported but went no further, Ali says: ""We found that around 50% of the no-charge outcomes were a result of either the victim withdrawing support, evidential difficulties despite there being a named suspect, or that the police were unable to find a suspect."" She says its ""really important for the victim to capture as much information as possible - what they hear, what they see, or what's happening and the date, the time, the location"". But she adds that the whole community should play its part. ""If you witness a crime you might feel uncomfortable or nervous to go up at the time, but afterwards please support the victim. Give your phone number, give any information that you were able to record at that point in time about what happened."" The two charities - Leonard Cheshire and United Response - which conducted the research have called for police forces to appoint Disability Liaison Officers. ""They would be able to support a disabled victim from the point of reporting all the way through,"" Ali says, hopefully resulting in a higher charge rate. This week, the Home Office also released its statistics on hate crimes. It reported that 14,242 disability hate crimes had been recorded in the year ending March 2022 - an increase of 43% on the previous year. That figure has doubled since 2017/2018 with stalking and harassment offences the most commonly recorded disability hate crimes. A Home Office spokesperson described hate crime as a ""scourge on communities"" and said that ""while the rise is likely to be largely driven by improvements in police recording, we cannot be complacent."" They added: ""[We] expect the police to fully investigate these hateful attacks and make sure the cowards who commit them feel the full force of the law."" After thinking about the incident with the men, Cassie did report it to the police. She received a call from an officer and a case number, but says she never heard from them again, putting Cassie's case in the 99% that result in no charge. The force was unable to corroborate this information. Cassie is getting on with her PhD, but says the ""terrifying"" experiences have stayed with her and she has changed where she shops and which public transport she uses as a result. ""Even now, I get this anxiety - what if something happens?"" she says. You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the Access All page.

"Black, Korean and searching for the American dream"," An outcast from birth, Milton Washington is the child of a Korean woman and a black US soldier, who became a ""slickyboy"", or child thief, and dreamed of making it to America. At the age of eight, he seized his chance. When a beautiful car pulled up one day outside St Vincent's orphanage in South Korea, Milton Washington made a split-second decision that would change the course of his life. A black American couple stepped out. The man was in military uniform, the woman had an Afro and wore a beautiful flowing dress, and when Milton realised that they were going to adopt his friend Joseph - who was black and Korean just like him - he ran to the couple's car, jumped inside and locked all the doors. Crying and screaming for his life, he wasn't getting out unless the man and woman took him home with them too. The couple - Captain and Mrs Washington - agreed to take both Joseph and Milton home, but only to see which of them fitted in best with their family. They would give it a few days, they said, and then make their choice. That night, lying in bed in an unfamiliar bedroom, in an unfamiliar house at the Dongducheon American military base, little Milton made his second big decision of the day - and ran away. ""I didn't want to get taken back to the orphanage - maybe they wouldn't choose me,"" he says. ""I was just trying to get to America."" Before his life in the orphanage, Milton was the only black child in a small village near the border with North Korea. Milton's father, an American soldier, was long gone, but his mother, who worked hard days in the rice fields, loved him and protected him fiercely against the prejudice they encountered. The children in Milton's South Korean village would sing a song about red apples, bananas, a train - and a monkey. ""I remember the part of the song they sang to me the loudest. The part about the black monkey's butt being red. That set the tone,"" he says. It was just an innocent playground song on the face of it - it wasn't racist, or at least, not designed to be. But they turned it into something hurtful: a way to single him out for the colour of his skin. As the son of a black man, he says, he fell ""outside of the limits"" of what it meant to be Korean in the '60s and '70s. And because his father was not Korean, he had no right to a birth certificate. Milton knew that his father was from the US - in his mind a land of flying cars, where the cities were made of gold, with ice-cream mountains. ""I dreamed of going to America because it was full of black people - these magical creatures,"" Milton says, ""and of being accepted."" Milton's America was a fantasy land that couldn't have been more different from his reality. He and his mother lived in a mud and stone hut, slept on the floor, and washed their clothes in the river. One morning, village elders arrived at the door and told Milton's mother they would no longer accept ""the shame that you're bringing upon this village because of that boy"". Although Milton's mother argued their case, she and Milton left their home and moved to a nearby town attached to an American military base. There were cars there, electricity, and money, all of which were new to Milton - salt had been the currency in their village. Milton also saw black American soldiers for the first time, and felt a step closer to finding his father. Milton Washington spoke to Lives Less Ordinary on BBC World Service In the alleys of the red-light district below their tiny apartment, homeless boys begged, picked pockets, and fought with other gangs. The American soldiers called them ""slickyboys"" - slang for little thieves. And when six-year-old Milton shared a packet of Oreos with the boys - given to him by his mum's American boyfriend - he became a slickyboy too. Milton finally felt like he belonged. ""All the black soldiers would give me money - dollar bills, not just change,"" he says. ""It completely changed my life."" Milton's mother had become a sex worker in a club in town and went out at night to work. Milton was left alone in their apartment - under strict instruction not to leave, instructions he routinely ignored. One night Milton's mum didn't return from work as expected - the club had been raided by the police and she and all the other women who worked there were sent to jail for two weeks. Free of his mother's rules, Milton and his friends ran wild, stealing drinks from bars and having adventures all over town. When his mum returned, she made sure Milton was never left alone again. Each time she got wind of a police raid, she would drop Milton at an orphanage for a couple of weeks so that he was safe. Milton remembers being racially abused by the other, mostly Korean, kids at these orphanages, as he had been in the village growing up. But this time, he didn't let it get to him. ""I would almost laugh it off,"" he says. ""'Yeah, I may be these racial slurs that you're talking about - but you're the orphan. I have a mother, she says she's going to be back in two weeks.' And she was always back in two weeks."" For a while, this routine continued. Then one morning, Milton and his mum took a taxi to a different orphanage, where many of the children looked like Milton. It was an orphanage for children born to American servicemen and Korean mothers, called the St Vincent's home for Amerasian children. Milton's mum assured him she'd be back the following day and promised him a present - he asked for a train set. But when she returned there was no train set, just a hug that he didn't know meant goodbye. ""She told me, 'I need you to be strong,'"" he says. ""That was the last time I saw her."" It wasn't long after Milton first arrived at St Vincent's orphanage that Captain and Mrs Washington took him to their home on a military base - from where he decided to run away. He didn't get far. He was still small and the compound fences were high, and a search party found him, hours later, sound asleep in a children's playground. But the incident shook the Washingtons, who decided that both Milton and Joseph could stay with them permanently. The boys were adopted in 1977 and eventually moved to America - becoming part of a noisy, loving family of six children, who rode bikes, played sports, and went to school - all the normal childhood things Milton had longed for. But he worried about what had become of his mother and would cry himself to sleep. He was haunted by dreams of wading through paddy fields looking for her. She had always been his ""island of refuge in a very tough world"", he says. Now in his 50s - he's not sure of his exact age - Milton works as a photographer in New York and is writing a memoir called ""Slickyboy"". He's always remained curious about his biological family, and in recent years began to look for connections via DNA websites. In April 2019, he got a hit. It was a family member on his mother's side, who wanted to speak to him immediately. ""Hello, I'm calling from Seattle,"" the voice - with a strong Korean accent - said. ""This is Milton-ah (little Milton),"" he said, using the name his birth mother had often called him. ""I am your sister, Tong, do you remember me?"" Milton did remember meeting Tong - she was one of his older sisters, and they had met a handful of times in Korea when Milton was a little boy. Tong had lived with their grandparents, from whom Milton's mother was estranged. Speaking to his half-sister, Milton says, was ""an incredible moment"". ""I was just really excited [to be] connected with my past, and to have my memories validated by her."" Milton had not expected his mother to survive, but Tong told him she'd lived a long life, and had died just a few years previously. His mother and sisters had come to the US in 1998, and though they knew that Milton was living there too, Milton's mum had felt she had no right to contact him. But she had left a keepsake for Milton with Tong - a gold and jade necklace to remember her by. ""It's a beautiful piece,"" he says. ""It's a way to carry my mother with me."" Milton keeps searching for answers about his father. He believes his dad likely came from Louisiana, but has little more information. ""I want to know what kind of man he is. He's the only missing link,"" Milton says. Despite the sadness he still sometimes feels, Milton is certain his mum made the right decision giving him up all those years ago. ""She knew that if I had a shot at an American life, I would do well at it. I love her for that act,"" he says. ""There is a hole in my heart that's always going to be there. But the benefits of my current life versus what it could have been - there's no argument there."" ",1593,world,2022-10-01T23:06:28.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62786001
South Asian diaspora recall gnawing loneliness in post-war Britain," The first generation who came to post-war Britain from the Indian subcontinent arrived with as little as £3 in their pockets - all the money they could bring in under strict currency controls. Their descendants, in their millions, are part of the make-up of contemporary Britain, but many of their stories are still to be told - and they reveal so much about the process of migration. Mohammed Ajeeb arrived in Britain in 1957 from Pakistan with a battered suitcase. His first home was in Nottingham with 28 other men from Mirpur, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. He'd had a clerical job in Pakistan but could only find work in a factory. ""I cried at night in my bed,"" he confesses. ""I wanted to go back but I didn't want to be seen as a failure. I thought, 'I'm a determined young man, I want to succeed by hook or crook in this country,' and that carried me."" Over the years, he fought many battles for equal pay and against racism - but he stayed and went on to become the mayor of Bradford. The 1948 British Nationality Act meant people who came from the former colonies or the empire automatically became British citizens. Britain needed workers to rebuild the country after World War Two. Many who came in the early years from the Indian subcontinent were single, young men. They mostly worked the difficult shifts in the factories, foundries, and textile mills in places like Birmingham, Bradford, and West London. These men thought they were coming for only a few years: they never imagined generations of their family would one day live here. Gnawing loneliness, and missing family, was part of life for these pioneers, the so-called £3 generation. Many wrote to their family on blue aerogram letters. Gunwant Grewal came over from Ludhiana, Punjab in 1965. Life wasn't what she had imagined. She had been a teacher in India, but could only find factory work when she arrived. She lived in a room in Southall, west London, with her husband and daughter in a shared house, a far cry from her spacious home in India. She desperately missed her father who she wrote to regularly. ""My tears were on my letter as I was writing. My father said, 'Why was your letter damp?' and I said, 'Oh I was having a cup of tea,' when really it was tears. But slowly, slowly it got better."" One time walking past a bus stop, she saw an elderly Sikh man who reminded her of her father. She spontaneously hugged him. A phone call to hear a loved one's voice was out of the question. Ravi Patel arrived in 1967 with £1, having spent the rest on the journey over to Britain. He recalls that phoning India cost £1.40 per minute, a vast sum then. So Ravi called his family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, twice a year: once on Diwali and once on his father's birthday. It remained that way until the early 2000s, when communications were revolutionised by companies like Lebara, which was started by three British-Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and offered cheap telephone calling cards. You could now phone the Indian subcontinent for as cheaply as one penny a minute. Decades after Ravi left India, he could now speak to his best friend whenever he wanted. When I started interviewing these pioneers nearly a decade ago, their experiences were not widely documented, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in the stories of people who came from the former empire and made their once colonial ruler home. And the struggles of that generation for equality and against racism are now better known. Each generation has a different attachment to the place left and the place where they now live - but these private, and sometimes delicate, tussles between parents and children are rarely recorded. I have been reporting on the ups and downs of the relationship between Farah Sayeed and her mother Runi, who came in 1968 as a young bride from Dhaka, East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Farah was born a year later. Runi's generation often bore and raised their children alone, without the support of their own mothers or any wider family. For the next generation, it was different. In late 2001, Farah was in Liverpool when she called her mother in London to tell her she was about to give birth. Runi says, ""I started to shiver and scream because I'm her mother and I should be near."" She jumped into the car and drove to Liverpool. She arrived to be told her grandchild had been born. ""That was the happiest moment of my life,"" Runi smiles, ""I am eternal now."" Waiting in the hospital corridor to see them jogged a memory. She remembered giving birth to Farah and writing a letter to her mother in then East Pakistan, saying she now realised what being a mum meant. Runi recalled lying in the hospital bed with her newborn, in pain, and how she missed her mother who was so far away. She was hungry and wanted to be comforted by her mother's food. So when, decades later, she walked into Farah's room and met her grandson, she remembered that hunger and ache for her own mother. She asked Farah what she wanted to eat. Chicken biryani, she replied. Runi searched Liverpool's halal shops and made that dish for her daughter. Three Pounds in My Pocket Series 5 starts on Friday 8 April at 11:00 BST on BBC Radio 4. You can hear the previous series on BBC Sounds Farah, after giving birth to her son, had her own revelation. ""Within seconds of becoming a mum, I had a completely different appreciation of what my mum must have gone through. She didn't have any real extended family around, compared to how supported I felt."" Five years later, in 2006, Farah had another child and decided to return to London, to be near her mother. She had left the family home in 1988 wanting to get away from the burden of her parents' expectations, with a yearning to live her own life, her way. In deciding to come back to be near her parents, she wanted to give her children something she never had - grandparents. Hers had lived in Bangladesh and she barely saw them. Hearing Farah, I realised that there must be many thousands from the second generation, born in Britain, who grew up orphaned from their grandparents. This relationship between our children and their grandparents - the pioneers - has such a precious meaning for us, as it was something we never had. For Farah, life had come full circle. She wanted her children to be immersed in Bengali food, culture and language - things that were so much a part of her parents' home. It was the same home Farah had wanted to escape in the late 1980s. ""When you're young, you want to fit in, and when you're older, you're just confident - fitting in matters less than the things that made you who you are."" Testimonies like these are an important part of the story of migration and the story of Britain. What began as an empire ended up with former subjects of the Raj settling as citizens, with generations now living here. Each individual making a choice about what to discard from the place left behind and what to hold on to in Britain. Runi's husband died last year. Her voice breaks as she tells me, ""It feels like you build a house and you start with one brick. I built the whole big house over the years with him. We fought, we argued. But we wanted to build that house, and we did."" He is buried near their home in London. As a young man, he wanted to rest in Bangladesh's earth, in the family plot there. But later, he realised his home was where his children and grandchildren were. His centre of gravity had shifted. There had been many difficult and lonely times, but now three generations were successfully established in Britain. Runi tells me she has reserved a plot next to his. ""I feel that this is a big tree, solidly rooted into a land, and it cannot be pulled out."" ",1381,uk,2022-04-09T23:23:52.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60988410

UK farmers call for weedkiller ban over Parkinson’s fears," Some British farmers are calling for a ban on the UK production of toxic weedkiller Paraquat, saying studies suggest it could be a factor in the onset of Parkinson's Disease. It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them. Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements. He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment. ""Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,"" his wife Sue says. ""Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere."" She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical. ""Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?"" she asks. ""We've got a lot of people in the same situation."" Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale. It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths. Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies. Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's. The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. ""The farmers come here not because they're ill,"" Julie explains, ""but because they want to get on with living."" Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease. Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. ""He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used."" He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. ""He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down."" John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years. Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. ""It's a horrible disease,"" says his wife Sue. ""It's taken his life away."" She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. ""I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father."" Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world. In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities. Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year. The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further. Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action. He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. ""If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,"" he says. ""The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?"" There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's. In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was ""a well-recognised environmental risk factor"" but Parkinson's UK said studies show ""a small increased risk"" at most. In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users. But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found. But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health. Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies ""citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat"". He explains: ""Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's."" It said: ""In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company. We spent tens of millions of dollars investigating Paraquat and Parkinson's disease - and this figure doesn't include the monetary value of internal expert time."" In a statement, Syngenta said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the product lifetime to ensure its safety. ""Paraquat has been the subject of more than 1,200 safety studies submitted to, and reviewed by, regulatory authorities around the world. Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities including the United States and Australia continue to support the view that Paraquat is safe.""

Growing up around land-mines: How the Falklands conflict shaped me," On Friday 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands. It had claimed sovereignty over the islands for many years. The country's ruling military junta did not believe that Britain would attempt to regain the islands by force. The ruling military junta was wrong. Britain, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, assembled warships, refitted merchant ships and sent a task force 8,000 miles (12,900 km) across the globe to the South Atlantic. Over the next 10 weeks, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed. Forty years on, Tamsin McLeod, an islander who grew up in the shadow of the conflict and now lives in London, tells the BBC what her homeland means to her - and how the island families coped with their peaceful lives being thrust into the arena of war. ""Our nickname is 'Kelper' because of all the seaweed and kelp surrounding the islands, so I'm a Kelper or Falklander first and British second, and on the islands we are so, so eternally grateful for what the British did. I probably wouldn't be here today if that task force had not been sent. ""My parents didn't really talk about it to me much as I grew up. ""It was something that happened, where you have the Liberation Day and the parades and the receptions, and you attend them and everything. And it's very personal. ""But the older I've become the more my parents have opened up about it. My parents would say in passing, 'oh, yeah, your aunt and uncle were locked in the Goose Green town hall for 30 days'."" During the war more than 100 islanders were held at gunpoint and imprisoned in the community hall at Goose Green. They had been summoned to a meeting there by Argentine officials. They were kept at the hall, in appalling conditions, for nearly a month. In just two months of hostilities in the Falklands, 891 men died, 132 aircraft were lost, and 11 ships were sunk. ""It was always there. It's always in the background. It's the legacy of the conflict - especially with the landmines. It was completely normal to be surrounded by bits of land you couldn't go on, fenced off because there were landmines and if you step on one you could die. ""So going on a walk, it was like, 'oh, yeah, here's wreckage from a helicopter or something from the war'. ""When the invasion happened, my mum was completing her O-levels. Imagine these being interrupted for three months, because you're being occupied and you're being told you have to learn everything in Spanish. ""All of a sudden, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road, you've got a curfew. ""My mum really, really vividly remembers Argentine soldiers turning up at her doorstep because my granddad was the local butcher at the time, and they were like, 'you need to kill mutton and feed us'. ""And my granddad - he was born in England, he vaguely remembers the Second World War, and he did his national service before moving to the islands. And so he's like, 'I'm not putting my family at risk'. So he shipped his whole family out to Horseshoe Bay, which is another farming settlement in the middle of nowhere. ""And that's my mum's main experience of the war - her dad being genuinely fearful."" Margaret Thatcher addressed the House of Commons on 3 April: ""We are here because for the first time for many years British sovereign territory has been invaded by a foreign power. ""After several days of rising tension in our relations with Argentina, that country's armed forces attacked the Falklands yesterday and established military control of the islands … By late afternoon yesterday it became clear that an Argentine invasion had taken place and that the lawful British government of the islands had been usurped. ""There is not a shred of justification and not a scrap of legality to the invasion. The Falkland Islands and their dependencies remain British territory - no aggression and no invasion can alter that simple fact. ""It is the government's objective to see that the islands are freed from occupation and are returned to British administration at the earliest possible moment."" ""My dad is slightly older. He turned 18 in April during the conflict, he and his brother were helping feed and cook for the British soldiers. They gave their car, their motorbike, the jeep. People stayed on their floor. They were trying to do as much as they could. ""My dad was a young man at that time and there were people his age dying, soldiers dying. ""You couldn't really escape it. But then in a positive way, you appreciate how lucky you are, how privileged you are. To call yourself a Falkland Islander, to be six generations to grow up here, to have a childhood surrounded by penguins and beaches, to have insanely good fresh air."" ""The way I grew up, it was 'appreciate what you've got, because we could have really not had this'. ""When I came to the UK, people knew nothing about the Falklands, genuinely nothing. Especially people my age. ""Occasionally some mention penguins - and sometimes you meet a friend's parents in their 40s or 50s and they remember the conflict. ""It's like, 'I remember hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on the television. Wasn't there a war in the 80s? Wasn't Margaret Thatcher involved?' ""That's all they knew."" ""I grew up there, it's my home. So it was completely normal. I didn't know anything different until I moved away and then went, 'oh, hang on a second, there's a whole wide world here'. ""There's still such a strong, strong feeling. My parents are still really close with lots of veterans. They're genuinely family friends. ""My godmother lost her son on the Sir Galahad. She came to the Falklands to see where he lost his life. And it's terrible, terrible circumstances. I don't think a mother should ever have to do that. And she stayed with my family and returned to the island several times since that original visit. ""And because of that relationship, she became a really important part of my life."" On 8 June, while preparing to unload soldiers from the Welsh Guards in Port Pleasant, RFA Sir Galahad was attacked by the Argentine Air Force, each carrying three Mk 82 500lb (227kg) bombs. Sir Galahad was hit by two or three bombs, which exploded and started fires. The explosions and subsequent fire caused the deaths of 48 crew and soldiers. ""People should care about the war. People lost their lives. ""We are very resilient. We fight for what we believe in and we really want to continue to fight to be British. ""The island has moved on from the war. We have made the most of the sacrifices lost. We still remember the past and we appreciate everything that's happened. But we're looking to the future now. ""We do not have a positive relationship with Argentina at all. It's not civil at all. ""We are not just statistics and geography - we have heritage, we have history, we have lived experiences that are very valuable to us. ""We're becoming the gateway to Antarctica on that entire side of the world, which is amazing. We're the scientific hub of the South Atlantic. We have more than 60 different nationalities, including a growing population from Zimbabwe due to the de-miners coming and removing the landmines, so we are really cosmopolitan. And we're really proud of that. ""I probably will go back. It's home. It's where my family are. I love going home and visiting them and seeing friends. It's a lot slower. ""That soil is my home. So I carry a piece of it with me wherever I go. My necklace has Falklands sand in it and I promise you, it does not come off. Ever. ""The Falklands are a part of me and I'm a part of them."" Tamsin's story is taken from My Moment in History - a BBC Local Radio podcast focusing on people whose lives have been affected by the Falklands War.

India population: The job crisis driving millions to big cities," India is in the throes of a massive move to its cities - the second largest rural to urban migration in human history. This demographic disruption is under way as the country is set to overtake China to become the most populous in the world - the UN projects that will happen by the middle of this year. Experts say that India's new status highlights its demographic dividend as the nation with the largest number of young workers - but also its biggest challenge: creating enough jobs for them. And that's what's fuelling the migration - people don't make enough money in the villages, so they're streaming out of the countryside by the tens of millions, driven by hope and desperation to seek better opportunities in big cities. In India's financial hub Mumbai recently, a crush of young men surged forward as policemen waved batons and called for order. The candidates had come from all over the state seeking a coveted spot in the police force. Competition was fierce: there were 650,000 applicants and only 8,000 positions. That's why Sunil Bamble was trying for a third time, he'd travelled more than 200km (124 miles) for another chance. ""If I get this job my life will change because I will receive a fixed income,"" he told me, raising his hand in a prayer for success as he finished his paperwork. ""I will have job security. I'll be able to get married."" That kind of anxiety is reflected in a UN report released this week. It noted that 63% of Indians were most concerned about economic issues when it came to population-related matters. The country's economy is growing at a fast pace, creating a big market for the world. But its rate of unemployment stands at a high of 8%, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think-tank. That's especially true among young people who get an education but not the kind needed to keep up with the boom in high-end services, like software and finance, which are powering that growth. Hence, they aim to get secure government positions, such as in the police force. If Mr Bamble doesn't get that job of his dreams, he says he'll still move to the city, even though it will be a hustle. ""There are many more options for employment, but also more hardships,"" he says. ""I'll have to pay much more for things here than I do in the village and I won't be able to live comfortably,"" Mr Bamble adds. ""But I'm ready to move here."" That's a gamble many in the suburb of Nala Sopara have made. It's a migrant community on the outskirts of Mumbai that's grown by 200% in the past 20 years. In a low-income housing area, washing hangs from the windows in narrow alleyways and children cluster around the doorways. Inside some of the darkened rooms, women are twisting together coils and plastic, making hair clips. It's modest work - but helps them earn a living. ""I can buy myself what I want,"" says 33-year-old Ranjana Vishwakarma, with a laugh. ""I can buy myself a sari! Or I can get something that my child needs - a book or something for school, like a pencil or eraser. I no longer need to depend on my husband for everything."" Her son sits quietly in the single room they share alongside a kitchen, studying. She has lived this way for 10 years, but believes he'll have a better future than she did. ""He is getting his education in the city so he will make something of it,"" she says, ""get a job and move forward in life."" Her neighbour Vishal Dubey comes from the same northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. He works as a salesman for an internet company which involves tough 12-hour days with long commutes. But he's able to help out his father, who drives a rickshaw, and pay for his mother's medical bills. Recently he registered to buy a house, for which he will pay in instalments. These are ""small dreams,"" he's able to fulfil, but he also dreams big. ""I hope I'm able to earn so much that I'm able to help people in my home-town,"" he says. ""I want my village to become rich, so that the people of my village don't have to become migrants and move to the city. They shouldn't have to face the struggles I'm facing."" But that might be a dream out of step with India's reality. It's estimated that at least 800 million Indians will live in urban centres by the middle of the century, which would be more than half of the population. How India manages to keep pace with the hopes - and despairs - of its people will largely be determined in the country's teeming cities. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Myanmar civil war: Children perish as bombs rain on resistance," ""The earth shook,"" says cattle farmer Win Zaw, recalling the sunny morning last week when he heard a military aircraft approaching, and then an explosion. He didn't think it was his village - Pa Zi Gyi in north-east Myanmar - that had been hit. But when he phoned his wife, he learnt that the military had bombed the place where villagers had gathered for a rare feast of curried noodles, rice and pork. Their seven-year-old daughter, Soe Nandar Nwe, had been among them. He says he rushed to the site of the attack and tried looking for her among the carnage. ""I searched for my daughter in the smoke, and through the charred remains. All I could think of was finding her."" He was looking for any sign of her favourite outfit - a white, floral dress that she wore that day. But he says he found no trace of her, or his mother-in-law who had been with her when the bomb fell. Villagers later told the BBC that a military jet dropped a bomb where people had gathered for the meal, and then a helicopter gunship fired at the village for 20 minutes. ""I still can't believe it,"" Win Zaw says. ""How could they have done this to defenceless, vulnerable little children?"" Two years after a coup plunged Myanmar into a civil war, the country's military rulers have increasingly taken to the skies to reduce resistance literally to ashes. Last Tuesday's attack, which killed 168 men, women and children, is among the deadliest so far. Last year, the military struck a school, killing several children, and later that month, a bombing of a concert killed about 50 people. Between February 2021 and January 2023, there had been at least 600 air attacks by the military, according to a BBC analysis of data from the conflict-monitoring group Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project). The civil war has claimed thousands of lives, displaced some 1.4 million people and left nearly a third of the country's population in need of humanitarian aid. The United Nations has said the regime could be liable for crimes against humanity and war crimes. The attacks target villages that are thought to be aligned with the resistance, which now comprises ethnic armed groups; a loose network of local volunteer militias known as People's Defence Force or PDFs; and the exiled National Unity Government, which was formed after the coup. In Pa Zi Gyi, the regime said it specifically targeted the village because it had opened an administrative office for the local PDF, which is affiliated to the NUG. The office and the feast to celebrate its opening were an unacceptable sign of the community's resistance. For Soe Nandar Nwe, it was simply an opportunity to show off her favourite floral dress. The night before she had told her father how excited she was for the neighbourhood event. ""I've never called my daughter by her name, always daddy's sweetheart. And she loved me."" One of their favourite things to do together, he says, was to take bike rides together, with her on the back seat, hugging him. That night, Soe Nandar Nwe insisted on sleeping by her father's side. His last memory of her was when he kissed her before leaving for work the next morning. She was still sleeping. Win Zaw says his daughter was a smart girl who wanted to be a teacher. ''She loved helping her friends study. We wanted her to grow up and achieve big things for the country because our country is going through a very difficult time."" Win Zaw imagined coming home that morning to loud music because the village had not celebrated even a wedding since the coup in 2021 that ousted Myanmar's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. He was supposed to take his daughter to the feast, but she had been so excited to go that her mother dropped her off at the venue earlier than planned, with her grandmother. They were inside a pandal or makeshift tent at the centre of the festivities when the attack began. It was the first air strike on Pa Zi Gyi although the region, Sagaing, which is home to some of the fiercest resistance to military rule, has been subject to several such attacks. Farmer Ye Naing also lost both his parents and his three-year-old daughter Hnin Yu Wai in the air strike. That morning before the attack, Ye Naing helped his daughter apply thanakha or face paint made from tree bark, traditionally worn to celebrations. She was among many children who had gathered for the feast before heading to school because meals like that have become a luxury in a country devastated by violence. The bomb fell just as the children were eating, said Ye Naing, who sustained injuries from shrapnel. ""My daughter must not even have finished a small bowl of rice,"" he said. ""My baby must not have had a cup of water."" ""That day, it felt like the end of the world or worse than that. But I'm not afraid. This was inhumane and barbaric. As long as they are oppressing and killing innocent people. I will fight back, along with the people of the country,"" he said. Ye Naing said his daughter was the darling of the village because she was friendly and thoughtful. When she saw him tired after a day's work, she would ask her mother to give him water and a snack. Nearly every one of the 200-odd households in Pa Zi Gyi lost a loved one that day. Villagers say some survivors left their homes and went into hiding, fearing more attacks. Others are rattled by loud sounds, such as motorcycle engines. ""We are just poor farmers. Don't watch us being killed. How many more innocent lives need to be sacrificed before you take action?"" Win Zaw said. Addressing General Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the military government, he said: ''I will never forgive him."" Moe Myint is a journalist for the BBC Burmese Service based in London.
