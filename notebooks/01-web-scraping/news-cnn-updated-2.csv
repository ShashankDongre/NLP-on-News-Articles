      Kids under 6 were increasingly treated for illicit substance ingestion after Covid-19’s start, study says
    ","The outbreak of Covid-19 presented many dangers for children, and a new study suggests increased illicit substance ingestions were among them. In the first month of the pandemic in 2020, a 25% increase in overall ingestions occurred among children under 6 years old in the United States, according to the study published Friday in JAMA Network Open. Those numbers grew by 1.8% more per month than they did before the pandemic, the study said. “The immediate and sustained increase in opioids ingestions occurred during the largest ever rise in adult overdose deaths, largely driven by synthetic opioids,” said lead study author Dr. Brittany Raffa, a clinical instructor in pediatrics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a National Research Service Award primary care research fellow. The study looked at data from 7,659 children under age 6 who were treated for ingestion of amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, ethanol and opioids across 46 children’s hospitals, the study said. “This is an important study, with a clear indication of the ongoing and elevated risk of drug and alcohol ingestions for young children in the US,” said Dr. James Dodington, associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Dodington was not involved in the study. More research would be needed to know why ingestions by children went up, but the study stressed a need to identify interventions around parental mental health, offer substance treatment services,  provide accessible childcare and educate adults about storing substances. “Families were left without adequate child supervision with most childcare centers and schools closed or virtual (during the early part of the pandemic),” Raffa said in an email. “As overall stress and parental substance use increased, substance use treatment centers and mental health care were disrupted.” Dodington said, “Notably, the cannabis and opioid ingestion elevations are stark, and this study points to the need to develop more comprehensive childhood ingestion prevention strategies.” Those ingestions that rose in children were similar to substances that appear to have increased in usage by adults in the pandemic, although some research has differing information on drug use trends, said Dr. Danielle Ompad, professor of epidemiology at New York University. Ompad was not involved in the study. The results could be skewed if health care providers were on the lookout for ingestions, Dodington added. “Given the increase in opioid and cannabis use across the US, healthcare providers may be testing more often for children, and we may be detecting a greater number of ingestions,” he said in an email. As concerning as these ingestions can be, Ompad noted that there’s not any information on where or how they happened — so, the public should not be quick to blame parents or caregivers. There was no association between medicinal or recreational cannabis legalization and the rate of cannabis ingestion encounters, according to the study. Ingesting drugs and alcohol are particularly dangerous for young children, Dodington said. When it comes to edible marijuana products, a single snack could have several times the recommended adult dose of THC, Dr. Brian Johnston, an executive committee member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Council on Injury, Violence and Poisoning Prevention, said in a 2021 CNN article. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive compound in cannabis that produces the high sensation. “Anyone who eats one of these products — especially a child — can experience overdose effects such as intoxication, altered perception, anxiety, panic, paranoia, dizziness, weakness, slurred speech, poor coordination, or even breathing and heart problems,” said Johnston, who was not involved in this week’s study. Researchers and policymakers need to take action to prevent ingestions and educate and support parents and guardians about the risks to children, Dodington said. And along with mental health and addiction interventions, education efforts should focus on safe storage — especially of edibles, he said. Ideally, people living with or visited by children should not store drugs at home or in a place where youngsters have access to, Ompad said. If you do use drugs and store them at home, make sure they are locked up when children are around and are in a childproof-container or safe, she added. “This is particularly true for cannabis edibles or any other drug that looks like food or sweets — they are tempting to kids,” Ompad said.

      How to exercise when you have a chronic condition or a disability
    ","Many people struggle to maintain a regular workout regimen. Add in a disability, chronic condition or injury, and it can be even more challenging to incorporate exercise into a weekly routine. Yet it’s important to do so. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to develop serious health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer than those without disabilities, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the impact of these health conditions can be lessened or possibly even avoided with regular aerobic exercise, nearly half of adults ages 18 to 64 with a disability are not engaging in any, the CDC says. “Regular exercise can provide many benefits for people with disabilities, including improved overall health, increased strength and endurance, better mobility, and improved mental health,” said Lalitha McSorley, owner and lead physical therapist at Brentwood Physiotherapy Clinic in Calgary, Alberta. Regular exercise can also help manage the symptoms associated with some disabilities. For example, exercise can reduce the pain and stiffness that often accompanies arthritis, and it can improve cognitive function in people with cognitive issues, she said. Additionally, a consistent workout routine can boost self-esteem and provide valuable socialization and community engagement. In 2020, the World Health Organization released the first global public health guidelines regarding physical activity for those with disabilities and chronic conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and cancer. These guidelines are the same as the US Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for all adults: Every week you should do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equal combination of both. In addition, you should perform muscle-strengthening activities two or more days per week. Which types of exercise are appropriate and helpful will depend upon your specific health situation. In general, some good options are swimming, walking, water aerobics, cycling and seated workouts, said Bishnu Pada Das, a certified personal trainer based in Kolkata, India. Examples of seated workouts include using a hand cycle and performing chair exercises with or without weights. Chair exercises can be as simple as power punches in which you punch your arms in front of you in an alternating fashion, Das said, or alternating kicks, which involve holding your chair for support, then alternating leg kicks. Even torso rotations are beneficial, twisting from side to side and using your arms to help with the rotations. Activities such as water aerobics and pool running are favored by Dr. Heather Swain, a physical therapist at Ally Total Physical Therapy in Toledo, Ohio. “The reduced gravity with aquatic exercise helps people to be more mobile,” Swain said. “It can be empowering to see your body move and accomplish movements you couldn’t outside of the water.” The hydrostatic pressure of the water also helps enhance blood flow and reduces inflammation. If you don’t have easy access to a pool, Swain considers yoga a great, and often underrated, option. Yoga can help maintain flexibility and balance, no matter your skill level, which reduces your risk of injury, she said. In addition, the breath work involved benefits pelvic health, back pain, cognitive function and mental health. Those with joint issues may benefit more from isometric exercises in which you tighten a certain muscle or muscle groups. Think exercises such as planks, squats and wall sits. Isometric exercises help maintain muscle strength while preventing further muscle deterioration. If you have lower-body issues or are unsteady on your feet, chair aerobics are a good choice. Using rapid, repetitive motions, such as doing bicep curls or marching in place, chair aerobics workouts can loosen stiff joints while boosting your heart rate. Adding in dumbbells or resistance bands incorporates strength training, too. Performing chair yoga, or even stretching throughout the day, aids in flexibility and can help reduce the pain and muscle pressure that can come when you sit for long periods of time. No matter what form of exercise you decide on, several factors can help ensure your success. Schedule your workouts for the time of day you tend to feel best, said certified personal trainer Kelly Borowiec, founder of Keebs Fitness in Saratoga, California. It also helps to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible while exercising. “If you struggle with arthritis, increase the room temperature where you’ll be exercising,” said Borowiec, who has extensive experience working with clients who have disabilities or long-term injuries. “Set goals, too, as having a physical disability doesn’t mean you can’t make progress. And focus on what you can do, rather than what you can’t do.” Swain agreed. “It can be easy to focus on your limitations,” she said. “Exercising can remind you of what your body can do, and can give you a sense of empowerment and accomplishment that is valuable to your self-efficacy.” ",802,health,2023-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/health/how-to-modify-workout-disability-wellness/index.html

      Australia unveils biggest defense overhaul in decades with wary eye on China
    ","Australia has unveiled a radical shakeup of its defense spending billed as the most significant review of its military preparedness since World War II, shifting its emphasis onto long-range strike capabilities and building munitions at home. Launching the Defense Strategic Review in Canberra, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government’s strategy was designed to make Australia more self reliant, more prepared and more secure. “We cannot fall back on old assumptions. We must build and strengthen our security by seeking to shape the future rather than waiting for the future to shape us,” Albanese said. The review examined billions of dollars committed by the previous government and reassessed their value against perceived threats, including from an increasingly muscular China under leader Xi Jinping. Though the unclassified version of the report didn’t include confidential assessments of specific threats, it noted that Australia’s largest defense ally, the United States, is “no longer the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific”. “China’s assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia’s national interests,” the review said. The highest level of strategic risk that Australia now faces is the prospect of a major conflict in the region, the review added, suggesting a strategy of greater self-sufficiency combined with stronger relationships with its allies and key powers in the region, including Japan and India. For decades, Australia’s remoteness fostered the assumption that any attack would come with a 10-hour warning. Now, countries are able to “project combat power” through assaults on supply routes and cyber warfare, the review said. “The rise of the ‘missile age’ in modern warfare… has radically reduced Australia’s geographic benefits (and) the comfort of distance,” the report said. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic had exposed Australia’s vulnerability to global supply chains, Albanese told reporters, meaning it was necessary for the country to become more self-sufficient. “We need to have greater control over our national sovereignty. So not only is manufacturing things in Australia, good for jobs and good for our economy, there’s also a national security issue,” he said. Defense Minister Richard Marles said the defense posture that had served Australia well for decades was “no longer fit for purpose” and the review recasts the mission of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Its new redefined purpose is to defend the nation, project power to its northern approaches, and to maintain the global rules based order with its allies, Marles said. The review recommended Australia adopt a “strategy of denial,” defined as “a defensive approach designed to stop an adversary from succeeding in its goal to coerce states through force, or the threatened use of force, to achieve dominance.” To that end, the review recommended six priorities starting with developing a nuclear powered submarine program, previously announced under the AUKUS deal with the United States and the United Kingdom. It also recommends speeding up the acquisition of long-range strike missiles and manufacturing munitions within Australia. The country also wants to improve its defense cooperation with regional neighbors, particularly in the Pacific. Technical requirements include the need to upgrade the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft to operate long-range anti-ship missile systems. An urgent recruitment campaign is also needed to boost the ADF workforce, including the numbers of workers in shipyards to expand the submarine force. The shuffling of priorities means funding for some programs will be cut. For example, plans to purchase 450 Infantry Fighting Vehicles have been slashed to just 129. The money saved will be spent on more HIMARS rocket systems, which have been used to deadly effect in Ukraine, and landing crafts, to give the army greater mobility. The Infantry Fighting Vehicles were to have been sourced from either Hanwha Defense Australia and Rheinmetall Defence Australia, the two shortlisted tenders that are Australian arms of South Korean and German companies. The government has already held talks with the governments of those countries, said Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy. “An infantry fighting vehicle capability is an important part of a modern Australian army. But we also need the capacity to deploy them and that’s why we’re investing in landing craft medium and heavy and investing in a generational change in long range strike for the Australian Army as well,” Conroy said. Previous shifts in Australia’s defense procurement plans have angered allies, particularly France, which fumed over the former government’s cancellation of a 90 billion dollar ($60 billion) submarine deal in favor of the AUKUS program. This government has vowed to be more nimble in making decisions about defence projects, streamlining those that are considered more strategically important. The review pointed to the need for the Australian government to “abandon its pursuit of the perfect solution.” “The pursuit of the perfect has often been done at the expense of time. There is an opportunity cost and a capability cost associated with that. So we need to rebalance that,” said Marles.

      Another cheetah has died after relocation to India, the second in less than a month
    ","A cheetah from Africa has died two months after being reintroduced to India as part of an intercontinental effort to revive the big cat in the country, the second animal from the program to have passed away in less than a month. India’s wildlife department said the male, called Uday, died at the Kuno National Park on Sunday in central Madhya Pradesh state, according to CNN’s affliate News18. The cause of death was not immediately known and authorities will perform a post-mortem to find out more, the outlet reported. Uday – who was named by Indian citizens in a contest – was among 20 cheetahs airlifted to India over the past few months from Africa. The Indian government’s ultimate plan is to introduce 50 big cats over the next five years. The news of the deceased 6-year-old cheetah came just three weeks after his fellow feline, Sasha, died from a kidney infection. Uday was one of 12 cheetahs flown across the ocean from South Africa in February. Sasha hails from another group of eight sent from Namibia in September last year. South African veterinarian Adrian Tordiffe, who helped coordinate the move earlier, said experts were investigating various possibilities and awaiting tests for further confirmation. “At this stage, it appears to be a rare random cause that is unlikely to pose any risk to the other cheetahs,” he said, adding that possible causes could range from severe botulism to a snake bite. Laurie Marker, founder of the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which also helped with transferring the animals, said re-establishing a population is very difficult. “Losses are to be expected and for unexpected reasons,” he said. “We are looking at populations which individuals are a part of and we all care about these individuals, but we also have to think of the big picture.” While two cheetahs have died since being reintroduced, the overall population has nonetheless grown. In late March, the country welcomed four newborn cheetahs for the first time since the species disappeared from India more than 70 years ago. Cheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952, but the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change hopes they’ll be able to bring the species back. The animals chosen were selected “based on an assessment of health, wild disposition, hunting skills, and ability to contribute genetics that will result in a strong founder population,” according to CCF’s earlier statement. The cheetahs were first sent to a quarantine enclosure before being moved to acclimatization zones and eventually released into the park’s hunting enclosures. Cheetahs are found in southern and eastern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, and Tanzania, with less than 7,000 left in the wild, according to the World Wide Fund (WWF).

      Residents in South Florida condo building have until Tuesday to evacuate after building deemed unsafe
    ","Residents of a South Florida condo building have been ordered to evacuate by Tuesday after the building was deemed unsafe during its 60-year building recertification. During an inspection on April 14, a building engineer found the Majestic Isle condominium building in North Bay Village had sagging floors and termite damage and deemed it structurally unsafe. A recent leak from a roof drain caused a partial ceiling collapse last week and residents from five units had already been evacuated, according to a release from the city. The Majestic Isle building was built in 1960 and has 36 units with about 55 residents, the release said. “It’s the first time we’ve ever had a situation like this in North Bay Village,” said Mayor Brent Latham. “Everyone is working very, very hard to respond and lend a helping hand in this crisis situation for some of our neighbors,” he said late Thursday. Latham said he is working with Miami-Dade County officials and hotels to provide temporary housing for the residents. Residents will be allowed back inside their units at a later date for a complete move-out, according to the release. Officials are collecting donations through The Miami Foundation to help the displaced. “We’re just doing everything we can for our residents. We do have a lot of families that are in difficult situations,” said Latham. North Bay Village, located on land in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach, is about four miles from Surfside. Ninety-eight people died in 2021 when the Champlain Towers South condo building partially collapsed in the middle of the night in Surfside.

      Alabama early education secretary resigns as Gov. Ivey decries ‘woke’ resource book
    ","The head of early childhood education in Alabama has been ousted after Gov. Kay Ivey learned of “woke concepts” in a resource book for pre-K teachers, officials said. Barbara Cooper, secretary of the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE), resigned after Ivey asked her to stop the use of the book, according to a Friday news release from Ivey’s office. The governor made the decision to “have a change in leadership” in the department. The release says the manual argues that there are “larger systemic forces that perpetuate systems of White privilege” and that “the United States is built on systemic and structural racism.” Also included, according to Ivey’s office, is the need for four-year-olds to understand that “LGBTQIA+ need to hear and see messages that promote equality, dignity and worth.” CNN has reached out to Cooper for comment. Ivey’s office said it learned earlier this month that the resource book has content “that is simply not in line with what the Ivey Administration or the people of Alabama stand for or believe.” Her office said the book is the fourth edition of “Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood Programs.” The work is put out by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), of which Cooper is a member. The NAEYC website says the book meets the challenges of the ever-changing nature of education. “With a strong focus on equity and teaching and supporting all children, it underscores the importance of social, cultural, and historical contexts of development.” In a statement to CNN after Cooper’s resignation, the NAEYC said the book has been a foundation for early-childhood education for nearly four decades. “While not a curriculum, it is a responsive, educator-developed, educator-informed, and research-based resource that has been honed over multiple generations to support teachers in helping all children thrive and reach their full potential,” the association said. CNN has not reviewed a copy of the training book. Gov. Ivey, in a statement, said the education of Alabama children is her top priority. “There is absolutely no room to distract or take away from this mission. Let me be crystal clear: Woke concepts that have zero to do with a proper education and that are divisive at the core have no place in Alabama classrooms at any age level, let alone with our youngest learners. We want our children to be focused on the fundamentals, such as reading and math.” Ivey appointed Cooper in 2020. The governor did give some praise to the educator, saying she was a champion for computer science education and helped put more focus on students in lower-performing parts of the state. Dr. Jan Hume has been appointed to serve as interim secretary of the department. ",454,us,2023-04-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/us/alabama-early-childhood-education-secretary-resigns/index.html

      8 people, including 12-year-old girl, wounded in back-to-back shootings in Washington, DC, authorities say
    ","Eight people, including a 12-year-old girl, were injured in two back-to-back shootings in Washington, DC on Friday night – incidents that police are investigating as being connected. Around 10:00 p.m. ET, Metropolitan Police Department officers responded to sounds of gunshots in the district’s southwestern quadrant, officials said. When they arrived, police found seven men with non-life-threatening gunshot wounds. Most of the wounded took themselves to a local hospital, according to police. While investigating the shooting, police received a call about a second incident nearby. When officers arrived, they discovered a 12-year-old girl who had been shot. According to police, the girl is stable condition and her injuries were also non-life-threatening. Multiple shell casings were found at both scenes and police are asking for the community’s help in looking for a black sedan, “possibly a Mercedes,” that witnesses saw driving through the area, “indiscriminately” firing at people at the first shooting scene, police said. Authorities said they were still investigating what led to the second shooting. “We are investigating the scenes as being connected,” said Andre Wright, an assistant chief at the department. “It’s possible that they are not. However, given the locations, and the proximity of the event, I find it likely that the two scenes are connected.” Police are asking anyone with information to contact them.

      Guns belonging to Las Vegas massacre shooter destroyed, property sold with proceeds to be divided among victims’ families
    ","The estate of Stephen Paddock, the gambler who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, has been sold off by court order and the proceeds will be evenly divided among the loved ones of the victims he killed in Las Vegas in 2017, an attorney for the victims said. From his hotel room overlooking the Route 91 Harvest Festival, Paddock opened fire, killing dozens of innocent victims and wounding hundreds more. “This is absolute relief. We wanted to ensure that the families received small token of reparation from Paddock,” Las Vegas attorney Alice Denton told CNN of the final order being granted in court on Thursday, bringing to a close the six-year process of settling debts and selling assets. Most of the $1.4 million generated from Paddock’s estate was from properties in Henderson, Reno, and Mesquite, Nevada. After accounting and real estate fees, about $1.3 million will be evenly split among the survivors of 61 victims, according to a petition filed in Clark County District Court. That equates to approximately $21,300 each. Funds will be disbursed in the next four to six weeks, Denton said. Paddock’s heir – his mother – waived her rights to inherit anything from her son, as noted in a court filing reassigning her rights to the estates of the victims. CNN previously reported 58 people died in the shooting. Denton said two more died later, but she could not comment on the final victim of the 61 named in the petition. The official list of victims’ names remains under seal. In 2019, an anonymous donor gave $62,500 to cover the estimated value of Paddock’s weapons on the condition they be demolished. Of the 49 guns Paddock owned, 13 have been retained by the FBI and the rest were destroyed, said Denton, who shepherded the case pro bono. Keeping the guns out of the community was an important factor for Denton, who estimates that it cost her small firm about $200,000 in fees. “If we saved one life it was worth it,” she said. “This has been a case that we took on based on love and affection for our community,” Denton said. “It was a labor of love to ensure we live in a better, safer environment.” ",375,us,2023-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/us/las-vegas-2017-shooting-stephen-paddock/index.html

      Kentucky law allows guns used in shootings to be auctioned. The family of the Louisville bank shooter wants to stop that
    ","The firearm a 25-year-old man used this month to shoot and kill five of his colleagues at a bank in Kentucky is expected at some point to go up for auction – a practice set by a state law the shooter’s family and Louisville’s mayor say they want changed. The statute, in place since 2016, states that certain confiscated guns not retained for official use “shall be sold at public auction,” with some proceeds going to public safety programs. The law governs the inevitable future of weapons that live on long after anyone they were used against might have perished. And in a nation where infamous shootings rack up by the week, it sets a clear process for the firearms’ fate – in contrast with other cases, like the five-figure donation that ensured the 2017 Las Vegas shooter’s arsenal would be destroyed or the controversial private auction for the gun used to kill Trayvon Martin in Florida. Still, the family of the Louisville gunman – who was shot dead by police responding to the attack – “was aghast to learn Kentucky law mandated the assault rifle used in the horrific event … be sold to the highest bidder at public auction,” they said in a statement. And despite the law, they’re taking steps to see that the AR-15-style rifle – the weapon of choice of many US mass shooters – is legally destroyed, they said. Meantime, Louisville’s Democratic mayor, a day after carnage unfolded during a staff meeting at the Old National Bank branch, also decried the gun-auction protocol – and called for it to change. “Think about that: that murder weapon will be back on the streets one day,” Craig Greenberg said at a news conference. “It’s time to change this law and let us destroy illegal guns and destroy the guns that have been used to kill our friends and kill our neighbors.” Just six days before the April 10 massacre in Louisville, Connor Sturgeon went to a local gun dealership and legally bought the AR-15-style rifle he’d use to slaughter his coworkers, police have said. This past Monday, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took possession of the assault rifle – the first step in ensuring its legal destruction – said Sturgeon’s family, adding it’s also working with the Louisville Metro Police Department to see the weapon is finished. “This tragedy is yet another indication that meaningful, common sense gun safety measures must be enacted,” the family said in its statement, adding, “We respectfully urge the Kentucky state legislature to lead the way by changing Kentucky law to remove the gun auction provision.” The call for change is not about politics but “life and death,” said Greenberg, who also demanded from federal and state lawmakers “the autonomy to deal with (Louisville’s) unique gun violence epidemic.” “The laws we have now are enabling violence and murder,” Greenberg said, slamming the state law that requires law enforcement to put seized firearms up for auction to federally licensed firearms dealers with an appropriate  license. “We have to take action now. We need short-term action to end this gun violence epidemic now so fewer people die on our streets and in our banks, in our schools,” the mayor said. “I don’t care about finger-pointing. I don’t care about blame. I don’t care about politics. I’m only interested in working together with our state legislators to take meaningful action to save lives to prevent more tragic injuries and more death.” Gun enthusiasts have described Kentucky as “one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi,” while gun violence prevention groups like Everytown for Gun Safety have billed its laws as “among the worst in the country.” Kentucky also is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. “Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there’s no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they’re ever used in a crime,” said CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit focused on gun violence. While the Louisville shooter’s rifle remains in limbo, the case recalls the fate of other weapons used or owned by notorious American gunmen – and the ethical questions that cropped up as what would happen to their firearms was considered. gAn anonymous donor in 2019 gave $62,500 to ensure guns owned by the man who shot and killed 58 concertgoers in 2017 in Las Vegas were destroyed, said Alice Denton, the attorney for the special administrator of gunman Stephen Paddock’s estate. The collection as a whole was appraised at about $62,300. “The question becomes: If we liquidate these guns and sell these guns, which is required as part of the special administrator’s duty, we will be perpetuating the violence that actually caused the death of those individuals?” Denton told CNN in 2019. All of Paddock’s property has since been sold and all of his guns destroyed or taken out of circulation by the FBI after a federal judge in 2022 ordered the agency to destroy the majority of the firearms, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Separately, the man acquitted of second-degree murder in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin auctioned the firearm he used to kill the 17-year-old. George Zimmerman got his Kel Tec 9 pistol back after he was cleared of the charge. Zimmerman auctioned what he called “a piece of American history” on the United Gun Group auction site, with a final bidder possibly offering $138,900 for the firearm, according to the auction host site. The 9mm pistol carried a suggested price of $356.36 on the manufacturer’s website. Whether the bid won is unclear, as two auctions ran simultaneously, one for pre-qualified bidders and one for the general public, according to United Gun Group.

      World Cup security guard dies after ‘fall’ while on duty at the Lusail Stadium
    ","A Kenyan security guard who reportedly fell while on duty at Qatar’s Lusail Stadium has died in hospital, his family and officials have confirmed to CNN. His employer had notified the migrant worker’s family on Saturday that 24-year-old John Njau Kibue had fallen from the 8th floor of the stadium while on duty, his sister Ann Wanjiru said. “We don’t have the money to get justice for him, but we want to know what happened,” she told CNN. A medical certificate obtained by CNN shows he was admitted at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Hamad General Hospital in Doha. The document says Kibue had a “severe head injury, facial fractures and pelvic fractures.” In a statement, the organizers of the World Cup – the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy – announced Kibue’s death. “We regret to announce that, despite the efforts of his medical team, he sadly passed away in hospital on Tuesday 13 December, after being in the intensive care unit for three days,” the statement added. “His next of kin have been informed. We send our sincere condolences to his family, colleagues and friends during this difficult time.” Earlier this week, the committee announced that Kibue suffered a serious fall while on duty. “Qatar’s tournament organisers are investigating the circumstances leading to the fall as a matter of urgency and will provide further information pending the outcome of the investigation, ” it said in its statement. “We will also ensure that his family receive all outstanding dues and monies owed.” He had been unconscious since Saturday and was connected to a machine to help him breathe, his medical records showed. A family member was informed on Monday morning of his death. But the security guard’s family says his Qatari employer, Al Sraiya Security Services, has not explained how he fell or any of the circumstances surrounding his death. “We want justice. We want to know what caused his death. They have never sent us a picture to show where he fell from or given us any other information,” his sister Wanjiru told CNN. CNN has contacted Al Sraiya Security Services for comment after the guard’s death and is yet to receive a response. In a statement to CNN, the Kenyan embassy in Qatar said it was aware of the matter and “undertaking necessary consular assistance whilst awaiting official communication from Qatar’s Supreme Committee and competent authorities.” The guard’s family says he moved to Qatar last November for a contract with Al Sraiya Security Services. A WhatsApp message seen by CNN was sent to his colleagues at other World Cup stadiums soliciting for contributions. “He came here to support his family back home but by bad luck his dreams came to an end today,” it reads in part. “Let’s do something for our beloved comrade.” He is the second migrant worker reported dead since the tournament began in the Gulf nation after another was reportedly killed in an accident at a resort used by Saudi Arabia during the group stages.

      NC county announces curfew as nearly 40,000 customers remain without power after 2 substations damaged by gunfire
    ","Authorities have announced a mandatory curfew in a North Carolina county where around 40,000 customers lost power after two power substations were damaged by gunfire Saturday night. The county will implement a mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., starting Sunday night, Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said at a news conference Sunday. Municipality and county officials “have formed a plan for the night and the next few nights that we may be out of power. It’s a very serious situation,” Fields said. “So we’ve come to an agreement to best protect our citizens and to protect the businesses of our county, we’re going to implement a curfew tonight.” A state of emergency went into effect at 4 p.m. Sunday as law enforcement, city and energy officials are investigating the incident and working to restore the two substations, authorities said. Law enforcement has also been providing security for the stations, according to the sheriff. The power outage is being investigated as a “criminal occurrence” after crews found signs of potential vandalism at several locations, CNN previously reported. Fields said multiple rounds were fired at the two substations. “It was targeted, it wasn’t random,” he said. No suspects have been identified in connection with the incident. Fields would not say if the criminal activity was domestic terrorism. “The person, or persons, who did this knew exactly what they were doing,” Fields said. “We don’t have a clue why Moore County.” Fields acknowledged a woman who posted on Facebook Sunday morning indicating she had been questioned by law enforcement in connection with the incident. Fields did not name the woman, but said she posted false information on social media claiming to have information behind the incident. “We don’t have anything,” Fields said, when asked about a possible motive. “No motivation, no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who [did] it.” A gate at one of the locations also appears to have been taken off its hinges, Mike Cameron of the Southern Pines Fire and Rescue Department told CNN on Sunday afternoon. Cameron said the area is experiencing increased emergency calls due to the lack of power, adding that auto accidents have occurred because traffic lights are out. People who rely on oxygen have placed emergency calls, he said. More than 37,000 customers were without power across the county Sunday evening, according to the Duke Energy outage map. According to poweroutage.us, about 38,000 customers had lost power in Moore County and neighboring Hoke County. Moore County Manager Wayne Vest said a shelter, running on a generator, opened Sunday afternoon at the Moore County Sports Complex in conjunction with the Red Cross. Vest said additional trailers with bathroom and shower facilities are also being brought to the shelter. The estimated cost of the substation damage is in the “millions,” the sheriff said. Restoration to the two substations could take until Thursday for some customers, Jeff Brooks, principal communications manager for Duke Energy, said at Sunday’s news conference. “We are going to be working around the clock, all hands-on deck, to get power back as quickly and safely as possible,” Brooks said. Duke Energy will continue to work with the Moore Sheriff’s Office and county officials to support the investigation. Brooks said there had been “intentional impact” on the substation damaging multiple pieces of equipment of the substations, causing power to go out. In this instance, rerouting power is not an option, he said. “Equipment will have to be replaced,” Brooks said. “We are looking at a pretty sophisticated repair with large equipment. This will be a multiday restoration for most customers, extending possibly to Thursday.” A local supermarket is distributing ice to impacted residents, according to a news release from grocery chain Harris Teeter. The power outage has also led officials to cancel Monday classes for all schools in the county. “An announcement will be made tomorrow evening to inform parents and staff of the status of schools for Tuesday,” Moore County Schools said in a tweet Sunday afternoon. Several communities across the county began experiencing power outages just after 7 p.m. Saturday, the Moore County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. “As utility companies began responding to the different substations, evidence was discovered that indicated that intentional vandalism had occurred at multiple sites,” the office said. At least two substations were vandalized “with criminal intent,” US Rep. Richard Hudson said Sunday morning in a release. The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the FBI are responding, according to Hudson. He said the motive remains unknown. Hudson, whose congressional district includes Moore County, said the Southern Pines Police Department has opened a community center for residents to charge devices. CNN has reached out to Southern Pines police and the FBI. During the Sunday news conference, Fields addressed rumors circulating on social media that the attack was an attempt to thwart a local drag show. Fields said law enforcement is working every angle, but “have not been able to tie anything back to the drag show,” which was scheduled for Saturday night in the nearby town of Southern Pines. On its website, the Sunrise Theater advertised the “Downtown Divas!” drag show starting at 7 p.m. The power was cut shortly after that time, Fields said. CNN has reached out to the Sunrise Theater as well as the Southern Pines Police Department. CNN has also reached out to Sandhills Pride, the organization behind Saturday’s drag event. “This was a terrible act,” North Carolina State Senator Tom McInnis said during the news conference. “And it appears to be an intentional, willful and malicious act, and the perpetrator will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Crews were experiencing “multiple equipment failures” that are affecting substations in Moore County, Duke Energy spokesperson Brooks told CNN affiliate WRAL. “We are also investigating signs of potential vandalism related to the outages,” Brooks said. Deputies and officers from other law enforcement agencies responded to the different sites to provide security, according to the sheriff’s office. Gov. Roy Cooper on Sunday tweeted that state law enforcement would join the investigation. “I have spoken with Duke Energy and state law enforcement officials about the power outages in Moore County. They are investigating and working to return electricity to those impacted,” Cooper said. “The state is providing support as needed.” Moore County is in central North Carolina, about 50 miles northwest of Fayetteville.

      Sudan’s warring factions announce ceasefire, but fighting continues
    ","Both of Sudan’s warring factions have declared a 72-hour truce for the Muslim holiday of Eid after nearly a week of fierce fighting, which has left more than 400 people dead and pushed tens of thousands of refugees to flee the country. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) first announced a ceasefire earlier on Friday yet clashes continued north of the capital. Its rival Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) later announced a three-day suspension of fighting. Foreign officials and international organizations had been calling for a three-day pause in fighting, which would allow people to find food, evacuate safely, or gather with family for Eid, which marks the end of the Islamic holdy month of Ramadan. The fighting broke out last Saturday as SAF leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is Sudan’s military ruler, and RSF Commander General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo vie for control of the country But it remains unclear if the agreement will hold after several previous ceasefires between the warring generals repeatedly broke down, with both sides trading blame for violating the terms. The fighting has led to 413 deaths and 3,551 injuries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and one US citizen has also been killed amid the violence, the US State Department confirmed to CNN on Friday. Speaking at a United Nations briefing in Geneva on Friday, UNICEF spokesman James Elder said that so far at least nine children were killed and at least 50 injured, adding that the number of child casualties “will continue to rise as long as fighting continues.” Eyewitnesses that CNN has spoken with said fierce fighting raged in Khartoum North, an area north of the capital, on Friday. The violence has also hampered the work of humanitarian and aid groups. The UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that it has been forced to suspend its humanitarian operations in Sudan, after a staff member died when the vehicle he was traveling in with his family on Friday morning was caught in a crossfire between warring parties in the southern Sudanese city of El-Obeid. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says it has been unable to deliver aid to civilians in Sudan because of a lack of security guarantees due to the recent fighting and violence, according to a press release. The RSF had announced a ceasefire in a statement on Twitter on Friday morning, saying it was due to begin at 6 a.m. local time SAF leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan released an on-camera statement Friday morning, expressing sadness for victims of the fighting and praying for a peaceful Eid – but he made no mention of a truce. “The ruin and destruction and the sound of gunfire have not allowed a space for the joy that our people across our beloved country deserve, and we are deeply saddened by this,” Burhan said in the statement – his first on-camera remarks since clashes broke out on April 15. The pleas for a truce have grown more urgent in recent days as the death toll climbs. Most hospitals in the capital Khartoum are out of operation, with many having come under attack by shelling; meanwhile, those still operating are rapidly running out of supplies to treat survivors. Residents have been stranded at home and in shelters without food or water, surrounded by the threat of gunfire and artillery outside. The fighting could force millions into hunger, the World Food Program (WFP) warned on Thursday. “Record numbers of people were already facing hunger in Sudan before the conflict erupted on April 15,” it said in a statement, adding that the fighting was preventing the organization from delivering emergency food to civilians. The death of a US citizen in Sudan was confirmed by a State Department spokesperson on Friday. “We are in touch with the family and offer our deepest condolences to them on their loss,” the spokesperson told CNN. “Out of respect for the family during this difficult time, we have nothing further to add,” they added. A ceasefire could provide a crucial window not just for aid distribution and medical care – but for foreign governments to reach their citizens stranded in the country. There are an estimated 16,000 American citizens in Sudan, most of whom are dual nationals, officials told staffers Wednesday. Roughly 500 had contacted the US Embassy since the outbreak of fighting, though only around 50 of those people had asked for help, according to the staffers. But the security situation and the closure of the airport in Khartoum has led to the US State Department to advise that American citizens in Sudan “should have no expectation of a US government-coordinated evacuation at this time,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel at a press briefing. “It is imperative that US citizens in Sudan make their own arrangements to stay safe in these difficult circumstances,” he added. The US Defense Department said on Thursday it was deploying “additional capabilities” nearby Sudan to secure the US Embassy in the country and assist with a potential evacuation, if the situation calls for it. It includes hundreds of Marines who are already in nearby Djibouti, a US defense official told CNN, with aircraft capable of bringing in ground units to secure an embassy. US President Joe Biden had “authorized the military to move forward with pre-positioning forces and to develop options in case – and I want to stress right now – in case there’s a need for an evacuation,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. Some countries have already begun the evacuation process, with Japan announcing it would send its Self-Defense Forces to evacuate 60 Japanese nationals, including embassy staff, from Sudan. South Korea’s defense ministry said Friday it would send a military transport plane to evacuate its nationals from Sudan, adding that the aircraft and troops will “watch the situation from the US military base in Djibouti” since the Khartoum international airport remains closed. It added that all 26 South Koreans in Sudan have been confirmed to be safe, and that their forces would “prioritize the evacuation.” Sudan’s army said Thursday that 177 Egyptian soldiers who had been trapped in the country were evacuated and safely returned to Egypt. However, not all evacuations have started. Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Friday that Spain has “pre-positioned” military planes to evacuate 60 Spaniards and about 20 nationals from other countries from violence-torn Sudan, but conditions are currently not safe for the planes to land in the country. Albares did not say where the planes were pre-positioned, but prominent Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that the site is in Djibouti in East Africa. The newspaper said each plane has a capacity to evacuate about 100 people from Sudan. Spain’s Defense Ministry press office declined to respond to CNN’s questions about the number of planes sent and their location. Meanwhile, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson acknowledged that his country has not been able so far to take part in an international evacuation mission of both Swedes and other foreign citizens who are in Sudan, his press office said Friday in a statement. On Wednesday, “the government made the necessary decisions needed for Sweden to be able to assist in an international evacuation mission of both Swedes and other foreign citizens who are in Sudan. Right now, it not possible to carry out that mission. We hope that it will be possible very soon,” Kristersson said. Switzerland said on Friday it was weighing evacuations of Swiss nationals and a portion of its embassy staff. The Swiss foreign affairs department said there were believed to be some 100 Swiss nationals registered in Sudan, while others were thought to be visiting the Red Sea area as tourists. Local residents, too, are fleeing the country in huge numbers. Eyewitnesses in Khartoum describe growing lines of people at bus stops, hoping to escape the fighting. And up to 20,000 refugees from Sudan’s Darfur region have fled to neighboring Chad in recent days, according to a statement from the UN Refugee Agency.

      10 members of same family killed in South Africa mass shooting
    ","Ten members from the same family, including seven women and three men, were killed by gunmen Friday in the city of Pietermaritzburg, in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province of South Africa, police said Friday. “According to initial police reports, unknown gunmen stormed a Pietermaritzburg homestead and ambushed the family,” the South African Ministry of Police said in a statement Friday. In an updated statement, the police ministry said a 13-year-old boy was among those killed by the gunmen. The mayor of the area told local media that they needed to bolster capacity of local police stations. National police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe told CNN some arrests have been made. “Two suspects (have been) arrested, one dead, another fled the scene. Police are on a manhunt,” she said, adding that three firearms were recovered from the suspects during a shootout. South Africa has been rocked by several mass shootings in recent months – some, say police, are related to taxi business violence while others appear to be linked to drug cartels. There has been no motive yet suggested for Friday’s shooting. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, according to police statistics. The rates have been increasing sharply after the temporary lull during the most severe period of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. At least 15 people died after a shooting at a bar in the township of Soweto last July. Four other people were killed in a separate shooting incident in a bar in Pietermaritzburg on the same evening. The country’s Police Minister, Bheki Cele, is visiting the crime scene of the recent shooting Friday with the top management team of the South African Police Service (SAPS) led by National Commissioner, Fannie Masemola, the statement said.

      Uganda’s President Museveni to return anti-LGBTQ+ bill to parliament
    ","Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni does not oppose a controversial anti-LGBTQ+ bill and plans to finalize it next week, Uganda’s ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), said on Thursday. “President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has congratulated the members of parliament for their stand on homosexuality and agreed to assent to the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, 2023 into law,” said NRM in a press release published on its website. However, Museveni has not yet signed the bill into law and earlier today following a meeting of the NRM, he decided to send it back to the parliament for amendments. The Anti Homosexuality Bill 2023 would criminalize even identifying as LGBTQ+ and also suggests the death penalty for so-called “aggravated homosexuality.” Scientists and academics this week signed an open letter urging Museveni to veto the bill, which has received widespread condemnation from around the world, including from the United Nations, the European Union, and the United States’ Secretary of State. NRM chief whip Denis Hamson Obua said on Thursday that the anti-LGBTQ+ bill has “in principle” been supported unanimously by the NRM parliamentary caucus, and that “all the punishment contained therein in regards to promotion of homosexuality, to recruitment of homosexuals, to publicizing homosexuality is upheld.” According to the NRM press release, Museveni has proposed the bill be amended to offer amnesty “for those who will have come out to be helped not to punish them.” “Since we have agreed now, I’m going to return that bill, and you quickly deal with those issues and we sign it,” Museveni said according to the NRM’s press release. Museveni is expected to meet the legal affairs committee of parliament and other parties next week to finalize the bill. It is already currently illegal to engage in same-sex relations in Uganda under section 145 of the country’s penal code. Same-sex conduct has been deemed “against to the order of nature” in the country and warrants a life sentence in prison. The bill was passed almost unanimously by lawmakers in Ugandan parliament last month. ",335,africa,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/africa/museveni-uganda-lgbtw-intl/index.html

      ‘We saw corpses in the street:’ People flee Sudan’s capital as violence torments city
    ","Sudanese people and Western staff are desperately trying to flee the country’s capital, Khartoum, where intense violence between rival factions is overwhelming hospitals with victims and multiple attempts to bring about a ceasefire have failed. Bloody clashes and confrontations between the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have entered a sixth day, bringing chaos to the streets of Khartoum and other towns and cities near the capital. By Thursday morning, many residents trapped in the middle of the clashes appeared to have lost faith in an immediate resolution. There was an increase in the number of people at bus stops, trying to leave Khartoum and escape the fighting, according to witnesses. “Yesterday (Wednesday), I decided to leave Khartoum together with my wife and four of my children at any cost,” Muhammad Hammam told CNN in an interview, as he recalled his success in escaping from the Al-Nasr neighborhood, east of the Nile, to the city of Atbara, northern Sudan. “Death surrounded us from all directions, so I said it would be better for us to die attempting to cling to life while trying to survive instead of dying by a stray bullet at home or maybe dying of hunger or thirst,” he said. Up to 20,000 refugees from Sudan’s Darfur region have fled to Chad in recent days, according to a statement from the UN Refugee Agency. But escaping is no simple task. The capital’s international airport remains out of service, according to a source in a Sudanese army, who claims the airport’s control towers were destroyed by RSF bombings. CNN is reaching out to the RSF for comment. The ongoing fighting and closed airport have hampered efforts to evacuate US diplomatic staff. A senior US official told CNN Thursday that an evacuation was not imminent as the situation on the ground remained too volatile. Americans in the country have been urged to shelter in place. The US Defense Department said it was deploying “additional capabilities” nearby Sudan to secure the US embassy in the country and assist with a potential evacuation, if the situation calls for it. It includes hundreds of marines who are already in Djibouti, a US defense official told CNN, with aircraft capable of bringing in ground units to secure an embassy. US President Joe Biden had “authorized the military to move forward with pre-positioning forces and to develop options in case – and I want to stress right now – in case there’s a need for an evacuation,” National Security Council spokesman  John Kirby said Thursday. Hammam said the attempt to flee was interrupted by a street war that broke out in his neighborhood by the warring factions. “My wife, children and I remained lying on the ground until yesterday morning,” he said. Bus tickets out of the conflict zone were around five times more expensive than before violence broke out, he told CNN. “Praise be to God, we escaped death. However, my children live in real terror. They will never forget the sound of ammunition and exchange,” he said. The RSF and Sudan’s armed forces have been battling for power for since Saturday, and numerous attempts to pause the violence have proven futile despite expressions of support from each side. Eyewitnesses said Thursday that reinforcements for the paramilitary RSF were on their way to Khartoum when army forces confronted them with warplanes and ground forces. The UN has called for a ceasefire for at least three days after recent fighting to mark Eid celebrations, Secretary General  António Guterres said during a press conference on Thursday. “As an immediate priority, I appeal for a ceasefire to take place for at least three days marking the Eid al Fitr celebrations to allow civilians trapped in conflict zones to escape and to seek medical treatment, food and other essential supplies,” Guterres said. But Sudan’s army leader Abdel Fattah Al Burhan told Al Jazeera that RSF troops need to withdraw from the cities if there is to be any truce, which the RSF pushed back against, saying they “will not withdraw or give up their right” to defend themselves, in a statement to CNN. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the death toll in Sudan as of Thursday has risen to 331, with another 3180 injured, according to spokesman Tarik Jašarević in a statement to CNN. A water and electricity crisis has continued in Khartoum, with food shortages in shops and pharmacies closed, eyewitnesses say. Fuel is also in short supply with gas stations shut since Saturday. Intisar Muhammad Khair told CNN that she and her daughters were stranded for four days in her three-storey house in the center of Khartoum, until they managed to escape during Wednesday’s truce. “(This was) after I lost hope of survival and began prayers and supplications that we die in decent fashion, especially when our stocks of food and water had run out,” she said. “The most dangerous thing that frightened us was the presence of an armored vehicle of the RSF under our house,” she said, adding that she “saw corpses dumped in the streets and military vehicles burned” as they made their escape. With gas stations closed, those with fuel in their vehicles have had greater opportunities to flee the danger. “So many people can’t drive out because they don’t have petrol but for us, thank God, we took the car that has petrol,” Hadeel Mohamed, a 28-year-old architect, told CNN after leaving the city. “We packed our bags and the few necessities and that and we left. We went inside the neighborhood we did not take the main streets,” she said. “There are very few people now, the whole neighborhood left. Everyone with a family has left.” She said many in the city have felt unprotected by the armed forces as they engage in combat with the RSF. “The army started a war in a city where citizens are, and didn’t release a statement prior to the citizens saying ‘you need to be aware some clashes will happen,’” she said. “That kind of left us saying: ‘who are you and who are you fighting for really?” At least nine children have reportedly been killed and more than 50 injured amid the ongoing fighting in Sudan, according to a statement from UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell on Thursday. “We have received reports of children sheltering in schools and care centers while fighting rages around them, of children’s hospitals forced to evacuate as shelling moves closer, and hospitals, health centres and other critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed, limiting access to essential and lifesaving care and medicine,” Russell said. Sudan’s Doctor’s Union has meanwhile said that 52 hospitals are out of service in the capital and adjacent areas, equating to about 70% of hospitals in the region. Nine hospitals were bombed, and 19 were subject to forced evacuation, according to the union. The union also said that five ambulances had been attacked by military forces, and others were prevented from transporting patients for treatment and delivering aid. Attiyah Abdullah, general secretary of the Preliminary Committee of Sudan’s Doctors Union, said in an interview that there are “very few hospitals still in operation, and those that are, are on the edge of collapse.” As facilities run low on supplies, the violence is blocking aid from being delivered to hospitals, Save the Children Sudan country director Arshad Malik told CNN on Thursday. Malik said that while the hospitals were without blood bags used in transfusions and short on diesel to power generators, Save The Children is relatively well stocked in the city but transport and access were the problems. “We have the supplies, and we have the emergency support staff. They are ready, but they are stuck at home for now. We will see if they can move and give the supplies to different hospitals,” he said. “Children are seeing bullets and mortars hitting their houses,” Malik added. “There is constant fighting and shelling around them.” RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, is vying for power against Sudan’s military chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, with forces loyal to each man battling violently for control. Hemedti is commanding his troops from the city’s Hai Al Matar neighborhood, which is close to the military headquarters, a high-ranking military official and an eyewitness told CNN on Wednesday. The military official chose to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak. The eyewitness, who saw Hemedti’s convoy, requested anonymity out of fear for their safety. A latest attempt to strike a ceasefire for 24 hours was quickly upended late on Wednesday, when clashes erupted north of Khartoum. Each faction previously accused the other of breaking another failed truce on Tuesday.

      Clashes re-erupt in Sudan, hours after truce went into effect
    ","Clashes erupted north of Sudan’s capital Khartoum on Wednesday night, upending a temporary ceasefire between the Sudanese Army and its rival, the Rapid Support Force, just hours after it was struck. The two factions have been battling for days, and Wednesday saw fierce fighting in central Khartoum as well as serious clashes at the capital’s main airport, which has been closed since Saturday as RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, vies for power against Sudan’s military chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. Hemedti is commanding his troops from the city’s Hai Al Matar neighborhood, which is close to the military headquarters, a high ranking military official and an eyewitness told CNN. The military official chose to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak. The eyewitness, who saw Hemedti’s convoy, requested anonymity out of fear for their safety. The Sudanese armed forces said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that it “repelled and defeated” RSF’s attempt to seize the army’s headquarters, saying they have seized “quantities of ammunition, a number of medium and light machine guns, personal weapons, and 24 Land Cruisers that they [RSF] left behind.” It admitted that since the outbreak of fighting on Saturday, RSF has managed to seize a number of government headquarters including the Ministry of the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of the Interior and the Civil Registry Department and are using these “civilian institutions to manage their combat activities.” The army said that RSF seized a number of “weapons stores from police stations.” The failed ceasefire had been hoped to provide respite for civilians caught in the middle of the conflict. Each faction previously accused the other of breaking another failed truce on Tuesday, with clashes re-erupting in the capital. Sudan’s armed forces accused RSF of assaulting civilians, looting and “burning the market on Bahri in Khartoum,” said Sudanese Armed Forces spokesperson Brigadier General Nabil Abdallah Ali Moussa. “The real problem is that there does not seem that there is control over the RSF from its leadership. They are acting similar to gangs, and they are threatening people’s lives,” Moussa said. The RSF accused the armed forces of breaching the truce “in the first hours” after it came into effect, and said the army continues to engage in “heavy weapons attacks and indiscriminate bombing.” Civilians remain been caught in the chaos, and internet outages have been reported in the country by Internet watchdog NetBlocks. “The situation today is worse than yesterday,” Amal, a Sudanese woman who has been trapped in her home, told CNN. “We can hear heavy artillery and smell and see the smoke rising from burning buildings,” she said. Eman, a British-Sudanese doctor visiting Khartoum who has been trapped in her home since Saturday, told CNN that a number of her friends and family members have had to evacuate their homes, seeking shelter from indiscriminate bombing which has hit some residential buildings. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called for immediate humanitarian access in a statement Wednesday. “Fierce clashes continued overnight in the capital Khartoum with reports of rising numbers of civilian casualties. Hospitals in the capital are running dangerously low on medical supplies, while damage to the water and energy infrastructure has also left medical facilities without power and clean water,” the ICRC said. Patrick Youssef, Africa regional director for the ICRC, called for “unimpeded” access. “It is highly distressing hearing reports of civilian casualties and bodies left lying in the streets of Khartoum,” he said. “They need to be collected and treated with dignity.” Half of the hospitals in Sudan’s capital are “out of action” due to intensifying clashes, according to a leading aid organization – even as the number of casualties rise and many of the injured are in dire need of medical attention. “According to the information we have in Khartoum, 50% of hospitals have been out of action in the first 72 hours,” said Abdalla Hussein, the Médecins Sans Frontière (MSF) operational manager for Sudan. “This is because the staff weren’t feeling safe to go there or the hospitals themselves have been subject to shelling or bombing,” he said. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 296 people have been killed and more than 3,000 have been injured since fighting erupted on Saturday. International governments have been calling for a truce so authorities can distribute aid and coordinate evacuations. On Wednesday, Japan said it was preparing to send its military to evacuate nationals from Sudan. Japan has been able to contact all 60 of its nationals in Sudan, including embassy staff, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said during an emergency news conference. There are no reports of injuries among them, though food and water are scarce, and power cuts have become frequent as the security situation deteriorates. The United States has not announced any plans for an evacuation operation for Americans in Sudan, but has urged its nationals to stay indoors, shelter in place, and stay away from windows. Other countries have published advisories to their nationals in Sudan. China has asked its citizens there to stay vigilant and to register their information online with the Chinese Embassy in Khartoum. The Indian Embassy in Sudan also issued an advisory on Tuesday asking its citizens to stay indoors and ration supplies due to looting. The advisories come as reports emerge of attacks on foreign nationals and staffers. Armed personnel stormed the homes of people working for the UN and other international organizations in downtown Khartoum, according to reports in an internal UN document seen by CNN. According to the document, the gunmen sexually assaulted women and stole belongings including cars. One incident of rape was also reported. These armed personnel, “reportedly from RSF, are entering the residences of expats, separating men and women and taking them away,” read the report. CNN has not been able to independently verify the alleged attacks. The RSF denied the claims, blaming Sudan’s armed forces for committing the crimes while wearing RSF uniforms. The armed forces have denied involvement in the violations, and reiterated accusations that the RSF has committed crimes against humanity. In separate incidents cited in the document, two Nigerian men working for an international organization were abducted and later released; a building housing the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs was targeted; and a rocket-propelled grenade hit the home of a local UN staff member in Khartoum. On Wednesday, medical charity MSF said its compound in Nyala, South Darfur, had been raided by armed men who “stole everything including vehicles and office equipment.” “Our warehouse – holding vital medical supplies – was also raided, we do not know to what extent as we have no access,” MSF said on its official Twitter account. “We request again respect for the protection of humanitarian organisations and their premises. Our priority now is to ensure the safety of our staff,” the post added. Other incidents in recent days include a US diplomatic convoy coming under gunfire, the EU ambassador to Sudan being assaulted in his Khartoum residency, and three workers from the UN’s World Food Programme killed in clashes.

      Global scientists urge Uganda’s president to veto anti-LGBTQ bill
    ","A group of leading global scientists and academics have signed an open letter urging Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to veto a hardline bill criminalizing homosexuality in the country. The bill outlaws identifying as LGBTQ+, and suggests life sentences for convicted homosexuals as well as the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality,” a sweeping term covering various sexual acts including sex with people with mental or physical disabilities or sex with children. The Anti Homosexuality Bill 2023, which was passed by Ugandan lawmakers in March, is set to be either signed into law or vetoed by the president on Thursday. Before the bill was passed almost unanimously last month, President Museveni called on scientists to establish whether homosexuality was natural or learned. Museveni has previously called homosexuals “deviations from normal.” In their open letter, the group of scientists state: “We cannot say this enough: homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality. The science on this subject is crystal clear and we call on you [Museveni] in the strongest possible terms to veto the bill in the name of science. “We cannot think of one major scientific organization – from the World Health Organization to the World Health Assembly and beyond – which would argue against the idea homosexuality is not normal and natural,” the letter continues. The letter has been signed by 15 leading scientists around the world, from countries including South Africa, the United States, Canada, the UK, Kenya, and Australia. The scientists write that genetics play a role in homosexuality, and that the practice cannot be caught like a “common cold.” Nor can homosexuality be indoctrinated, they say: “Exposure to rainbow flags will not make a child gay.” “Sexual orientation is not limited to any specific region. It is not confined by borders drawn on a map. It needs no passport to travel. Indeed, there’s clear evidence for same sex relationships in Africa dating back hundreds of years,” the letter adds. Ugandan authorities did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Same-sex relations are already illegal in Uganda and warrant a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Under the Anti Homosexuality Bill 2023, it would be a crime to even identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. Those identifying as LGBTQ+ would face up to 20 years in jail. Alongside the letter, Professor Glenda Gray, President and CEO of the South African Medical Research Council said: “Despite the rhetoric, homosexuality is not a pernicious western import. If anything, it´s state-sponsored homophobia that´s un-African and against the principles of Ubuntu, not homosexuality.” Dean Hamer, Scientist Emeritus at the US National Institutes of Health, stated: “Homosexuality, like heterosexuality, is a natural variation of the human condition, deeply ingrained and observed in every society and culture worldwide across history.  Attempts to eradicate same-sex desire will not only fail, but will reflect poorly on your reputation and the standing of your nation.” Andrew Legon, Senior Campaigner at Avaaz, added: “President Museveni said he wanted a scientific opinion before making a decision on the anti-homosexuality bill, and now he has it. It’s time for the President to shelve this bill for good - not only because it’s unscientific, but because it’s completely counter to the universal human rights embodied in the Ugandan constitution.” ",542,africa,2023-04-19,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/africa/uganda-anti-lgbtq-bill-scientists-open-letter-intl/index.html

      Seven-fold increase in children crossing treacherous Darien Gap, says UNICEF
    ","Almost 9,700 children and adolescents have tried to cross the infamous Darien Gap in the first two months of 2023, a seven-fold increase compared to the same period in 2022, according to a UNICEF report. The 60 kilometer (37 mile) trek north brings migrants from Colombia to Panama – a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. The UN children’s agency said that 110 of the children had attempted the dangerous hike alone. It noted that large numbers of the people on that route in the same time period were from Haiti, Ecuador and Venezuela. Travelers trying to make it through have reported robberies, corpses, mutilations and rape in the dense forest along the route. For children who survive the trek, UNICEF has warned of  “invisible wounds.” “Many of these kids have gone through a terrible time, they have seen things they should not have seen,” Sandie Blanchet, UNICEF’s representative in Panama, told CNN in 2021. This week, the United States, Panama and Colombia announced a 60-day campaign to curb illegal migration through the Darien Gap, laying out plans to reduce illicit movement and opening new legal migration pathways. “Every year, tens of thousands of migrants attempt to cross the border between Panamá and Colombia, putting their lives in the hands of smugglers, with many perishing while attempting to pass through the treacherous terrain,” officials from the three countries said in a joint statement. The statement also acknowledged all three countries have a responsibility to prevent the risk to human life, disrupt transnational criminal organizations and preserve the rainforest.

      They were held in pretrial detention in Mexico for 17 years. A court says Mexico must make amends
    ","A human rights court has ruled that Mexico violated the rights of two people who were held in pretrial detention for more than 17 years. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights said on Wednesday that the Mexican government is responsible for “the violation of the rights to personal integrity, personal liberty, to judicial guarantees, to equality before the law and to judicial protection.” It also found that the two detainees, Daniel García Rodríguez and Reyes Alpízar Ortiz, were subjected to torture during the period in which they were held. García and Alpízar were arrested in 2002 and remained in pretrial detention for 17 years before they were sentenced on homicide charges. They were accused of murdering a municipal councilor in 2001 and filed a complaint before the Inter-American Court in 2007. On March 19, after their latest appeal, a Mexican court notified Alpízar of his acquittal but upheld García’s 35-year sentence, which he considered “unfair and without evidence,” according to El Universal newspaper. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has ordered Mexico to make amends with a series of reparation measures, including payments for material and immaterial damages. The Mexican government was also asked to adapt judicial procedures to international standards. The court gave Mexico one year to comply with the ruling. The Mexican government said it “will analyze the resolution of the court in order to comply with its provisions and ensure the greatest respect for the obligations contained in the American Convention on Human Rights.” It also said that this sentence will serve to guide the actions of the state regarding the protection of the rights of people deprived of their liberty and who are facing trial.

      Nicaragua expels two nuns in latest crackdown on Catholic church and opposition
    ","Two nuns who worked at a nursing home in Nicaragua were expelled from the country this week, amid a far-reaching crackdown on opposition leaders, journalists and the Catholic church by the government of President Daniel Ortega. The strongman president has taken aim at the clergy in his country, calling bishops of the Nicaraguan Episcopal Conference (CEN) “terrorists.” Ortega accuses the Catholic church of supporting anti-government protests in 2018, which his government labeled an “attempted coup.” The nuns, both Costa Rican citizens, arrived in Costa Rica on Wednesday, according to the Diocese of Tilarán-Liberia. Sisters Isabel and Cecilia Blanco Cubillo, from the congregation Dominicas de la Anunciata, managed a nursing home in Nicaragua, according to Bishop Manuel Eugenio Salazar Mora. Salazar Mora urged supporters to pray for the church, and for a Nicaraguan bishop named Rolando Álvarez, who was imprisoned in February. The Nicaraguan justice system sentenced Álvarez, a vocal government critic, to more than 26 years in prison for crimes such as undermining the state and Nicaraguan society, and for allegedly spreading false news. Lacking a defense, the bishop was unable to refute the accusations. On Wednesday, a group of Trappist nuns from Nicaragua, who left the country at the end of February, also said that the government had confiscated their monastery, and handed it over to the Nicaraguan Institute of Agricultural Technology. CNN is seeking a response from the government about both cases. The authoritarian Ortega and his government have unleashed a campaign of political terror on the country. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled their homeland to avoid persecution since 2018, when Ortega’s government cracked down on widespread anti-regime protests, killing hundreds of people, injuring thousands and arbitrarily detaining many, according to Human Rights Watch. Protesters and their families at the time sometimes sought refuge from attacks by pro-government forces inside the country’s churches and cathedrals. Bishops of the Episcopal Conference also participated as mediators for national dialogue, convening different social sectors with the government in an attempt to seek a peaceful solution to the political conflict. Ortega claimed a fifth term as president in 2021. In June of that year, his government began using a vague national security law as justification to lock up opposition presidential candidates, opposition leaders, journalists, human rights activists and others ahead of the November election. In February, the Nicaraguan government released more than 200 political prisoners, many of whom arrived in the United States.

      Mexico investigates migration chief over deadly fire in detention center
    ","Mexican authorities are investigating the head of the country’s immigration agency, in the wake of last month’s deadly fire in a migrant detention center that killed at least 38 people and left dozens injured. Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador confirmed on Wednesday that the Attorney General’s Office is probing Francisco Garduño, commissioner of the National Institute of Migration (INM) in Ciudad Juárez, for the tragedy. In his morning press conference, Lopez Obrador said that he did not know the scope of the investigation or the specific accusations against Garduño. “There are several involved and this morning there was discussion that some may be accused of negligence, others of homicide. There is still a need for the Prosecutor’s Office to report more on the investigation and for the judges to be in charge of delivering justice,” the Mexican president said. “From the beginning we maintained that there would be no impunity for anyone,” he added. CNN is seeking comment from Garduño and his representatives. Mexico’s Attorney General earlier announced that criminal proceedings had begun involving the INM chief and another official identified only as Antonio “N.” Both men are accused of engaging in “alleged criminal conduct, by failing to comply with their obligations to monitor, protect and provide security to people and facilities under their charge, facilitating crimes committed against migrants.” The statement noted that a similar incident had occurred on March 31, 2020 in Tabasco, where one person died and 14 others were injured, raising concerns of a potential “pattern of conduct in which the security measures that were essential and mandatory in these cases have been omitted by those responsible.” Four other public servants are also being prosecuted and investigations are still ongoing, the statement concluded. As CNN previously reported, the deadly March blaze at the INM facility started shortly after 10 p.m. inside an accommodation area, according to the agency. Authorities said it broke out after they picked up and detained a group of migrants from the streets of the border city, which sits across from El Paso, Texas. Sixty-eight men from Central and South America were being held at the facility, the INM said in a statement, including citizens of Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras and Venezuela. Surveillance video from inside the center obtained by CNN appeared to show that those detained were behind bars with the gate locked at the time of the fire. An eyewitness to the blaze, a Venezuelan woman whose husband was trapped inside the building and injured in the fire, spoke to Reuters news agency. Fighting back tears, she blamed Mexican authorities and claimed the doors to the detention center were not opened. “At 10 p.m., we started to see smoke billowing from everywhere, everybody ran away but they left the men locked in. Everybody was removed from the area, but they left the men locked in. They never opened the door,” 31-year-old Viangly Infante, a Venezuelan national, told the agency. The INM said at the time that it strongly rejected “the acts that led to this tragedy,” and opened an investigation into the incident.

      Meet pocket-sized Pearl, the world’s shortest dog
    ","Pearl is no ordinary handbag dog. She’s so tiny, her owner can just slip her into her pocket. The two-year-old chihuahua, who measures around the same length as a dollar bill, has been named the world’s shortest dog by Guinness World Records. Born in Florida on September 1 2020, Pearl is shorter than a Popsicle stick at just 3.59 inches tall. She is 5 inches long – around the same as a dollar bill – and weighs a tiny 1.22 pounds, a huge gain on the less than one ounce that she weighed at birth. Pearl is related to previous record holder Miracle Milly, who measured 3.8 inches tall. She died in 2020, before Pearl was born. Pearl’s mother is one of Milly’s identical sisters, according to Guinness World Records. Her owner Vanesa Semler, who was also the owner of Miracle Milly, told Guinness World Records: “We’re blessed to have her. And to have this unique opportunity to break our own record and share with the world this amazing news.” Pearl was recently unveiled on “Lo Show Dei Record,” Guinness’ TV talent show in Italy. Appearing alongside her at the studio in Milan, Semler said Pearl was “a bit of a diva,” though she seemed calm and unfazed in front of the live studio audience. Semler is the owner of three other dogs, all of whom are of “normal” size, she said. Describing her pet as “small like a ball” and slightly taller than a teacup, Semler said Pearl is accustomed to a high quality diet of chicken and salmon. She also loves “dressing up nice,” according to Semler. “We have lots of fun together,” she said, adding that her adult dog is still a “child at heart.” Pearl’s record was confirmed after she was measured at the Crystal Creek Animal Hospital in Orlando, Florida, where she was born. According to Guinness’ official guidelines, each measurement was taken from the base of the front leg foot up to the top of the ridge between her shoulder blades in a straight vertical line. The smallest ever dog, a dwarf Yorkshire terrier, stood at just 2.8 inches tall and measured just 3.75 inches long, from the tip of its nose to the end of its tail. Owned by UK-based Arthur Marples, the tiny terrier died in 1945, before its second birthday.

      Relocating 70 of Pablo Escobar’s ‘cocaine hippos’ to cost around $3.5 million
    ","Colombia’s plans to relocate 70 “cocaine hippos” descended from drug trafficker Pablo Escobar’s private menagerie will cost approximately $3.5 million, officials said in a press conference Wednesday. It will form part of a deal that the local Antioquia government signed with various institutions including the Colombian Agricultural Institute, the Colombian Air Force and the Ostok Sanctuary in Mexico where 10 hippos will be transported, a statement released on Wednesday said. A sanctuary in India will provide a new home for the other 60 hippos since it is impossible to transport them back to their native Africa and risks upsetting the local ecosystem there. The deal will allocate resources to build boxes and cover air transport costs for the hippos, whose population has boomed despite the efforts of authorities to control it using castrations and “shots” of contraceptive darts. There are now between 130 and 160 of the hippos, according to the Colombian government, and they have spread out far beyond Escobar’s former ranch of Hacienda Napoles, where they began as a population of just one male and three females. The original hippos were part of a collection of exotic animals Escobar had amassed in the 1980s at his ranch about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Medellín. After his death in 1993, authorities relocated most of the other animals, but not the hippos – because they were too difficult to transport. But they have since begun to reproduce rapidly, free from any natural predator, extending their reach along the Magdalena River basin, and they now pose an environmental challenge and are concerning nearby residents, authorities say. “We’re looking to save the lives of hippos, but also to protect the lives of people in the Magdalena Medio region,” Anibal Gaviria, governor of Antioquia Department, said in a press conference on Wednesday. Recently declared an invasive species in Colombia, the hippos’ threat to agriculture and people’s safety has been well documented in research, as has the impact of hippo waste on oxygen levels in bodies of water, which can reduce water quality and cause mass fish deaths. Once the Ministry of Environment issues “hippo passports,” the transport process can happen and it is expected to take place by the end of the first semester of the year, the statement read.

      Large swathes of Asia are sweltering through record breaking temperatures
    ","Temperature records are being shattered in countries across Asia as a brutal April heat wave continues to grip large portions of the continent, with little relief in sight. In Southeast Asia, some countries posted their highest ever recorded temperatures this week, while searing heat in the Indian subcontinent has killed more than a dozen people. Laos is the latest country to set a new all-time record as Luang Prabang reached 42.7°C (109°F) Tuesday, according to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera. Over the weekend, Thailand topped 45°C (113°F) for the first time in its history, according to Herrera, using data from the Thai Meteorological Department. The northwest city of Tak reached 45.4°C Saturday, but large portions of the country have been in the upper 30s to low 40s since late March. Earlier this month, Thai authorities issued a health alert for several provinces as the heat index was forecast to reach 50.2°C in the Bang Na district of the capital Bangkok. The heat index is what the temperature “feels like” and considers both air temperature and humidity to measure its impact. On Tuesday, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern over “dangerously high temperatures in various parts of Thailand” and said in Bangkok’s Bang Na area, temperatures “could reach 52.3°C,” according to a statement from the prime ministers office. Neighboring Myanmar set an April temperature record on Monday as Kalewa, in central Sagaing region, reached 44°C (111°F), Herrera tweeted. April and May are typically the hottest months of the year for South and Southeast Asia as temperatures rise before monsoon rains begin and bring some relief. But the heat in Thailand has been compounded by an intense smoggy season that has caused pollution levels to spike. The tourist hotspot of Chiang Mai in the north ranked as the world’s most polluted city for seven straight days as smoke from forest fires and widespread crop burning deteriorated the air quality. At least one hospital in the city said it had reached “full ward capacity” as patients sought medical treatment for respiratory issues. The scorching temperatures have also been widespread across China. On Tuesday, the country saw temperatures as high as 42.4°C (108°F) in Yuanyang, in the southeast – only 0.3°C from the country-wide record for April, according to Herrera. On Monday, more than 100 weather stations in 12 provinces broke their April temperature record, according to climatologist Jim Yang. Although not record-breaking in most cases, the heat has also been prevalent – and deadly – across South Asia. Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh have all seen temperatures topping 40°C (104°F) for many days. According to India’s Meteorological Department, 48 weather stations recorded temperatures over 42°C on Tuesday, with the highest at 44.2°C in the eastern state of Odisha. In western Maharashtra state, at least 13 people died from heatstroke after attending a state award ceremony on Sunday. More than 1 million people attended the event in Navi Mumbai and between 50 to 60 people were hospitalized, according to a city police official. Meanwhile, at least two states, Tripura in the northeast and West Bengal in the east, ordered schools to shut this week, as temperatures rose more than 5 degrees Celsius above normal, state governments said, Reuters reported. The Indian Ministry of Labor issued an advisory to all states and regions to ensure the safety of workers – especially outdoor laborers and miners – in the extreme heat. That includes providing adequate drinking water, emergency ice packs, and frequent rest breaks. Heat waves in India usually take place between March and July, but in recent years these hot spells have become more intense, more frequent and longer. Last year, India experienced a searing heatwave, where parts of the country reached more than 49°C (120°F). As the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis accelerate and global temperatures continue to rise, scientists say heat waves will only become more common. A 2022 study found that dangerous heat waves will be between three and 10 times more often by the turn of the century. In the tropics, which encompasses much of Asia, people could be exposed to dangerous heat most days of the year, the study found. Days of “extremely dangerous heat” – which is defined as 51°C (124°F) – could double and experts say those levels of heat push the limits of human survivability. Extremely hot temperatures across South and Southeast Asia are expected to continue. Meanwhile, cooler conditions are on the way for much of China as temperatures are forecast to fall from around 10°C (18°F) above average to 10°C (18° F) below average this weekend.

      Hospital fire in Beijing kills at least 21 people
    ","At least 21 people have died in a fire that tore through a hospital in China’s capital Beijing, state media CCTV reported on Tuesday. Amateur video shows people hanging from the façade of the building while attempting to escape the blaze which started around 1 p.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) in what Chinese state media described as the inpatient department of Changfeng Hospital. “As of 6pm local (6am EST), 21 people have unfortunately died,” CCTV said. Additionally, 71 patients were evacuated. The blaze is one of the most deadly in Beijing in recent years, surpassing the toll from a fire in 2017 that killed 19 in a cramped two-story building in Daxing district in the capital’s southern suburb. That tragedy prompted authorities to demolish large swathes of buildings deemed illegal or unsafe in the neighborhood and forced thousands of migrant workers out of their homes and businesses. In videos shared on social media Tuesday, smoke can be seen billowing out of several hospital windows as people attempt to escape the blaze. At least one person appears to use a rope made from bedsheets to descend from a window to a lower level terrace. Others people are seen either sitting on air conditioning units positioned on the exterior of the building, or trying to use the units to maneuver from one level to the next. One person is seen jumping from one level of the building to the lower terrace. It is unclear if all those seen outside the building escaped the fire or not. At least two ladders are seen leaning against the building amid rescue efforts. Several other clips that showed the exterior of the building and were posted on Weibo have since been removed.

      China has ramped up construction on its new Antarctic station, new report reveals
    ","China is making “significant progress” building the country’s fifth research facility in Antarctica after a several years-long lull in construction, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). New support facilities and groundwork for a larger structure have appeared at the site following several years of dormancy after construction began in 2018, the Washington-based think tank said in a report released Tuesday. The findings were based on satellite imagery taken in recent months by Maxar. The site – a research station China has hailed as a means to expand its scientific investigation in the Antarctic – could also be used to enhance the country’s intelligence collection, according to CSIS. China is far from alone in bolstering its presence and research activities in the frozen continent, where a number of countries including the United States, Britain, and South Korea all operate research stations. But attention has turned to potential dual-use of China’s facilities amid increasing power competition with the United States and Western concerns about Beijing’s assertive foreign policy and surveillance capabilities. The new station’s position, on Inexpressible Island near the Ross Sea, is triangulated with China’s other coastal stations on Antarctica to “fill in a major gap in China’s coverage” of the continent, and could support intelligence collection given its inclusion of a satellite ground station, according to the CSIS report. The station’s position may enable China to “collect signals intelligence from US-allied Australia and New Zealand” and “collect telemetry data on rockets launching from newly established space facilities in both countries,” it said. Once completed, the 5,000-square-meter (53,820-square-foot) station is expected to include a scientific research and observation area, an energy facility, a main building, a logistics facility and a wharf for China’s Xuelong icebreakers, according to CSIS. In February 2020, a team of US inspectors visited the station, where they were hosted by station leader Wang Zhechao of the Polar Research Institute of China. They found no military equipment or military support personnel at the site, according to a report of the inspection published by the United States State Department. Once completed the scientific research at the station would focus on physical and biological oceanography, glaciology, marine ecology, zoology, atmospheric and space physics and geology, the account said, citing a 2018 draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation about the project submitted by China to an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. China has established four scientific research bases in Antarctica since 1984, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A 2022 Department of Defense report on China’s military notes that “(China’s) strategy for Antarctica includes the use of dual-use technologies, facilities, and scientific research, which are likely intended, at least in part, to improve PLA (People’s Liberation Army) capabilities.” China, however has stressed the scientific nature of its ambitions in the region. In an address to researchers based in polar regions at the start of this year, then-Vice Premier Han Zheng hailed the teams’ contributions to “humanity’s scientific understanding and peaceful use of polar and ocean regions.” Han has since been appointed China’s vice president. Under the 1959 treaty Antarctic Treaty, to which China is party, activities on the continent are restricted to “peaceful purposes.” Military personnel are allowed to conduct scientific research, but may not set up bases, test weapons of carry out maneuvers.

      North Korea claims it’s ready to launch first spy satellite: state media
    ","North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un has ordered officials to prepare to launch the country’s first military reconnaissance satellite, North Korean state media KCNA reported on Wednesday. During his visit to the National Aerospace Development Administration on Tuesday, Kim Jong Un said the country’s military reconnaissance satellite production has been completed and ordered the dispatching of “several reconnaissance satellites,” KCNA reported. He made the visit alongside his daughter believed to be Ju Ae. She has attended numerous events alongside her father so far this year. Last December, North Korea claimed it had conducted an “important final stage test” for the development of a spy satellite. The country’s space development agency announced that it would finish preparations for the first military reconnaissance satellite by April 2023. Despite the North Korea claims, recent satellite images of the country’s space launch center show no signs of an imminent launch, said Dave Schmerler, senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in the United States. “But North Korea could launch this via a road mobile vehicle. So were all just waiting to see what they do,” Schmerler said. North Korea’s recent missile launches, including the test of an intercontinental ballistic missile last week, have come from mobile launchers. On Tuesday, Kim stressed the role of military satellites as to protect national safety and territorial stability in the midst of escalating military threats and challenges by the United States and South Korea. Kim also spoke about the role of satellites and its strategic value when deploying military force preemptively according to the situation, KCNA said. Kim said the acquisition of military reconnaissance satellites was “indispensable,” calling them a “right to national sovereignty and self-defense.” He cited tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the need for managing “prospective threats,” KCNA reported.

      Scientists film deepest ever fish on seabed off Japan
    ","Cruising at a depth of 8,336 meters (over 27,000 feet) just above the seabed, a young snailfish has become the deepest fish ever filmed by scientists during a probe into the abyss of the northern Pacific Ocean. Scientists from University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology released footage of the snailfish on Sunday filmed last September by sea robots in deep trenches off Japan. Along with the filming the deepest snailfish, the scientists physically caught two other specimens at 8,022 meters and set another record for the deepest catch. Previously, the deepest snailfish ever spotted was at 7,703 meters in 2008, while scientists had never been able to collect fish from anywhere below 8,000 meters. “What is significant is that it shows how far a particular type of fish will descend in the ocean,” said marine biologist Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, who led the expedition. Scientists are filming in the trenches off Japan as part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world. Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said. During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths. In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed. Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths. Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot. Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as Pseudoliparis belyaevi – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment. They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said. The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders. Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate. “The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.

      A weapons stockpile and asymmetric warfare: how Taiwan could thwart an invasion by China – with America’s help
    ","When Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen defied warnings from China to meet with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California earlier this month, Beijing’s aggressive military response reverberated around the world. In actions that only fueled fears that communist-ruled China may be preparing to invade its democratically ruled neighbor, the People’s Liberation Army simulated a blockade of the island, sending an aircraft carrier and 12 naval ships to encircle it, and flying over a hundred warplanes into its air defense identification zone during a three-day military drill. China’s ruling Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory despite never having controlled it, described the drills as “joint precision strikes” that should serve as a “serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces.” The message, in Taipei’s mind, seemed clear. China appeared “to be trying to get ready to launch a war against Taiwan,” the island’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told CNN’s Jim Sciutto. That blunt assessment will likely have raised doubts in some quarters over whether the island’s military preparations for such a scenario are sufficient. Taipei recently – and very publicly – announced an extension to mandatory military service periods from four months to a year and accelerated the development of its indigenous weapons program to boost its combat readiness. But analysts say a recent announcement – one that has perhaps gone less remarked upon in the global media – could prove a game-changer: talks between Taipei and the United States to establish a “contingency stockpile” of munitions on Taiwan’s soil. In remarks that were not widely picked up at the time, Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told Taiwan’s parliament in March that Taipei was in discussions with the US over a potential plan to set up a war reserve stock on the island – a measure made possible by a provision in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by US President Joe Biden last December. And while Taiwan has long been a purchaser of weapons from the US, military experts say the creation of such a stockpile could be vital to the island’s defense because – as China’s recently simulated blockade showed – it could be incredibly difficult to supply the island with additional weapons if war does break out. Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan has no land borders so any supplies would have to go in by air or sea – delivery methods that would be highly vulnerable to interceptions by the Chinese military. It is therefore vital for Taiwan to stock up ammunition on the island before any conflict begins, said Admiral Lee Hsi-min, who served as Chief of the General Staff for the Taiwanese military between 2017 and 2019. “Having a war reserve stockpile is crucial and meaningful for Taiwan,” he said. “Even if the United States does not want to intervene directly with military force, those kinds of stockpiles can still be very effective for our defense.” Taiwan has also repeatedly raised concerns about delays in US weapon deliveries amid the war in Ukraine. Following his meeting with Tsai, Speaker McCarthy tweeted: “Based on today’s conversations, it’s clear several actions are necessary: We must continue arms sales to Taiwan and make sure such sales reach Taiwan on time.” The talks over the possible stockpile beg the question: What exactly does Taiwan need for its defense? For decades, the Taiwanese military has been purchasing fighter jets and missiles from the United States, which continues to be the single biggest guarantor of the island’s safety despite not having an “official” diplomatic relationship. Last month, the Biden administration made headlines with its approval of potential arms sales to Taiwan worth an estimated $619 million, including hundreds of missiles for its fleet of F-16 fighter jets. But Admiral Lee said Taiwan urgently needed to stock up on smaller and more mobile weapons that would have a higher chance of surviving the first wave of a Chinese attack in an all-out conflict – which would likely include long-range joint missile strikes on Taiwanese infrastructure and military targets. In a high-profile book published last year, titled “Overall Defense Concept,” Lee argued that Taiwan should shift away from investing heavily in fighter jets and destroyers, as its military assets were already vastly outnumbered by China’s and could easily be paralyzed by long-range missiles. Last year, China’s defense budget was $230 billion, more than 13 times the size of Taiwan’s spending of $16.89 billion. So instead of matching ship for ship or plane for plane, Lee argued, Taiwan should embrace an asymmetric warfare model focused on the procurement of smaller weapons – such as portable missiles and mines – that are hard to detect but effective in halting enemy advances. “In Ukraine, their military has used Neptune anti-ship missiles to sink Moscow’s battleships,” he said. “Asymmetric weapon systems will allow us to maintain our combat capabilities. That is because if our enemies want to destroy them, they will need to get closer to us, which makes them vulnerable to our attack.” “If we can establish good enough asymmetrical capability, I believe China won’t be able to take over Taiwan by force, even without United States’ intervention,” he added. Though the US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, and is bound by law to sell arms to the island for its self-defense, it remains deliberately vague on whether it would intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.” Under this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, passed by the US Congress and signed by US President Joe Biden, Taiwan will be eligible to receive up to $1 billion in weapons and munitions from the United States to counter China’s growing military threat. The act also allows for the creation of a regional contingency stockpile, which would enable the Pentagon to store weapons in Taiwan for use if a military conflict with China arises. In a response to CNN for this article, a spokesman at Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed it is in discussions with the United States on the definition of a “contingency”, the types of munition that can be operated immediately by its armed forces, and the timeline for shipping the items. The ministry added that the move is aimed only at meeting Taiwan’s defensive needs, as opposed to “pre-stocking” munitions on the island. The US Indo-Pacific Command declined to provide details about the progress of talks on creating the stockpile but said it would continue to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability. Meanwhile, China’s Foreign Ministry told CNN that it “resolutely opposes” any military exchanges between the United States and Taiwan, adding that Beijing will take “all necessary measures” to defend its sovereignty and security interests. Lin Ying-yu, an assistant professor from Tamkang University who specializes in military affairs, said that if a contingency stockpile were to be created, it should focus on amassing munitions already in use by Taiwan’s military to ensure operational effectiveness. “I think some of the weapons that the US might be willing to provide include the Stinger and the Patriot missiles,” he said. The Stinger is a surface-to-air missile that can be fired by a single soldier, while the Patriot missile defense system is capable of intercepting enemy missiles and aircraft. Admiral Lee said another weapon that could be stockpiled was the Javelin, a US-made portable anti-tank weapon system that has been widely used by the Ukrainian military to target Russian tanks. The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, could also be useful for targeting Chinese warplanes, he said, as it was capable of firing the medium-range AIM-120 missile from ground level. Other weapons that should be considered included the loitering munition drone – a so-called “suicide drone” that can be carried by a single soldier and is capable of destroying high-value targets – as well as other anti-armor and anti-ship weaponry, he added. “If you have a high enough number of these kinds of asymmetrical weapon systems that survive the initial attack, you can keep most of your fighting capabilities intact and stop the enemy from conducting a landing operation,” Lee said. Another question that arises is how many weapons or missiles Taiwan would need to defend itself against China. Experts said providing a concrete number was difficult because the possible combat scenarios were so varied. In his book, Admiral Lee wrote that the Chinese military could resort to different options in attempting to bring Taiwan under its control. In an all-out war, China could fire long-range missiles to destroy Taiwanese infrastructure and military targets before attempting to send its ground troops across the Taiwan Strait. Other scenarios with limited military action could include an aerial and naval blockade around Taiwan, or the seizure of Taiwan’s small outlying islands that are close to the Chinese coast. However, Lin suggested the number of missiles that Taiwan likely needs would be in the “tens of thousands.” He said one relatively simple way of calculating the number of missiles required involves estimating the total number of offensive military assets owned by the enemy, and the effectiveness of Taiwan’s defensive weapons. “For example, if our enemy has 1,000 missiles and we have a success rate of 25%, then we will need about 4,000 anti-ballistic missiles.” In addition to weapons, Taiwan’s military could benefit from mobile radar systems that would enable it to receive military signals from the US, Lin added. These would be useful in conducting electronic warfare, as the US military would be able to help identify potential enemy targets even if ground radar systems had been destroyed. “Even though the United States does not have troops on the ground in Ukraine, it has been able to tell the Ukrainian military where to fire their weapons by sending signals from its electronic warfare aircraft,” Lin said. “We need to make sure we have the necessary equipment to link with US military systems at times of war.” There were other reasons the discussions with the US over the possible stockpile were important, Admiral Lee said, and they went beyond issues of storing up ammunition and spare parts. “(Having a contingency stockpile) is very crucial, because it sends a signal to China that the United States is determined to assist in our defense,” he said.

      Man sentenced for abducting girl from family’s tent at remote Australian campsite
    ","A man who admitted abducting a four-year-old girl from a remote campsite in Western Australia and holding her for 18 days during a massive police search has been sentenced to 13 years and 6 months in prison. Terence Kelly, 37, pleaded guilty to abducting Cleo Smith from the tent she was sharing with her family in the early hours of October 16, 2021, and was sentenced Wednesday in Perth’s District Court. Cleo’s disappearance triggered a police hunt that covered several square kilometers around the site and was later extended nationwide, as the state government offered a reward of one million Australian dollars ($676,000) for information leading to her location. For more than two weeks, police amassed evidence, including interviews, security video footage, phone data and calls from hundreds of people offering information as her distraught parents made desperate appeals for help to find her. Eventually the information pointed to a single-story house in the coastal town of Carnarvon, about 73 kilometers (45 miles) south of the campsite where she went missing. Four officers entered the house, not far from the family’s own home, just after midnight on November 3, 2021, where they found Cleo alone in a bedroom. During the sentencing hearing, the court was told Kelly went to the campsite looking for things to steal, but when he entered the family’s tent and saw the sleeping child he decided to “steal her.” At the time, Cleo was sleeping within meters of her mother, stepfather and baby sister, near the door of the zipped tent, draped in a sleeping bag. The court heard Kelly quietly gathered the child and the sleeping bag and drove her in his car to his home. Chief Judge Julie Wager said Kelly’s actions were at the “highest level of seriousness.” “This isn’t a case of luring a child away … but the taking of a little four-year-old girl from the zipped-up family tent in the middle of the night when her parents assumed she was safe is even more concerning,” she said. The court heard Kelly was aware of the huge police search for Cleo, but went about his “usual business,” regularly leaving the child alone in a room that locked from the outside. Cleo repeatedly pleaded for her parents, the court heard, especially her mother, but Kelly turned up the radio so the neighbors wouldn’t hear any noises she made. At one stage, Cleo heard her name on the radio and said, “They’re saying my name,” the court heard. Addressing Kelly, Wager said: “You were aware of this and, at an early stage, aware that the authorities were looking for her.” Kelly is eligible for parole two years before the end of his sentence, which was reduced because he pleaded guilty early, sparing Cleo and her family the trauma of testifying at trial, the judge said. Back in November 2021, the girl’s discovery after such an extensive search was celebrated by the police officers who found her. “To see her sitting there in the way that she was, was incredible,” Detective Senior Sergeant Cameron Blaine told reporters the day she was found. “I just wanted to be absolutely sure it was her, so I said, ‘What’s your name?’” he said. She said: “My name is Cleo,” according to police, who filmed the moment on bodycam.

      Nearly 8 million driver license numbers and passport numbers stolen in Australia
    ","Digital payments and lending firm Latitude Holdings said on Monday that 7.9 million Australian and New Zealand driver license numbers were stolen in a large-scale information theft on March 16. Apart from the driver licence numbers stolen, the Australian fintech firm also identified about 53,000 passport numbers were stolen, and fewer than 100 customers had a monthly financial statement stolen. A further 6.1 million records dating back to at least 2005 were also stolen, the Melbourne-based company said, adding that customers who choose to replace their stolen ID document will be reimbursed. “We are rectifying platforms impacted in the attack and have implemented additional security monitoring as we return to operations in the coming days,” said CEO Ahmed Fahour in a statement. Latitude’s stock fell 2.5% to 1.18 Australian dollars (about $0.78), with shares having dropped by about 2.1% since the company reported the incident on March 16. “Whenever investors hear of a ‘data breach,’ they tend to assume the worst … it seems much of the doom and gloom was priced in two weeks ago when news of the cyberattack first broke,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index. The current level does not make it a strong buy, but “investors clearly saw 1 Australian dollar as a decent level for a punt,” he added. The firm, which provides consumer finance services to major Australian retailers Harvey Norman and JB Hi-Fi, alerted last week that it had unearthed further evidence of information theft. Several Australian firms have reported cyberattacks over the past few months, and experts say this is due to an understaffed cybersecurity industry in the country. Last year, some of Australia’s largest companies reported data breaches, prompting authorities to step up efforts to bolster cybersecurity and implement stricter data-sharing rules to prevent breaches in the future. Earlier this month, Latitude took its platform offline and said the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre were looking into the attack.

      Question revealed for Australia’s first referendum in 24 years
    ","Australians have learned the question they’ll be asked later this year in the country’s first referendum in 24 years, a vote deemed so significant that the Prime Minister paused to gather his emotions Thursday as he announced the details. On a date to be set, Australians will be asked whether the nation’s Indigenous peoples, which make up 3.2% of the population, should be recognized in the Constitution. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the question during a news conference: “A proposed law to alter the constitution to recognize the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration?” “That’s the question before the Australian people, nothing more, but nothing less,” said an emotional Albanese, who paused for a few seconds mid-sentence as he thanked Indigenous leaders for their patience. “This moment has been a very long time in the making, yet they have shown such patience and optimism through this process. And that spirit of cooperation and thoughtful, respectful dialogue has been so important at arriving at this point in such a united fashion,” he said. A “yes” vote would recognize Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the Constitution and create an Indigenous body to advise the Federal Parliament on policies and projects relating to Indigenous people. Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney called Thursday’s announcement of the wording “a truly historic day.” “Today we take a big step forward on the long journey to constitutional recognition, through voice,” said Burney, a member of the Wiradjuri nation. “We believe that this is so just. We believe this will appeal to the fairness of the Australian people. And we believe that we have history on our side.” The wording of the question will be introduced to Parliament next week, and a parliamentary committee will be formed to consider submissions before a parliamentary vote in June. The referendum itself is slated for sometime between October and December this year. The government says it’s the country’s best chance to correct the wrongs of the past, committed after the colonization of the land with little regard for the views or welfare of its original inhabitants. More than 200 years later, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders still suffer much poorer health, mortality and economic outcomes than non-Indigenous members of the Australian population, according to government statistics. Successive administrations have tried to “close the gap” but incarceration rates of Indigenous people remain persistently high, and advocates argue racist attitudes are embedded within society adding a further barrier to progress. However, despite a strong government push for “yes,” the outcome is not guaranteed. The main opposition Liberal Party, voted out of office last May, has yet to announce whether it’ll back a vote in favor of the Voice to Parliament. Liberal leader Peter Dutton says he wants to see more detail about how it would work, a request considered by some as entirely reasonable and by others as a spoiler tactic to sow doubt. The National Party, which traditionally represents rural voters, has already ruled out supporting the Voice, calling it “another layer of bureaucratic red tape” that won’t advance the interests of Indigenous people. Some Indigenous groups say it’s not enough – they want Australia to first end its status as the only Commonwealth country not to have signed a treaty with its Indigenous population. The idea for a Voice to Parliament came about through a process of consultation with hundreds of diverse Indigenous groups who outlined their wishes in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. To pass, the referendum needs to win the majority of votes nationwide, and the majority of votes in the majority of states. Only eight of 44 referendums have ever been approved in Australia. The last one was held in 1999 when Australians voted down calls for a republic. Albanese said the wording of this year’s vote was devised during months of consultation with Indigenous groups and legal experts. “This form of words is legally sound, and it is a form of words that all of us have confidence will gain the strongest possible support from the people of Australia at a referendum and deliver the best possible outcomes in the years ahead,” he said.

      Former Australian soldier arrested for alleged war crime in Afghanistan
    ","A former soldier has become the first serving Australian serviceman or veteran charged with the war crime of murder for allegedly killing a civilian while on deployment in Afghanistan. The 41-year-old man was charged in New South Wales on Monday, according to a joint statement from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI). “It will be alleged he murdered an Afghan man while deployed to Afghanistan with the Australian Defense Force,” the AFP statement said. The maximum penalty for the charge is life imprisonment, the statement said. The man was remanded in custody and will face court at a later date, it added. His arrest follows a four-year investigation into alleged crimes committed by Australian forces in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016. In 2020, the long-awaited report by the inspector general of the Australian Defense Force concluded that Australian elite forces allegedly killed 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners unlawfully. The ADF recommended that 19 individuals from the Australian Special Forces be investigated over 36 alleged war crimes, including murder and cruel treatment of non-combatants in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2013. The inquiry described an environment where “blood lust” and “competition killings” were reportedly a norm. It alleged that some patrol commanders required junior soldiers to shoot prisoners to achieve their first kill, in a process known as “blooding.” The report presented what it said was “credible information” that weapons or handheld radios were then sometimes allegedly placed by a body to make it seem like the person had been killed in action. None of the 39 alleged unlawful killings happened in the heat of battle, according to the report, and the Afghans who died were non-combatants or no longer combatants. Monday’s AFP statement said it is continuing to work with the OSI “to investigate allegations of criminal offenses under Australian law related to breaches of the Laws of Armed Conflict by Australian Defense Force personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.” ",327,australia,2023-03-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/australia/former-soldier-charged-war-crime-afghanistan-intl-hnk/index.html

      US agrees to sell 220 Tomahawk missiles to Australia
    ","The US State Department has approved Australia’s request to buy up to 220 long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, making it only the second US ally to obtain the US-made weapon after the United Kingdom. According to a statement from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the deal will cost as much as 1.3 billion Australian dollars ($895 million), including maintenance and logistical support. “The proposed sale will improve Australia’s capability to interoperate with US maritime forces and other allied forces as well as its ability to contribute to missions of mutual interest,” the statement added. The deal’s approval comes the same week the US, Australia and the United Kingdom provided more details of AUKUS,  their three-way pact to share technology and resources to build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. Under that deal, the US will sell at least three Virginia-class submarines to Australia. Additionally, Australia and the United Kingdom will build their own fleets of new nuclear-powered subs to boost the allies’ capabilities in the Indo-Pacific, where China has been building its military assets. First deployed in the Gulf War in 1991, Tomahawk missiles fly at extremely low altitudes at high subsonic speeds and are controlled by several mission-tailored guidance systems. According to the US Navy, they can be launched from submarines made by the US and the UK, as well as from US Navy ships. So far only the UK has bought Tomahawks from the US, but recently Japan announced its intention to buy hundreds of the missiles, which cover a distance of more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles), to boost its defense capabilities. The Tomahawks could be used by the Royal Australian Navy’s Hobart-class destroyers and are also compatible with the Virginia-class submarines that Australia plans to buy from the US as part of the AUKUS deal. Australian Defense Minister Pat Conroy told the country’s national broadcaster, the ABC, Friday the weapons were a necessary deterrent. “This is part of this government’s agenda to give the ADF the best possible capability, to give it greater ability to provide long-range strike and keep any potential adversary at bay,” Conroy told the ABC. “This is how we promote peace and stability by putting question marks in any potential adversary’s mind.” While the multibillion-dollar AUKUS deal has the support of Australia’s two major political parties, it came under intense criticism this week from former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating. In a statement, Keating, who served as the country’s leader between 1991 and 1996, called it “the worst international decision by an Australian Labor government” in more than 100 years. “Australia is locking in its next half century in Asia as subordinate to the United States, an Atlantic power,” he wrote. Referring to the subs, Keating said, “The fact is, we just don’t need them,” arguing that more diesel-electric-powered submarines – an expansion of Australia’s Collins-class submarine fleet – would be sufficient to defend Australia’s coastline. The AUKUS deal is expected to cost up to $245 billion (368 billion Australian dollars) over 30 years.

      ‘History might repeat itself’: Chinese ambassador warns Australia to be wary of Japan
    ","China’s ambassador to Australia says Canberra should be wary of its relationship with Japan, reminding them that Japanese troops attacked Australia during World War II and could do the same again. “If we forget history, history might repeat itself,” said Xiao Qian, Beijing’s envoy to Australia, in a rare news conference Tuesday at the Chinese Embassy in Canberra. “During the Second World War, Japan invaded Australia, bombed Darwin, killed Australians and treated Australian POWs in a way that was humanly unacceptable,” Xiao said. The Chinese ambassador also incorrectly claimed that Japan had not apologized for its World War II actions concerning Australia, and could therefore repeat them. Xiao made the comments after a journalist asked about remarks made by the Japanese ambassador to Australia, Shingo Yamagami, who said Australia and Japan should remain “vigilant” in relation to China. “We have to be vigilant because when it comes to policy and strategy, nothing fundamental seems to have changed on their part,” Yamagami said in an interview published in The Australian newspaper Tuesday. Xiao, the Chinese envoy, said the comments suggested Yamagami had overstepped his role as ambassador. “My role as ambassador from China is to promote understanding, friendship and cooperation between China and Australia. It is not my role to base myself in Canberra, while criticizing a third country,” Xiao said. “It is not my role as a Chinese ambassador to Australia to try to stop Australia from developing a normal relationship with a third country. “So I’m afraid that our colleague from Japan is not doing his job.” CNN has reached out to Yamagami’s office but has not received a response. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted him as saying he was “baffled and perplexed” by Xiao’s comments. Japan did not invade Australia in World War II, but Japanese attacks did reach the continent. From February 1942 to the end of September 1943, Japan staged 97 air raids on military facilities and towns in northern Australia, with a raid on the town of Broome leaving 97 people dead. Also in 1942, Japanese midget submarines shelled areas of Sydney and Newcastle, while other subs attacked ships along Australia’s east coast, killing 60 people, according to the Australian government. And Australians were among the tens of thousands of allied military personnel captured and imprisoned by Japanese forces in World War II. Japan has apologized for its World War II actions concerning Australia, according to historical accounts. In 1957, during a trip to Australia, then-Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi said, “It is my official duty, and my personal desire, to express to you and through you to the people of Australia, our heartfelt sorrow for what occurred in the war,” according to accounts from the time. And in 2011, then-Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara apologized behind closed doors to five former Australian POWs who were visiting Japan, according to news accounts. While Australia-China relations have thawed in recent weeks with the visit of Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong to Beijing in December, China’s relationship with Japan remains rocky, especially after Tokyo announced in late December that it would be doubling its defense budget and acquiring long-range weapons capable of hitting China. Tokyo is wary of Beijing in regards to competing territorial claims from Taiwan and China on islands in the East China Sea that are claimed and controlled by Japan. Meanwhile, defense ties between Japan and Australia are strengthening, with their militaries holding joint exercises with each other and their mutual ally, the United States. Just last week, Australian paratroopers participated in an airborne assault exercise in Japan, and last year their leaders signed an agreement to streamline access to each other’s bases for their military forces. For the most part, Xiao’s comments on Australia were positive, and he indicated the relationship and trade issues between Beijing and Canberra would likely improve. But Xiao said there were “forces” in Japan who had “a twisted way of looking at China, a twisted way of looking at the relationship between China and Australia.” “I hope that our Australian government and the Australian people will have a clear mind about what happened and be careful about what might happen in the future,” Xiao said. “When somebody threatens you, he might threaten you again. China has been your friend. We will continue to be your friend.” ",718,australia,2023-01-10,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/australia/china-ambassador-australia-japan-attack-comment-intl-hnk/index.html

      Chinese acrobat falls to her death during mid-air performance with husband
    ","A Chinese acrobat has fallen to her death during an aerial silks performance, sparking horror and outcry on social media over the lack of safety measures. The woman, surnamed Sun, fell to the stage while performing a mid-air routine on Saturday with her husband in a village near the city of Suzhou in central Anhui province. She was taken to hospital but died of her injuries, the Tongqiao district government said in a statement Monday. Online footage of the incident showed the couple being pulled high into the air by a crane above a large outdoor stage, with the woman holding on to her husband whose arms were wrapped around two pieces of fabric hanging from the crane. As they swung in mid-air, the woman wrapped her arms around her husband’s head and hung off him during a transition act. But she lost her grip and and plunged to the hard stage amid screams from the crowd. Her husband attempted to catch her with his legs but failed, the footage showed. Videos of the horrific moment shocked Chinese social media. Many users questioned why the woman did not wear any safety belt, and why there was no safety net or crash mat on the ground. Others called for stricter regulations on the acrobatic industry and better protection for performers. “This kind of mid-air acrobatic performance is really dangerous. At least put a safety net underneath so the (performer) can be protected from falling,” said a comment on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform. “No matter how skilled the performers are, there will always be mistakes. How come there are no safety measures?” In another statement released Tuesday, the Tongqiao government said an investigation by authorities had ruled the tragedy was an accident. The show was hosted by a local farm business owner, who contracted the Anhui Yaxi Performing Arts Media Company to run the performance, the statement said. The company failed to obtain approval from authorities prior to the show, and failed to provide essential safety protection and emergency measures during the performance, the investigation found. The use of a crane in the performance was also a violation of regulations, it added. The company has reached an agreement on compensation with the family of the acrobat, and will be punished according to regulations, the statement said. China’s Acrobats Association said in a statement Sunday it was “devastated and shocked by the tragedy” and called for acrobatic groups and performers to pay greater attention to safety measures. The Paper, a state-run news website, reported that during the show, a host had boasted to the audience that in order to make the performance look “real,” the performers were not equipped with any safety measures. The report added that the female acrobat had been married to her husband for more than a decade and left behind two children.

      US-sanctioned Chinese defense minister meets Putin in Moscow, hails military ties
    ","Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s Defense Minister Li Shangfu met Sunday in Moscow, where the two hailed their countries’ close military cooperation. The meeting kicked off Li’s four-day visit to Russia – his first overseas trip since stepping into the role last month. It comes as Western countries have ramped up pressure on Beijing to push Putin to end his war against Ukraine. Li, a general and veteran of China’s military modernization drive, was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 over transactions with Russia’s state-controlled arms exporter Rosoboronexport, when he lead the Chinese military’s Equipment Development Department. Those transactions included Russia’s delivery to China of Su-35 combat aircraft in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, according to the US State Department. Li’s trip follows Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s state visit to Russia last month, in which Xi and Putin further cemented their countries’ ties and pledged to “deepen military mutual trust” and strengthen military exchanges and cooperation. During his meeting with Li on Sunday, Putin called Xi’s recent visit to Russia “very productive,” and said relations between Russia and China were developing well in all areas, including the military departments, according to a Kremlin statement. Military cooperation ️between the countries was “one of the most important areas that strengthens the remarkably trusting, strategic nature of relations,” Putin said. Li told Putin that trust between the two countries’ militaries has been “increasingly consolidated” and cooperation has yielded “fruitful results,” according to a readout from Chinese state media. China was ready to work with Russia to “strengthen strategic communication between the two militaries, strengthen multilateral coordination and cooperation, and make new contributions to safeguarding regional and global security and stability,” Li said, citing consensus between Xi and Putin. Ukraine was not mentioned in either side’s official readout of the meeting. China has claimed neutrality over the war in Ukraine and called for peace in the conflict. But it has also refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or make any public call for Russia to withdraw its troops. Its officials have instead repeatedly said that the “legitimate” security concerns of all countries must be taken into account and accused NATO and the US of fueling the conflict. Nevertheless, European leaders have expressed hope that Xi could use his rapport with Putin to push for peace. Several leaders traveled to the Chinese capital in recent days in an attempt to advance such aims. During a joint press conference with her Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Xi’s recent visit to Moscow indicates that no country has a larger influence over Russia than China. “In the same fashion as how China mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia, we want China to use that influence to urge Russia to end its war in Ukraine,” Baerbock said, referring to a recent Beijing-brokered deal that saw the two long-standing Middle Eastern rivals restore diplomatic ties. Her visit followed a joint trip from French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in which Ukraine was high on the agenda. A joint statement from Macron and Xi released by the Elysee, however, failed to see the Chinese leader depart from Beijing’s previously stated positions on the war. Meanwhile, the US and its allies have repeatedly raised concerns that China was considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s war effort – a claim Beijing has denied. The two countries have continued to run joint military exercises around the world since the Russian invasion. Li is expected to remain in Moscow until Wednesday. He will hold talks with Russian military officials and visit Russian military academies during the visit, a ministry spokesperson said last week. Li took up the largely ceremonial post of defense minister last month during the annual meeting of China’s rubber-stamp legislature. He is also a member on the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Military Commission, which controls the military in practice.

      World leaders are lining up to meet Xi Jinping. Should the US be worried?
    ","Xi Jinping has had a busy couple of weeks. Since late last month the Chinese leader has hosted heads of state and government chiefs from Spain, Singapore, Malaysia, France and the European Union – an unusual pace of diplomatic activity that comes as countries look to Beijing as the global economy sputters in the wake of the pandemic and war in Ukraine. On Friday, that list grew to include Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is expected to sign a host of bilateral deals with Xi – and, like several of the leaders before him, arrives with hopes of making progress toward ending Russia’s war in Ukraine. But for Xi, this revolving door of visiting leaders – making the trip even as China has refused to condemn the Russian invasion – is also an opportunity to assert his vision for a global order not dictated by American rules – and push back against perceived threats. That’s especially urgent for the Chinese leader now, observers say. Three years of scaled-back diplomacy due to China’s strict Covid-19 controls coupled with economic challenges, entrenched competition with the United States and rising European concerns about Beijing’s foreign policy have left Xi under pressure to act. “(Chinese leaders) believe it’s time now for China to make its strategic plans,” said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. “A potentially good outcome is to weaken American alliances … so that’s why we’re seeing quite strenuous efforts made by Beijing to try to stabilize and improve relations with European countries, and also to try to improve and strengthen cooperation with emerging economies,” he said. As world leaders return to Beijing despite international concerns over the growing China-Russia relationship and Beijing’s intimidation of Taiwan, Xi has used the opportunity to thread his conversations with veiled criticism of the US and keywords that signal Xi’s own view for how to reshape global power. Speaking to Singapore’s Lee Hsien Loong late last month, Xi stressed that Asian countries together should “firmly oppose bullying, decoupling or severing industrial and supply chains,” while he urged Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to “resolutely resist the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation.” To Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez that same day, he warned that the “sound development of China-EU relations requires the EU to uphold strategic independence,” according to readouts from the Chinese side. Beijing has watched uneasily as the war in Ukraine has driven the US and its European allies closer. Now, analysts say playing up its economic partnerships and exploiting differences between countries on the two sides of the Atlantic is key. When French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Beijing last week, Xi drew comparisons between China and France: both “major countries with a tradition of independence,” Xi said, and “firm advocates for a multi-polar world” – or a world without a dominant superpower. After a day of meetings in Beijing, Xi met Macron in the southern commercial hub of Guangzhou to continue an “informal” conversation – sipping tea and listening to the plucked melodies of traditional Chinese music before a state dinner. Macron, who has long advocated for Europe to develop an independent geopolitical policy and defense capabilities that needn’t rely on Washington, appeared receptive. He released a 51-point joint statement with China outlining cooperation on areas from nuclear energy to food security and told reporters traveling with him that when it comes to the US-China rivalry Europe must not be “caught up in crises that are not ours, which prevents it from building its strategic autonomy,” according to a Politico interview. Macron’s comments have sparked backlash in Europe and the US, but analysts say they were likely seen as a triumph in Beijing. “Everything that can weaken the US, divide the West and move countries closer to China is good for Xi,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. “Hence, Macron’s trip is seen in Beijing as a major victory.” Xi may be preparing for another potential diplomatic win when he meets Lula on Friday. The leftist Brazilian leader, who ushered in a boom in China-Brazil trade ties during his first stint in power some two decades ago, is traveling with a delegation of business leaders, state governors, congressmen and ministers, and expected to close a raft of bilateral deals from agriculture and livestock to technology. Lula’s return to power already shifts the dynamics of the China-Brazil relationship, which saw tense moments under former leader Jair Bolsonaro, who embraced anti-China rhetoric. Lula has already started out his state visit in Shanghai with a nod to Brazil and China cooperation, attending the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s inauguration as head of the New Development Bank of BRICS, the bloc of emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa that offers an alternative power grouping to the Western-centric G7. “Xi will find in Lula a BRICS enthusiast, openness to reforms in the global governance system and the desire to avoid automatic alignment with the US,” said Luiza Duarte, a research fellow at American University’s Center for Latin American and Latino Studies in Washington. Meanwhile, Lula’s expected warm welcome in Beijing “raises comparison with his frustrating less than 24-hour visit to Washington,” she said, referring to the Brazilian leader’s February 10 visit to the White House. The meeting was seen at the time as a key outreach from the newly inaugurated Lula to the US. But Beijing may use the “lack of deliverables” from that meeting “to position itself as a more appealing alternative for bilateral cooperation,” said Duarte. Looming over diplomacy in Beijing is the Russian assault in Ukraine. Some leaders – like Macron – have viewed Xi, a close friend and diplomatic partner of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as a potential ally that could help push Putin toward peace. But their relationship has also raised concern, with US officials earlier this year warning that China was considering providing the Kremlin with lethal aid – a claim Beijing has denied. While France and China agreed to several points related to the war in their meeting – including opposition to attacks on nuclear power plants and the protection of women and children – Macron did not ultimately push Xi to commit on paper to any position China has not already publicly said. Brazil, in advance of Lula’s trip, has offered another view: creating – as the country’s foreign minister put it – “a group of mediator countries” including China. But how Beijing navigates these initiatives, observers say, comes down to a bottom line that’s integrally related to Xi’s global ambitions and world view. “It will be difficult for China to respond positively to some of the requests made by either the Americans or Europeans, because doing this would produce the risk of making the Russians upset,” said Li in Singapore. “Russia is the only major power that shares a lot of (China’s) views on how the world and the global system should look and how various political issues should be handled. Russia is irreplaceable for China,” he said. That point was highlighted in another moment on Xi’s recent diplomatic agenda: his travel to Moscow in March for his own state visit – the first since he stepped into a third presidential term that same month. And while China’s diplomacy – and deals – in the past week may not have been heavily impacted by the optics of that relationship, analysts say how Beijing handles the conflict will continue to affect views on China globally. Perceptions about Xi’s potential influence over Putin have provided “leverage that allows (Xi) to get a lot of attention, and perhaps get mileage and support that he would otherwise not have,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore. “Ultimately, the test will come down to whether Xi is actually able to exert any real influence on Putin, especially in terms of ceasing the war,” he said.

      US ‘disappointed’ by Chinese court’s decision to uphold death sentence for American citizen
    ","The US State Department said Thursday it is “disappointed” by a Chinese court’s decision to uphold the death sentence for American citizen Mark Swidan and called for his immediate release. “Today the People’s Republic of China’s Jiangmen Intermediate Court denied wrongfully detained US national Mark Swidan’s appeal, and upheld his death penalty with a two-year suspended death sentence,” State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement. “We are disappointed by this decision and will continue to press for his immediate release and return to the United States,” Patel said. Swidan, a businessman from Texas, has been detained in China for more than a decade since he was arrested in 2012 on drug-related charges. He was convicted of manufacturing and trafficking drugs in 2019 by the Jiangmen Intermediate People’s Court in southern Guangdong province and given a death sentence with a two-year reprieve. Under Chinese law, the reprieve means Swidan’s sentence may be commuted to life imprisonment after two years, subject to his conduct during this period. A United Nations working group concluded in 2020 that Swidan had been arbitrarily detained in violation of international law and urged his immediate release. CNN could not reach the Jiangmen Intermediate People’s Court for comment. His mother, Katherine Swidan, told CNN earlier this year that her son had been detained in what she described as a “holding tank,” where she said he had undergone physical and psychological torture and attempted suicide. “He’s been in there for 10 years, where they never turn the lights off, so as a result, he’s going blind. He’s got fractures in his leg,” she said, telling CNN that guards at the facility “broke his hands five to seven times.” “He’s suffering and he’s got an infection. He has severe periodontal disease. He has holes in his mouth that bleed constantly. He’s lost 130 pounds,” Katherine said. Patel, the State Department spokesperson, said in his statement Thursday American officials had “repeatedly expressed their concerns” to senior Chinese officials about Swidan’s “treatment, medical care, and his inability to send or receive mail in a timely manner.” US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken “continue to remain personally focused on the release of Mark Swidan and other US nationals wrongfully detained or held hostage across the world,” Patel added. Katherine Swidan and family members of other Americans detained by China had urged Blinken to make securing their loved ones’ freedom a top priority before his expected trip to Beijing in February. But the trip was postponed in response to the flying of a suspected Chinese spy balloon over US airspace.

      Record rise in China’s sea levels threatens coastal cities like Shanghai
    ","Sea levels on China’s coastline have hit their highest on record for the second year in a row, rising more quickly than the global average and posing a serious threat to coastal cities such as the financial hub of Shanghai. In 2022, China’s coastal sea levels were 94 millimeters (3.7 inch) higher than “normal,” defined as the average over the 1993-2011 period, making it the highest since records began in 1980, an official at the Ministry of Natural Resources said Wednesday at a news conference. The swell was 10 mm higher than in 2021, when the previous record was reached. The temperature of China’s coastal waters has increased significantly due to global warming, and the rise in sea levels has accelerated, said Wang Hua, head of the marine forecasting and monitoring department at the ministry. China’s sea levels have increased by an average of 3.5 mm per year since 1980, and an average of 4.0 mm per year since 1993 – higher than the global rate over the same periods, Wang said. The global mean sea level has risen 3.4 mm a year over the past three decades, according to NASA. “In the last 11 years, from 2012 to 2022, China’s coastal sea levels were the highest since observations were first recorded,” Wang said at the news conference, which released the latest annual report on China’s sea levels. About 45% of China’s population of around 1.4 billion and more than half of the country’s economic output comes from coastal regions. The Chinese coast is home to important metropolises including Shanghai, the country’s most developed and richest city, as well as the port city of Tianjin and the tech hub of Shenzhen. Over the past four decades, rising sea levels along the Chinese coast have caused long-term effects, including the erosion of coastal ecosystems and the loss of tidal flats. They have also affected groundwater supply and increased the damage caused by storms, floods and salt tide intrusion, Wang said. While the sea swelled, land in coastal regions had sunk, exacerbating the problem, he added. In 2022, high sea levels along the Chinese coast aggravated the impact of storms, dealing a severe blow to the provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang and Shandong. The rises also contributed to heavy coastal flooding in Zhejiang and Hainan province, causing great economic loss, according to Wang.

      Xi Jinping vows to make China’s military a ‘great wall of steel’ in first speech of new presidential term
    ","China’s leader Xi Jinping on Monday vowed to bolster national security and build the military into a “great wall of steel,” in the first speech of his precedent-breaking third term as president. Speaking at the closing of the annual meeting of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, Xi underscored the need to comprehensively modernize national defense and the military. “(We must) build the People’s Liberation Army into a great wall of steel that effectively safeguards national sovereignty, security, and development interests,” Xi told the nearly 3,000 delegates of the National People’s Congress (NPC). Xi, 69, was unanimously endorsed by the NPC as China’s president for another five years in a choreographed and ceremonial vote Friday, making him the longest-serving head of state of Communist China since its founding in 1949. At the start of his speech Monday, Xi thanked the delegates for his reappointment. “This is my third time assuming the lofty position as president. The trust of the people is the biggest driving force for me to move forward, and also a heavy responsibility on my shoulders,” he said. Like his many previous speeches, Xi struck a nationalist tone, citing the hardships China suffered at the hands of “bullying foreign powers” in the modern era and noting how the Communist Party has led the country to “wipe clean the national humiliation.” “The Chinese people have become the masters of their own destiny,” he said. “The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process.” According to Xi the “essence” of that rejuvenation is “national unification,” namely “reunifying” Taiwan with mainland China. The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and refuses to rule out the use of force. Under Xi, Beijing has ramped up economic, diplomatic and military pressure on the island democracy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Beijing has not condemned, has also increased fears Xi might look to do something similar in the years ahead. “We must… actively promote peaceful development of cross-strait relations, firmly oppose interference of external forces and Taiwan’s separatist activities, and resolutely advance the process of national reunification,” Xi said to a loud burst of applause in the Great Hall of the People. Xi also called for China to better coordinate development and security. “Security is the foundation for development, stability is the prerequisite for prosperity,” he said. Over his first decade in power, Xi has unleashed sweeping reforms on the Chinese military to make it a modern fighting force, and built its navy into the largest in the world. China’s annual military budget will increased by 7.2% this year to roughly 1.55 trillion yuan ($224 billion), amid rising geopolitical tensions and a regional arms race. He has also consolidated his control over both the military and civilian arms of government to become China’s most assertive and dominant leader in a generation. The emphasis on strengthening security and military comes as China’s relations with the United States are stuck at their lowest point in decades, with tensions soaring across sectors from trade and technology to geopolitics, especially the future of Taiwan. Last week, in unusually direct remarks, Xi accused the US of leading Western countries to “contain and suppress” China and bring it “unprecedented severe challenges.” Xi’s new foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned that if the US doesn’t “hit the brakes,” the two superpowers will surely descend into “conflict and confrontation.” ",570,china,2023-03-13,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/china/china-xi-jinpong-first-speech-third-term-intl-hnk/index.html

      Spain exhumes fascist founder’s body as sympathizers salute and sing
    ","Spain on Monday dug up the body of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of the fascist Falange movement that supported the Francoist regime, and removed it from a mausoleum carved into a mountainside near Madrid as sympathizers gave fascist salutes. A handful of supporters gathered outside the gates of the complex formerly known as the Valley of the Fallen made the gesture and held up banners saying “José Antonio is present” or shouted “Long live Spain” as his hearse drove past. Police struggled to hold back a larger crowd of about 150 Falange supporters gathered outside the San Isidro cemetery in southern Madrid, where he was to be reburied. They gave the fascist salute and sang the Falangist hymn “Facing the sun.” The exhumation, which follows the 2019 removal of the remains of dictator Francisco Franco, is part of a plan to convert the complex built by Franco, which last year was renamed the Valley of Cuelgamuros, into a memorial to the 500,000 people killed during Spain’s 1936-39 civil war.Presidency Minister Felix Bolaños on Friday hailed the exhumation as another step in giving the valley new symbolism. “No person or ideology that evokes the dictatorship should be honored or extolled there,” he said at the time. The son of dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, who governed Spain from 1923-1930, José Antonio was shot by firing squad in November 1936 by left-wing Republican forces in Alicante. It is the fifth time his body has been buried and the fourth time it has been exhumed. In 1939, after having lain in two different mass graves in Alicante, his coffin was paraded 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the eastern coastal city to San Lorenzo de El Escorial, a town near Madrid where Spain’s royals are buried. His remains were moved again on the completion of the Valley of the Fallen monument 20 years later and buried under the altar of the basilica, where Franco would join him on his death in 1975. Franco, a conservative general, and Primo de Rivera, a flamboyant playboy, had little love for each other, according to Franco’s biographer, Paul Preston. Franco sabotaged several efforts to organize a rescue or a prisoner swap that would have saved Primo de Rivera’s life, Preston wrote in his biography. His death allowed Franco to eliminate a rival and take control of the Falangists, subsuming them to a broader far-right movement that supported his dictatorship. The government is carrying out works in the mausoleum to permit access to the crypts where the remains of 34,000 people, many of them victims of Franco’s regime, are buried anonymously, allowing families to identify their relatives.

      Analysis: Will Italy’s PM stop the boats or will the boats stop her?
    ","The key campaign promise that brought Giorgia Meloni and her far-right coalition to power in a landslide victory in last September’s election was a vow to do what no one else had done before: stop migrant boats using Italy as a gateway into Europe. “Blocco navale,” her social media screamed (“Naval blockade now!), complete with photos of overcrowded smuggler ships. On the campaign trail she promised to halt all migrant boats from landing on Italian shores, no matter who was on them and what drove them to risk their lives. Her first hundred days in office were deemed a success. She was nowhere near as far-right as some had feared, and the multilingual career politician was at ease with global world leaders. Liberal European leaders stood to gain from the prospect of Meloni’s promise to stop the boats, and many hoped she could pull it off. Conservatives like Hungarian leader Viktor Orban heralded her win, and thanked her for “protecting Europe’s borders.” She even managed to bring wily coalition partners Matteo Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi in line despite differences over the war in Ukraine. Meloni rode out several storms, including Berlusconi’s admission admitting he had rekindled his bromance with Vladimir Putin after Putin sent over Russian vodka for his birthday. She sparred with Salvini over how to handle the energy crisis and his own affection for Putin. By late January, she seemed unstoppable. Then the boats started coming, and coming, and coming. By April 21, more than 35,000 people had arrived by boat, a number more than three times higher than the year before. By contrast, just over 4,000 people have arrived in the UK so far this year across by boat from France. A recent poll showed that support for Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party – which won elections with 34 percent of the vote – has fallen to just over 29 percent in opinion polls. Some believe that no one ever expected her to be successful stopping boats, so the drop in the polls reflects other issues, including her continued support for Ukraine and her relationship with China. Italy has signed up to China’s Silk Road project, an ambitious, global infrastructure scheme some analysts view as a worrying sign of growing Chinese influence. “Migrants and the EU are high on her watchlist, but there are other issues that threaten her more,” Francesco Galietti, founder of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political risk consultancy, told CNN. “Meloni will not be crippled by migrants, but if she can’t opt out of the Silk Road Agreement with China, and do it firmly, then she will not get an invitation to the White House.” But not everyone is ready to give her a pass on migration. “This is a serious issue, I think this is the most relevant crisis that she’s facing and the most relevant challenge for her government now,” Giovanni Orsina, director of the School of Government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, told CNN, adding that she is addressing migration on two fronts: by putting pressure on Europe and by taking it very seriously at home. He says to most Italians, the migrant crisis is still something they hear about, not something that impacts them directly. “The turning point (is) when the migrants stop headlining the news and start becoming the people in front of their homes, you find them in the streets and squares in small Italian towns, then it becomes existential not abstract.” Irregular migration into Europe has been one of the most divisive problems in the bloc for years. But blocking boats on the last leg of the journey to Europe is essentially addressing a symptom of a problem, not the problem itself, Hanne Beirens, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, told CNN. “If you ask migration experts if she could stop boats, the answer would be no,” she said, adding that the only thing that has ever stopped migration was the Covid-19 pandemic. Beirens says that until Europe can agree together how to address the problem issue at the root, by offering opportunities to apply for asylum earlier in the journey and working to solve problems in countries that produce the most migrants and refugees, the boats will keep coming. “There are high expectations with these promises, and when they are not able to manage a chaotic situation, we’ll see member states going it alone and deciding unilaterally to use pushbacks, violence at the border, or worse,” she says. Meloni has done just that by declaring a state of emergency over the migrant crisis, which will allow extremely tough measures to handle arrivals, including allowing authorities that normally handle natural disasters to swiftly repatriate migrants. Orsina says the state of emergency buys her time. “It also allows her to cut corners in Italian bureaucracy and it sends a message to the country that the problem is being tackled seriously, but it is also a way to better organize the people who come here.” The measure is being boycotted in several left-leaning regions; Elly Schlein, the leader of the opposition Democratic party, likened the decree to something from the Fascist era. Meloni’s election win was an astonishing moment in Italian politics, not only because of her party’s rapid ascent from the right-wing fringes. She was not only Italy’s youngest and first female prime minister, she was also and its first elected leader since 2011, having won such a healthy majority that post-election politics as usual were put aside. The people had spoken, and they wanted her and all she stood for. Now whether she can follow up on her promises to voters is the question on everyone’s mind.

      What kind of justice will Ketanji Brown Jackson be?
    ","CNN Opinion asked contributors to weigh in on President Joe Biden’s selection of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US Supreme Court. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the contributors. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an eminently qualified public servant with distinguished experience as a federal judge, and her historic nomination promises an end to the erasure of Black women from our most sacred legal institutions. She brings extensive litigation experience at every level of the federal court system, including distinguished service as a federal public defender. As a district court judge, she ruled on over 550 cases and is renowned for her careful, methodical approach to ensuring equal justice under the law on reproductive rights, disability rights and workers’ rights. Frankly, this is a nomination that should unite the country. Diversity strengthens the integrity of the institution to the broader public and, in particular, the many Black women who face many of the harshest injustices of our system today. It’s critical for the US Supreme Court to understand the impact of its rulings in the real world, and it can’t do that until it reflects the country it governs. Jackson will move us closer to a more fair and just system for women, for Black Americans and for everyone on the side of equality before the law. It is incumbent upon US senators to give her a fair and timely confirmation without obstruction, honoring their constitutional duty to advise and consent – and their moral duty to treat her with the respect and dignity she deserves. ​​Fatima Goss Graves is president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center. First things first: it’s about time. It’s long past time. For the first time in the history of the US Supreme Court, a Black woman has been nominated as a Justice. And, to be clear, you will not find a more qualified nominee than Judge (likely soon-to-be Justice) Kentaji Brown Jackson. She graduated from Harvard, both undergrad and law school. She clerked for a federal district court judge and then, in a nice bit of symmetry, nabbed a mega-prestigious clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer, who she now stands to replace. She worked in private practice and for the US Sentencing Commission before she became a federal district court judge in 2013. Last year, she was nominated as a federal appellate judge, winning confirmation with 53 votes, including three Republicans. I have seen her in action on the bench, and I came away exceptionally impressed. In the case I covered, she was prepared, sharp, incisive and fair. Senate Republicans can act one of two ways in the wake of Jackson’s nomination. They can dig in and oppose it, but they don’t have much of substance to work with – and they’ll likely lose anyway, given the current Democratic Senate majority (which will presumably be coupled with the votes of three Republicans who supported her federal appellate judgeship). Or Republicans can pick their battles and throw their support behind Jackson, given her qualifications and the seeming inevitably of her confirmation. Maybe it seems quaint – Breyer himself was confirmed by an 87 to 9 vote back in 1994, which now seems impossible – but it also could be smart politics. Elie Honig is a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, and author of “Hatchet Man: How Bill Barr Broke the Prosecutor’s Code and Corrupted the Justice Department.” In selecting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill Stephen Breyer’s seat on the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden has fulfilled his campaign pledge to nominate the first female African American justice. Biden selected Jackson for additional reasons, of course. Jackson has impressive credentials, and Biden likely feels confident that Jackson will implement the results-oriented, make-it-up-as-you-go-along  “living constitutionalism” that progressives espouse. Biden has already demonstrated that differences in judicial philosophy justify efforts to oppose the confirmation of the first female African American justice. Back in 2005, he even threatened to filibuster President George W. Bush’s possible nomination of DC Circuit judge Janice Rogers Brown to the Supreme Court. The left is likely to make accusations of racism and sexism in response to any concerns expressed over Jackson’s vision of the judicial role. But if Senate Republicans assess Jackson on the basis of judicial philosophy, and don’t succumb to political pressure because of her race and sex, they will responsibly fulfill their constitutional duty to advise and consent. The Democrats have control of the Senate, albeit slim control, so Jackson will almost certainly be confirmed. The process will probably be rather quiet. But Senate Republicans should use the opportunity to emphasize that judging is a craft that is distinct from policymaking. They can reinforce the message that the duty of a Supreme Court justice is to discern and apply the meaning that constitutional and statutory provisions bore when they were adopted, not to rewrite those provisions to advance an ideological agenda. Ed Whelan holds the Antonin Scalia Chair in Constitutional Studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. A former law clerk to Justice Scalia, he is co-editor of “The Essential Scalia: On the Constitution, the Courts, and the Rule of Law” and of two other volumes of Scalia’s work. For me, the power of seeing a Black woman nominated to the highest court in the land is without equal. But what is also extraordinary is that she will be a former federal public defender – a position she held for 2 1/2 years – in a country with a legal system still aspiring to be a justice system. As a prosecutor, I wielded a tremendous amount of power in the exercise of my discretion to pursue (or decline to pursue) charges and autonomy in the way I met my burden of proof. But like the power held by a co-equal branch of government, the power of prosecutors must be checked – not to disrupt the pursuit of justice but to further it. In a country where race and bias are far too frequently elevated above fairness, public defenders are the welcome foil to balance the system. The relationship between public defenders and prosecutors may be necessarily adversarial, but it is always symbiotic. Prosecutors get all the credit (and blame) for ensuring accountability, as if they alone believe in it. The public may mistakenly view those who represent the accused as soft on crime. Indeed, if past is prologue, I expect such an absurd talking point to emerge during Jackson’s confirmation hearings. But public defenders are not soft on crime – they are hard on injustice, which is precisely where we as a society must be. And precisely where a Supreme Court justice ought to be. I sincerely hope Jackson is afforded the dignity she ensured for the presumed innocent: due process, fairness, equal protection from an abuse of power and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. After all, it’s the US Supreme Court. Laura Coates is a CNN senior legal analyst and author of “Just Pursuit: A Black Prosecutor’s Fight For Fairness.” She is a former assistant US attorney for the District of Columbia and trial attorney in the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. Coates is the host of the daily “Laura Coates Show” on SiriusXM. Follow her @thelauracoates. One thing that’s always said when there’s a US Supreme Court nomination is that presidents are often surprised by how their choices turn out. Presidents think the future justice will vote one way, and they wind up voting another way. Don’t believe it. Especially in recent years, the art of picking Supreme Court justices has been refined to a science. All nine of the current justices largely vote in ways that would please the presidents who nominated them. That’s likely to be true if Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is confirmed as well. The myth of the surprised president dates principally from the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, who nominated Earl Warren and William Brennan to the Supreme Court and found, to his dismay, that they were both powerful and outspoken liberals. Here’s one thing to know about the Eisenhower administration: it was a long time ago. In those days, the court was not the public political battleground that it has become, and Eisenhower’s choices were motivated more by politics than ideology. (Eisenhower had promised the seat to Warren, then the governor of California, and he chose Brennan to appeal to Catholic voters on the eve of his 1956 reelection.) It’s true that President George H.W. Bush’s appointment of David Souter in 1990 ranks as a modest surprise, but his behavior as a moderate on the court was consistent with both his own earlier record as a judge and Bush’s overall approach to social issues. Also, 1990 was a long time ago. In recent years, though, as the court has become the focus of fights on such issues as abortion, guns and affirmative action, ideology has become the main criteria for selections. Presidents (as well as their advisers and supporters) care a great deal about the possibility of ideological mistakes. So they don’t make them. President Joe Biden wanted a judicial liberal, and that’s what he will get with Jackson. She will not surprise him, or us. Jeffrey Toobin is CNN’s chief legal analyst and the author of “The Nine” and “The Oath.” Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination is an important step in addressing the injustices in the US judicial system, but it’s not the only step we need to take. America’s legal system has always looked different for Black women, who have historically been discriminated against. That will not change until we see more Black women jurists like Jackson in positions of legal power, and that begins with empowering Black women to be the leaders  they deserve to be. Jackson is the ideal role model in this regard. Her record is one that has championed equity and justice . She fought to defend the rights of incarcerated individuals, issued rulings that protected labor and women’s rights and upheld the integrity of our constitution when it was under attack by the Trump administration. Along with her wealth of judicial expertise, she also brings with her experiences and identities that have never been enjoyed by another Supreme Court justice – and have been sorely missed in the highest court in America. I look forward to her swift approval process through the US Senate and hopefully to her being seated on a bench that doesn’t require her to bring her own folding chair. A’shanti F. Gholar, former national deputy director of community engagement and director of African American Engagement for the Democratic National Committee, is the president of Emerge, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office. President Joe Biden simply could not have done better than his choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the United States Supreme Court. In the world of law, credentials don’t get better than hers. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she clerked for judges in the federal district court and the federal court of appeals. She was also a clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, who she is now poised to replace. Jackson has had extensive experience in a variety of settings and has served as a federal judge since 2013. She also brings to the court experiences and perspectives the current justices lack. Most obviously, she is the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Jackson will also be the only justice on the current court to have worked as a public defender. She has significant experience as a trial judge, something only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has among those now on the high court. As I think about what makes for a great justice, Jackson has it all: keen intelligence, enormous experience, unquestionable integrity, a terrific judicial temperament and a vision of justice. She should be confirmed swiftly by the Senate and start what will hopefully be a long career on the Supreme Court. Many will rightfully point out the fact that she won’t change the current ideological balance of the court by replacing Breyer. But if Jackson is still a justice in 2040 and 2050, she may be a stabilizing force on a very different court. Erwin Chemerinsky is dean and Jesse H. Choper Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. He is the author of “Presumed Guilty: How the Supreme Court Empowered the Police and Subverted Civil Rights.” Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s nominee to fill the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer’s seat on the Supreme Court, has it all. She is a highly accomplished lawyer and an experienced jurist with the sterling educational and clerkship credentials expected of someone about to ascend to the pinnacle of the legal profession. And, as a Black woman, Jackson will bring a historic perspective and important representation to the nation’s highest court. Jackson shares all of the above characteristics with the other two final candidates Biden was considering: California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger  and US District Judge J. Michelle Childs.  All three women are also 55 or under; nominating someone relatively young has become close to mandatory in recent years for Supreme Court nominees of presidents of both parties since justices can serve for life. But what distinguishes Jackson from the others, and what very well may have led to her selection, is her service as a criminal defense lawyer, both as a federal public defender and in private practice. She offers the kind of professional diversity that has become one of the calling cards of Biden’s judicial nominations strategy. Biden is right to prioritize elevating judges who bring different backgrounds and experiences to the courts, especially to the Supreme Court, where not a single justice has Jackson’s experience defending criminal cases. The Supreme Court needs more diversity, of all kinds; hopefully Jackson will be the first step in making that become a reality. Jennifer Rodgers is a former federal prosecutor, adjunct professor of clinical law at NYU School of Law, lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a CNN legal analyst. The legal profession is plagued by elitism. It’s easy for me to say this, having attended Ivy League schools myself, but prestigious academic institutions do not confer much of anything that can’t be gained from other schools. Of the nine justices currently on the Supreme Court, however, eight have degrees from Harvard or Yale. If confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who has two Harvard degrees, will perpetuate the Ivies’ dominance on the Supreme Court. While I will be the first to argue that the Supreme Court desperately needs justices with more varied educational backgrounds, in Jackson’s case, her credentials from an elite institution are a good thing. Here’s why. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced he would fulfill his promise to put a Black woman on the court – an uncontroversial statement given past presidents’ commitments to make barrier-breaking nominations  – a US senator went on the record to call the eventual nominee a “beneficiary” of affirmative action. Another senator expressed doubts about whether the nominee would know “a law book from a J. Crew catalog.” A prominent conservative took to Twitter and predicted the nominee would be a “lesser black woman.” (He later deleted the tweets and apologized, calling it “inartful.”) At their cores, each of these statements was a manifestation of disbelief that – gasp! – a Black woman might be just as qualified as any other previous nominee to serve on the Supreme Court. Black people face enough barriers in workplaces as it is. For instance, job applicants with “Black-sounding” names are less likely to get interviewed than their White counterparts, and Black women with natural hairstyles are seen as less professional and competent. I speak firsthand in saying that being Black and successful in America is a constant exercise in having to prove you are worthy. That struggle doesn’t end in the marble halls of the Supreme Court. If, today, Jackson’s having two Harvard degrees and an otherwise airtight resume is what it takes to quiet at least some of the criticism, then so be it. Elliot Williams is a CNN legal analyst. He is a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department. Follow him on Twitter @elliotcwilliams. In Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden has put forth a US Supreme Court nominee with impeccable credentials and a stellar legal background. In addition to her degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she brings diverse professional experience to the high court; she has worked at large and small firms, as a public defender, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, where she backed a proposal to reduce federal drug trafficking sentences. This type of varied experience will serve her well on a court that often seems out of touch and has seen its public approval rating drop. According to Associated Press polling, the majority of African Americans say it’s very or extremely important that a Black woman serves on the Supreme Court, and the President has now delivered on a key promise. Jackson will likely earn support from Latino advocacy groups as well, as our communities have much in common in the struggle for civil rights and social justice. Jackson’s rulings on immigration are also important, as congressional inaction and legal challenges to immigration policy have given the Supreme Court an outsized role on this issue. Although in several cases she sought to protect the rights of migrants, she also denied a challenge to Trump’s border wall – so no one can accuse her of favoring “open borders.” Most importantly, whether ruling for or against migrants, Jackson has avoided using terms like “illegals” or “aliens.” As the National Immigration Law Center notes, this acknowledges the basic humanity of immigrants. The Supreme Court holds immense power over our daily lives, on issues ranging from health care to the environment to reproductive and voting rights. At a time when many Americans have lost faith in institutions, Jackson will help restore trust and stability to the high court. Her historic nomination deserves bipartisan support. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. President Joe Biden’s nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman Supreme Court nominee in the court’s history is a tremendous moment for America. After a rigorous process, Jackson has proven that she has the experience and character to do this vital job. As a Black woman, I am thrilled for what this means for me, my daughter and my community. While I rejoice in the historic nature of her nomination, I also want to celebrate the incredible qualifications Jackson brings to this role. A daughter of teachers, she went to Harvard Law School, has served in nearly every part of our legal system and brings that kind of well-rounded experience that we need on the highest court. It’s no wonder that she has been confirmed three times on a bipartisan vote. Unfortunately, even being an impeccably qualified nominee who has been praised by both former President Barack Obama for being an “unwavering voice for justice and fairness” and by former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who gave her “unequivocal” praise for her integrity and intellect, Jackson will almost certainly face racist and sexist comments that come with being the first. At EMILY’s List, we have seen far too many history-makers and ground-breakers have their accomplishments questioned and their qualifications undermined. But we know what Jackson’s example proves: to be the first and to break the mold, you bring qualifications, experience and character that is unrivaled. I am proud to support her and look forward to the legacy she will hopefully create on the court. Laphonza Butler is the president of EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics. Butler grew up in Magnolia, Mississippi and served as a union leader and adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. Every US Supreme Court nomination presents an opportunity for Americans and our elected leaders to reflect on the court’s crucial, singular role in American government: to decide cases under the rule of law, according to the constitution and laws of our country. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was recognized as the frontrunner for this seat because she is a respected judge on one of the nation’s most important courts. Her discussions with US senators, in visits and in the public hearing, will be an ideal forum for serious constitutional debate. Judicial nominees are rightly reluctant to prejudge issues, especially when the nominee is a sitting judge. If Jackson follows this tradition, then senators will have all the more incentive to ask her about the bigger picture: her view of the court’s role in government and its responsibility to faithfully interpret the laws as written. In an era when the Supreme Court is enduring partisan attacks on its legitimacy, and facing dangerous threats to pack the court for partisan purposes, it is crucial for senators – and all Americans – to know that the next justice is committed to preserving the rule of law and the court’s indispensable constitutional role. Adam White is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. In 2021, President Joe Biden appointed him to the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States. The nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson – the first Black woman ever nominated to the US Supreme Court – is an historic and exciting moment. She is an immensely qualified judge who will bring a new, much-needed and long-overdue perspective to the court. Not only that, Jackson has a demonstrated record of upholding reproductive freedom, a critical consideration with the right to abortion facing unprecedented attacks. Jackson’s nomination comes at a pivotal moment for the court. Her confirmation won’t change the balance of the court or the outcome of the looming decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization – the case directly challenging Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion. However, we must seize this chance to confirm a justice who will work to protect our most cherished rights and freedoms and help to shape the future of our country in the decades to come. The anti-choice movement and its political allies spent decades working to install their ideologues on our nation’s highest court. The confirmations of Trump’s justices to the Supreme Court cemented a majority that is unmistakably hostile to abortion, and that won’t be easily undone. But confirming justices like Jackson is how we move closer to a future in which all of our families and communities thrive – a future in which there is equal justice for all of us. With so much on the line, we can’t leave anything on the table in our fight to confirm Jackson to the court. Mini Timmaraju is the President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, an organization that advocates for abortion access in USA. ​​With Russian troops on the march in Ukraine, Americans have not been sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting to see whom President Joe Biden will nominate to the US Supreme Court. Instead, they are glued to their television sets wondering if Russian President Vladimir Putin is crazy enough to trigger World War III in his quest to rebuild the former Soviet Union. Biden’s attempt to change the subject from war, inflation and the economy to the Supreme Court may hurt Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation prospects. The timing of this announcement means the White House has lost an important opportunity to rally the public behind Jackson before Republicans go on the offensive. No doubt, Biden’s nominee is highly qualified for the position. Jackson checks all the right boxes – she holds a Harvard Law degree, clerked for federal judges and served as a public defender. She now sits as a federal appellate judge on the prestigious DC Circuit Court. She appears to be widely respected in the legal profession, and progressives have already applauded Biden’s decision to nominate her. Republicans, on the other hand, are likely to say that she is too radical for the Supreme Court. Ironically, her biggest obstacle to a swift confirmation is more likely to be Putin than Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. With Americans more focused on the war in Ukraine than the Supreme Court, Jackson’s confirmation is unlikely to get the attention it deserves. Americans will need an opportunity to get to know Jackson, and the initial publicity surrounding any nominee serves an important educational purpose. Without that public support, Jackson could be more vulnerable to damaging attacks from the GOP. Announcing Jackson’s nomination at this moment, given the current crisis in Ukraine, is a rookie mistake for a president languishing in the polls. As a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden seems to have forgotten that even in the selection process for Supreme Court nominees, timing is everything.

      ‘Bridgerton’ is back, and I think I’m in love
    ","In incredible news for everyone who has found the last year and three months since season 1 came out a bit much, “Bridgerton” is back. In tragic news for my mum, Regé-Jean Page – aka Daphne Briderton’s new husband and reluctant baby daddy, the Duke – isn’t returning with it. Fans will have to make do with Anthony Bridgerton, Daphne’s hotheaded eldest brother played by Jonathan Bailey, as their new leading man. In this sophomore season, Anthony takes center stage, as of course does his love life. This focuses quickly on two sisters, Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), who is the season’s belle and therefore the ideal choice, and the older, marriage-averse Kate (Simone Ashley), to whom the Viscount Bridgerton is naturally, immediately attracted. Having spent season 1 either in bed with his now-ex girlfriend or channeling his frustrations at their forced estrangement by dueling his best friend, Anthony has sworn off romance in favor of a resigned, clinical approach to marriage. With the prospects of his younger siblings to consider, he has vowed to find a mate appropriate to care for them and the future Bridgerton line – a choice that must be weighed independently of love. It’s a fluffy, addictive, entirely watchable disaster waiting to happen. Anthony was the bad boy in season 1, in many ways the shagging, chaotic, antithesis of the stoic, simmering Duke. Every time I watched the show, at least one viewing companion would huff when Anthony came on screen, dismissing “that prick” before heaving a gratified sigh upon the Duke’s next appearance. It was an understandable response. What indeed would be the point of a show whose entire m.o. is sensory overload, if we didn’t embrace Page’s concupiscent allure? In the extenuatory spirit of “Bridgerton,” however, I think it’s worth giving Anthony a little more credit – or, at the very least, enough to justify our inevitable transference of affections this spring. It’s a low bar, but Anthony isn’t actually more problematic than the hero of season 1 – and doesn’t benefit from the years of Regency romance novel programming that, I’d argue, largely explain the audience’s more immediate sympathy for the Duke. While the Duke is a distracting, enticing fantasy, Anthony is essentially making it up as he goes along, masking his passions and fears behind bravado and stomping. Unlike the most famous Regency heroes, the “Pride and Prejudice” and “Emma” crowd who tend to be passively courted by mothers and daughters determined to snag advantageous matches, or harbor depths utterly at odds with the face they show the world, Anthony wears his goal plainly, crassly on his sleeve, and has set about fulfilling it himself. The Duke’s habitual silence and harboring of secret demons very much fits the Mr. Darcy-style template every Jane Austen fan is hardwired to eat up. We’re primed to anticipate his redemption and ultimate union with Daphne, so we view his behavior leading up to that point charitably. He lies about the reason he won’t have kids? Of course he does, his dad was mean to him! Gaslights the woman who loves him when she calls him on that lie? He’ll make it up to her! Characterizes the barest hints about masturbation as a full debrief on sex and reproduction? He did his best! And he looked incredible! Poor old Anthony is messier. While the Duke’s “rakish” past is primly referred to in gentlemen’s clubs and during “promenades” in the park, our first introduction to Anthony sees him making vigorous love to a woman against a tree. We don’t learn until later that she’s his girlfriend Siena, who he secretly supports financially. Anthony’s lust is framed from the get-go as an evasion of responsibility, while the Duke’s is just part of his red-blooded charm. Though both men initially eschew marriage, Anthony’s relationship to the institution is more authentically tortured than the Duke’s in season 1 – his own mother’s great love with his now-dead father looms over the action like an ideal he fears he can never live up to. As the show proceeds, Anthony’s lack of any recognizable endgame exposes his flaws in a far harsher light than the Duke. But though he also acts clumsily on selfish impulses, Anthony is much more honest about his feelings and motivations. When the Duke appears to have taken up with Daphne, Anthony tells him that though they’re good friends, family has to come first – and he’s just not keen on his little sis dating someone he knows to be a total, ahem, “rake” during her all-important first season. After he challenges the Duke to a duel, he goes right to Siena to give her the heads-up on his potential change of circumstances, and when it turns out he can’t run away with her after all, he offers to support her anyway. Though he’s constantly messing up, Anthony learns from (some) past mistakes – especially when it comes to letting Daphne choose her own mate and lecturing his younger brothers about their own romantic choices. He then gets a pretty rough deal when his mom orders him to give up Siena, even though she tells Daphne emphatically that she only cares about her marrying for love, but he shoulders it alone. His upfront, emotional approach in the first season having ended in heartbreak, and the fate of his family still weighing heavy on him as its head, it’s no wonder Anthony is resigned to manage his life along more practical lines thereafter. It’s important at this juncture to stress just how rooted in fantasy “Bridgerton” is. It suggests that a strikingly bigoted country – one which failed miserably to accept a non-White royal in the 21st century, let alone the 19th – has managed to dismantle structural racism in a generation, all because the king made a Black woman his queen. Lady Danbury, played by Adjoa Andoh, refers to the fact her family is accepted by society thanks to this unprecedented union – which doesn’t really tally with its presumably long-established noble lineage, but sounds encouraging. All this to say, literally nothing is beyond the redemptive power of love in this show. As far as its audience is concerned, Anthony should be no exception, not least because of how familiar he is. As a man – an early 19th century one at that – who is not allowed by society to show vulnerability, it’s no wonder that his many insecurities manifest as arrogance. Privileged, immature, impulsive, brain-in-their-pants Anthonys are everywhere. He’s a damn sight more real than a romantic hero like the Duke, whose deceit is “really understandable, when you think about it,” and who improves if you just give him enough space. In real life, men who habitually lie by omission tend not to change. Half-grown guys like Anthony on the other hand, might – especially once they learn to communicate their emotions in a less explosive way. This would definitely take longer than a summer season in reality, but in magnolia-scented fictional Mayfair, anything is possible. Men whose wealth and status have allowed them to do as they please their entire lives always remain emotionally infantile. Patriarchy hurts men too, albeit so much less than women, and it’s inevitable that men who fall victim will turn other people into scratching posts for their confusion and frustrations. The glossy, candy-cane world of “Bridgerton” offers an infinitely safer forum for Anthony to work through his demons than real life might, but he’s still a randy, confused man-child with seven siblings to father. And, as they would in real life, the classism, sexism and puritanical values that hurt everyone are hurting him too.

      Kim Kardashian doesn’t deserve this
    ","After years of bad behavior, Kanye West is finally seeing some consequences. The rapper was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after hurling a racial slur at “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah, who had devoted a segment of his show to calling out West’s behavior toward his former wife, Kim Kardashian. West’s performance at the Grammy Awards, which Noah is hosting, was also canceled – although not at Noah’s request. Three sources close to West confirmed to CNN that he was pulled from performing at the Grammys due to “concerning online behavior.” West has spent the past several months using his social media platforms to target his ex-wife, Kardashian, and her new boyfriend, “SNL” star Pete Davidson. West has posted complaints about Kardashian’s parenting, saying it’s on him to protect his family and suggesting that perhaps his ex is a bad parent. He released a music video depicting a Davidson lookalike being kidnapped and buried in the ground. Both Kardashian and Davidson have reportedly asked West to stop. By West’s own account, Kardashian is scared. West posted a series of text messages purported to be from Kardashian asking him to please stop his social media attacks on her and her new partner: “U are creating a dangerous and scary environment and someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault,” the message said. Along with the text screenshots, West posted, “UPON MY WIFE’S REQUEST PLEASE NOBODY DO ANYTHING PHYSICAL TO SKETE IM GOING TO HANDLE THE SITUATION MYSELF.” He included an image of one man choking another. That wasn’t enough to get West suspended from social media. Apparently, going after Trevor Noah was. The lesson being sent to powerful men is clear: Intimidate your ex and much of the public will laugh, especially if she’s the kind of woman the public thinks kind of deserves it. It’s also safe to assume that women who raise concerns about what your ex is going through will have a hard time being heard. Go after a well-liked man who seeks to amplify that concern, though, and you’ll pay a price. To be clear, West should have been suspended for what he said about Noah. But his actions toward Kardashian and her new partner are just as concerning – if not more so. West practically put a target on both Kardashian’s and Davidson’s backs. And he made clear that he would like to physically harm Davidson, in part to hurt Kardashian. Why were his posts still up on Instagram? Why, in the middle of this very public series of online attacks, was he invited to perform at the Grammy awards to begin with? Instead of seeing this for what it is – a famous man using his notoriety to torment his ex – too many media outlets are portraying it as a “feud.” In a feud, there are two sides fighting each other. This is an attack. Kardashian is a professionally successful, beautiful celebrity who is notoriously “famous for being famous” as a reality TV star. That seems to be shaping too much of the public response to her current situation. As Noah made clear in his segment, instead of seeing her as a victim of a very public stalking and harassment campaign, media narratives and fan responses position her as one player in a juicy drama. For many West fans, she’s the villain breaking up her family, and West is a good man scorned. And even some prominent media figures, including The View’s Sunny Hostin, have argued that removing West from performing at the Grammy’s is a form of silencing free speech. West, on the other hand, has long had issues with women, and the public has simply laughed. When he grabbed the mic from Taylor Swift at the 2009 Video Music Awards, interrupting her acceptance speech, much of the public laughed it off – sure, West was a “jackass” as former President Barack Obama put it, but that was just Kanye being Kanye. Years later, he bragged that he “made that b**** famous” in one of his songs. (Kardashian, for what it’s worth, stood up for West.) West also trashed his ex Amber Rose after their breakup in crude and scurrilous terms, saying, “I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim.” One person who does seem to understand the reality of this dynamic between West and Kardashian is Trevor Noah. “You may not feel sorry for Kim because she’s rich and famous,” Noah said in the same “Daily Show” segment that drew West’s ire. “But what she’s going through is terrifying to watch and shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave.” Noah’s accurate assessment of the Kardashian/West dynamic predictably set West off – nothing angers misogynist men quite like being called out for their actions. But it shouldn’t have taken a racial slur to finally, temporarily pull West’s social media access and remove him from a place of honor at the biggest night in music. His behavior toward his ex should have come with its own public consequences. One of the reasons many women struggle to leave abusive or otherwise unhealthy relationships is fear: Fear of how their ex will behave, and fear that they will face social penalties. We’re collectively seeing those fears come to fruition for Kardashian. The very public shrug-off of West’s scary actions sends a message to women and men alike: Stalking and harassment are normal parts of ending a relationship; men who stalk and harass their exes won’t face consequences; and women who are stalked and harassed can expect that they’ll be treated as wrongdoers and heartbreakers, not victims. Thankfully, there are men like Noah who use their platforms to identify this dynamic for what it is. But it shouldn’t take a good famous man to speak up for a badly behaving one to finally see consequences.

      Before you share your next Wordle score, remember this
    ","Wordle, the word-guessing game that swamped social media feeds at the start of 2022, has now passed from fad to fixture: On Monday, The New York Times announced it had paid “in the low seven figures” to acquire the game. Soon Wordle will join the stable of popular online games offered behind the Times paywall (though the paper says Wordle will “initially” remain free for users). For such a simple game – players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word – the story of the Wordle craze is surprisingly complex. There is the business story about the Times, a newspaper whose digital-subscription revenues have soared not only because of its journalism but because of its array of online games and recipes. There’s the social media story about the game’s rapid spread, aided by the (to many, annoying) ease with which players can share their results in a pleasingly graphic form to Twitter and Instagram. But there’s also a cultural story: Wordle, like most games that capture the public imagination, is overwritten with some of the key anxieties and tensions of our time. Wordle is, first and foremost, a pandemic story. Told as a love story in the pages of the Times, the game’s creator, Josh Wardle, developed it for his partner, an avid word-game player. That idea – that a game created as an act of love soon won the hearts of millions of players – is a pleasantly wholesome respite from the start of a grindingly unpleasant new year (thanks, Omicron). It also allows a moment of shared experience at a time when, in parts of the country, in-person events have been canceled. Yet unlike the lose-yourself-for-hours games that dominated the early pandemic months, from low-tech jigsaw puzzles to the omnipresent Animal Crossing, Wordle meets the needs of a mostly open, still-chaotic country that has refilled its empty calendars but still faces the disruptions of constant testing and unexpected closures and quarantines. A game takes only a few minutes to play, and the platform offers only one game a day. Once you’re done, you’re done – the perfect late-pandemic pastime. Its acquisition by the Times, however, highlights another social aspect of playing Wordle. Sharing Wordle scores is not just an act of community but, in some ways, a boast of intelligence. Solving a Wordle with just two or three guesses feels not lucky but savvy: a combination of intellect and cleverness. Its introduction into the Times universe alongside the newspaper’s storied crossword puzzles and word-nerd Spelling Bee game only underscores that quality. The virtue of playing word games comes not only from the atmosphere of intellect around the games, but also the belief that such activities help keep aging brains nimble, improving memory and warding off dementia (the scientific evidence on this is mixed). It is the same virtue-washing that happens when someone sits down with a glass of red wine and a square of dark chocolate while murmuring that the after-dinner indulgence is an effort to maintain heart health. But that too is a product of our cultural moment. When crosswords were first introduced to the United States in the 1920s, they were laden with the anxieties of that time: worries that they were mindless entertainment on the level of comic strips, distractions from more serious endeavors. The New York Times, in fact, refused to run crosswords in its pages because the game was, as a 1924 editorial put it, “a primitive sort of mental exercise.” It only reversed course after the United States entered World War II and New York began dealing with regular blackouts. Times editors decided that New Yorkers had earned a distraction from the heavy news found in the rest of the paper. Nor were crosswords the last gaming trend to spark hand-wringing from people worried that players were ignoring more virtuous pursuits. Video games, first in arcades and then at home, regularly drew charges that they contributed to juvenile delinquency. Those fears intensified when put alongside concerns about guns and violence, culminating in congressional hearings about violence in video games that led to a new rating system developed by the gaming industry. Worries about the anti-intellectualism of gaming, a mainstay of video game criticisms since the mid-20th century, have in recent years broadened to include anxieties about all screen time, whether it’s an interactive game, Twitter-scrolling, watching YouTube videos or TikToks or texting with friends. It’s not surprising, then, when games seem to require a new level of justification: Pokémon Go and Wii weren’t just games, they were fitness regimes. Wordle, Spelling Bee and all those other word games keep brains sharp. Even more mindless pursuits like Candy Crush could be written down as a few moments of self-care. And while that’s not the worst way to think about the games we play, it does betray a puritanical streak in American culture: a sense that pleasure must be qualified, that fun must be intellectualized, that vice must be transformed into virtue. But as we enter the third year of the pandemic, with all the tragedy and monotony and sacrifice it has brought, now seems like the right time to insist that pleasure is a virtue in and of itself.

      India’s endangered tiger population is rebounding in triumph for conservationists
    ","Tigers once roamed across Asia, their numbers as high as 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, before the species plummeted to the brink of extinction. By 2006, their population in India – home to the majority of the world’s remaining wild tigers – hit a record low of just 1,411 individuals. But decades of conservation efforts appear to have finally paid off. India’s tigers have more than doubled since then, reaching 3,167 last year, according to the latest tiger census released Sunday. That’s about 70% of the world’s wild tiger population, which stands at around 4,500, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The resurgence of Indian tigers represents a triumph for conservationists, and a ray of hope for other countries struggling to boost wildlife numbers. The report was released alongside celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of Project Tiger, the government’s conservation program launched in 1973. “We have thousands of years of history related to tigers … The tiger is considered our brother in many tribes,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an address on Sunday. “A better future for humanity is only possible when our environments are protected and our biodiversity continues to expand.” Modi also visited two tiger reserves on Sunday, with photos showing the leader decked in a safari hat and camouflage clothing. Tiger numbers began falling steeply in the 1940s as human populations boomed. Agricultural expansion, deforestation, and infrastructure have fragmented tiger habitats, according to the WWF – particularly devastating given tigers are solitary animals who require large territories to roam and hunt. Today, tigers exist on just 7% of the land they used to occupy, according to the WWF. This dwindling space has meant a rise in human-tiger conflict, with multiple incidents in the past few decades of tigers attacking humans and entering villages in search of food. And they’re not alone – India’s endangered elephants, too, frequently wander into farmlands and devour crops. Though environmental degradation is a problem facing countries worldwide, India’s exploding population poses a unique challenge. In 1971, the country had 547 million people; it now has 1.4 billion, and is set to overtake China to become the world’s most populous country this year. Unregulated poaching in the 1980s further accelerated the decline in tiger numbers. Tigers were hunted for sport, status and consumption, with their bone and other parts often used in traditional Chinese medicine. India officially banned tiger hunting in 1972, but it remains a major threat, with illegal poaching blamed for the complete extinction of tigers within an Indian reserve in 2005. Efforts to reverse the trend has seen India develop 53 tiger reserves covering nearly 75,800 square kilometers (about 7.5 million hectares), up from just nine reserves at the start of Project Tiger. Authorities have relocated and paid entire villages to make space for tigers, and created wildlife corridors to link their fragmented habitats. The government has also invested in technology like drones, camera traps and software systems to keep track of tiger populations, movements and behaviors. There are plenty of challenges ahead, the WWF cautioned. The worsening climate crisis spells trouble for vulnerable habitats. Many tiger reserves and protected areas are “small islands in a vast sea of ecologically unsustainable land use,” with human activity encroaching on tiger environments. And illegal poaching continues despite strict laws. Still, the return of the tiger population is encouraging – and India is beginning to share its conservation practices with other countries with declining tiger numbers. In recent years, Delhi has signed bilateral agreements and launched initiatives including conservation workshops with Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Bhutan. And, as Modi pointed out in his Sunday address, similar successes are being seen with other species; India welcomed its first newborn cheetahs in March more than 70 years after the big cats were declared officially extinct in the country. The cubs were born to two rehabilitated cheetahs brought from Namibia to India, as part of a government plan to re-home 50 individuals over the next five years.

      The fatal mauling of 4-year-old forces India to grapple with stray dog problem
    ","For nearly a minute, the 4-year-old boy attempts to valiantly escape the hungry pack of stray dogs as they circle around him. The boy, who has not been publicly identified, is dragged by the pack for several feet. He strives to wrestle from their grip, but his small and fragile body cannot compete with the aggressors. His piercing screams alert his father nearby – but it was too late. The child was declared dead upon arrival at the hospital. The brutal attack, captured by a security camera in Hyderabad in February, a sprawling city in the central Indian state of Telangana, has horrified the nation of 1.3 billion and placed focus on an issue that long divided opinion: what to do with India’s vast number of stray dogs? The issue is a sensitive one in a country where there is an ingrained cultural respect for animals and an aversion to culling. Most agree stray dogs are an issue, but there is a fierce debate over how best to respond. According to the Press Trust of India, there are around 62 million strays in the country, although experts say the real number would be nearly impossible to verify. Most of these animals – lovably nicknamed ‘Indie’ dogs – live in harmony with humans. Often, residents of gated communities come together to feed them, some even adopting them as family pets. But over the years, bites and killings by stray dogs have put many cities on edge, with politicians, the media, and citizens scrambling to present various solutions. Long before the death of the 4-year-old boy in Hyderabad made headlines, local media have run similar tales about India’s “killer dogs” – stories that are then often picked up by international outlets. “”Man-eater’ dog terror back in Bihar,” wrote The Telegraph India in a story last month after a series of bites in the northern Indian state. It is illegal to kill stray dogs in India. A 2001 law states strays should instead be picked up, neutered, and vaccinated against rabies, before being released. But in light of the gruesome attacks, many of which have happened to children, some have attempted to challenge the law. In 2016, a campaign to kill stray dogs after a series of bites in the southern state of Kerala gained traction in the local news. But animal rights activists were angered, instead urging authorities to offer clemency and find other solutions. The hashtag #BoycottKerala began trending on social media, and the plan was later abolished. While the law requires strays to be neutered and vaccinated, experts say there is a lack of strict implementation. “Of course we have a stray dog problem,” Anjali Gopalan, managing trustee at the All Creatures Great and Small, a Delhi-based non-profit that cares for animals, said. “Not only do we have a stray dog problem, but we also have a problem with rabies in this country. So, steps have to be taken to deal with both.” Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease which can spread to humans if they are bitten or scratched by an infected animal. It is almost always fatal unless a series of jabs can be administered soon after someone is bitten. Dogs are the source of the vast majority of human rabies deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and contribute up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans. India is endemic for rabies, the WHO said, accounting for 36% of the world’s rabies deaths. A key way to reduce rabies within a stray dog population is to capture and vaccinate as many animals as possible. But veterinarian Sarungbam Devi, founder and trustee of Animal India Trust, said India needs to do more. “At the time of the sterilization, we vaccinate the dog only once and then they are released. That’s all the vaccination a stray dog gets in his lifetime and that’s not enough,” she said. A lack of resources in the country means it is difficult to push government bodies to increase the inoculation of street dogs against the virus, Devi added. But when it comes to dog bites, Devi said, education plays the biggest role: “The government hasn’t done anything to increase awareness or educate the masses. We need to educate people, we need to be more vocal and visual about the (anti-bite) programs,” she said. “People need to know what to do when a dog bites you, how to you prevent it … I don’t think I have ever seen anything on this anywhere.” The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) recommends avoiding unfamiliar dogs and wild animals, not running when approached by an unknown dog and always supervising children and dogs, among other things, to avoid bites. According to the government, more than 6.8 million Indians were bitten by stray dogs in 2020 – and increase from 3.9 million in 2012. And experts say those numbers are likely not the full picture. CNN has reached out to the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying but has not received a response. “The problem is lack of awareness towards how to live around dogs,” Devi said, adding there needs to be an “intense anti-rabies drive and sterilization program everywhere in India.” But many Indian cities and states have been successful in bringing down their feral dog population and eradicating rabies. In the financial capital Mumbai, as many as 95% of the city’s stray dogs have been sterilized owing to “consistent” implementation of re-vaccination and welfare programs, said Abodh Aras, CEO of the non-profit Welfare of Stray Dogs. A robust public health system for post-bite treatment and regular school programs about dog bite and rabies prevention has also contributed, Aras said. “There are other places that have success stories. There is Goa that has eliminated rabies, (the state of) Sikkim that has got its state of operations around, and eliminated rabies,” he added. “It needs a combination of government support, will and infrastructure, and animal welfare NGOs working in that area for this model to be successful.” But not every city has the resources to implement this model. Take for example Noida, a satellite city of more than half a million on the outskirts of Delhi that is a comparatively wealthy place and home to many middle-class families. Devi, from the Animal India Trust, said Noida remains “very disorganized,” and her organization is the only non-profit covering the entire city – a colossal and tedious task for a small team, she said. Gopalan, from All Creatures Great and Small, points to even more difficult operations in rural India, where electricity is lacking and maintaining cold storage for vaccines is an issue. Following the 4-year-old’s death in Hyderabad, officials promised swift action to prevent future tragedies. “We have been sterilizing dogs and anti-rabies injections are being given to them,” Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Mayor Vijayalaxmi Gadwal, told local news agency, ANI. “So far in Hyderabad we have identified more than 500,000 dogs and sent more than 400,000 dogs for sterilization. We are following every guideline which is being given to us by the Supreme Court. We’re also going to adopt these dogs so that the number of stray dogs will be reduced.” That campaign may have an impact locally. But it many fear it is likely only a matter of time before another pack of dogs somewhere in India takes a child’s life.
