      3-day Sudan ceasefire announced by US Secretary of State
    ","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday announced that the warring factions in Sudan agreed to a a ceasefire, “starting at midnight on April 24, to last for 72 hours.” The agreement between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, came “following intense negotiation over the past 48 hours,” Blinken said. “The United States urges the SAF and RSF to immediately and fully uphold the ceasefire,” Blinken said. “To support a durable end to the fighting, the United States will coordinate with regional and international partners, and Sudanese civilian stakeholders, to assist in the creation of a committee to oversee the negotiation, conclusion, and implementation of a permanent cessation of hostilities and humanitarian arrangements in Sudan.” In a written statement Monday, the RSF said it had agreed to the truce “in order to open humanitarian corridors, facilitate the movement of citizens and residents, enable them to fulfill their needs, reach hospitals and safe areas, and evacuate diplomatic missions.” Previously agreed ceasefires have broken down, although brief lulls in the fighting have allowed foreign civilians to evacuate Sudan to safety. If the new three-day cessation of fighting holds, it could create an opportunity to get much-needed critical resources like food and medical supplies to those in need. It could also allow for the safe passage of the “dozens” of Americans who Blinken said have expressed interest in leaving Sudan. Although a number of nations are evacuating their citizens, US officials have repeatedly said they do not plan to evacuate Americans from the country due to conditions on the ground. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN’s “This Morning” Monday the situation in Sudan “is not conducive and not safe to try to conduct some kind of a larger military evacuation of American citizens.” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday, however, that the US government is “actively facilitating the departure of American citizens who want to leave Sudan” through means like overland convoys. All US government employees were evacuated from Khartoum in a US military operation and the US embassy was “temporarily” closed this weekend after a week of heavy fighting between rival military factions which has left hundreds dead and thousands wounded. Multiple foreign powers have scrambled to rescue embassy staff, diplomats and nationals in recent days, even as many Sudanese are stuck in deteriorating and deadly conditions. French Foreign Minister spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre told CNN’s Isa Soares on Monday that France had evacuated approximately 500 people including almost 200 of them from 36 other countries. Saudi Arabia rescued 10 Saudi nationals and 189 foreigners including Americans from Port Sudan, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a written statement on its official Twitter account on Monday. South Korea and Japan were the latest nations to confirm new evacuations of their citizens on Tuesday. But many foreigners remain. President Joe Biden has asked for “every conceivable option” to help Americans who remain in Sudan, Sullivan said. “Right now, we believe that the best way for us to help facilitate people’s departure is in fact to support this land evacuation route, as well as work with allies and partners who are working on their own evacuation plans as well,” he said at a White House briefing. Blinken, who noted that the US does not have specific counts of how many Americans are in Sudan “because Americans are not required to register” with the US State Department, said the US has been in touch with American citizens on the ground to provide “consular services, other services, advice.” “We do know of course the number of Americans who have registered with us, and with whom we’re in very active touch, communication. Of those, I would say some dozens have expressed an interest in leaving,” Blinken said at a news conference at the State Department. “In just the last 36 hours since the embassy evacuation was completed, we’ve continued to be in close communication with US citizens and individuals affiliated with the US government to provide assistance and facilitate available departure routes for those seeking to move to safety via land, air and sea,” said Blinken, noting that included American citizens “traveling overland in the UN convoy from Khartoum to Port Sudan.” “We’re also deploying naval assets to Port Sudan in the Red Sea in case Americans who get out to Port Sudan want to be transported elsewhere or need any kind of care,” he added. Sullivan said the US has “deployed US intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets to support land evacuation routes, which Americans are using, and we’re moving naval assets within the region to provide support.” “American citizens have begun arriving in Port Sudan and we are helping to facilitate their onward travel,” he said. Officials told congressional staffers last week that there could be an estimated 16,000 American citizens in Sudan, most of whom are dual nationals. Both Blinken and Kirby echoed this on Monday and suggested that many of those dual nationals “don’t want to leave” the country. “We think the vast majority of these American citizens in Sudan, and they’re not all in Khartoum, are dual nationals – these are people who grew up in Sudan, who have families, their work, their businesses there, who don’t want to leave,” he said. In the days leading up to the evacuation, officials in Washington and the US Embassy in Khartoum repeatedly stressed that they did not envision carrying out a government-coordinated evacuation of American citizens due to the lack of an operational airport and the ongoing fighting on the ground. Still, there are worries about how to get Americans who wish to depart out of Sudan safely, especially now that the US does not have a diplomatic presence there. Although the US State Department warned US citizens against traveling to Sudan, some Americans with loved ones in the country suggested that the government had not done enough to advise Americans already in the country to leave. Some countries have already successfully carried out evacuations, including Spain, Jordan, Italy, France, Denmark and Germany, while the United Kingdom has evacuated embassy staff. Several of their convoys also carried citizens from other countries. Saudi Arabia evacuated 10 Saudi nationals and 189 foreigners including Americans from Sudan, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Twitter Monday. More evacuations are still being planned or are underway for the countries like China and India. There is immense concern about the safety of those who still remain in the country, regardless of their nationality, given the ongoing violence and its impact on critical resources like food, water and medical care. Internet connectivity has also been unreliable, leaving family members and friends outside of Sudan to worry if their loved ones are safe. The US government typically does not facilitate evacuations for regular citizens, and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan presented a rare – and chaotic – exception to that norm. Although the Biden administration has sought to avoid comparisons to that event, “Kabul casts a very long shadow over Khartoum,” in the words of one former official. Rebecca Winter, whose sister and 18-month-old niece are in Sudan, told CNN that they are in an “awful holding pattern” because her sister “has been told by both the US embassy and the international school that she works for that she has to shelter in place, and that she should not accept any offers for private evacuation.” “So she is just stuck waiting right now in fear,” she said. Although the US State Department warned Americans against traveling to Sudan, Winter said that according to her sister, “US employees there were not asked to leave the country.” Fatima Elsheikh, whose two brothers are in Sudan, also pushed back on the claim that US citizens who were already on the ground were warned before the outbreak of violence. “It makes me upset, because there was no warning. I don’t, I think it’s being painted as a country that’s been war-torn for a while, which isn’t true. This is unprecedented, what’s happening,” she said. The State Department travel advisory for Sudan prior to the outbreak of violence did not specifically tell Americans already in the country to leave, but advised them to “have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance” and “have a personal emergency action plan that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.” Blinken said Monday that the effort to assist Americans will “be an ongoing process.” He said the US is looking at resuming its diplomatic presence in Sudan, including in Port Sudan, but “that’s going to be entirely dependent on the conditions in Sudan.” Kirby said Monday morning that the violence in Sudan “is increasing,” and urged Americans remaining in the country to shelter in place. “It’s more dangerous today than it was just yesterday, the day before, and so, the best advice we can give to those Americans who did not abide by our warnings to leave Sudan and not to travel to Sudan is to stay sheltered in place,” Kirby said. Blinken said that “some of the convoys that have tried to move people out” of Khartoum “have encountered problems, including robbery, looting, that kind of thing,” but did not specify whether those convoys were carrying US citizens.

      Biden team works to finalize reelection plans as polls show tepid support for a 2024 bid
    ","President Joe Biden’s advisers are moving quickly to finalize staffing and operational details of his reelection campaign ahead of what’s widely expected to be a bruising 19-month effort to convince the public of his accomplishments and his ability to serve well into his eighties. Biden returned to the White House late Sunday from a weekend at Camp David designed to serve as an intensive runthrough of campaign and personnel planning, including matters still requiring his final approval, people familiar with the matter said. But even as officials made final edits to an announcement video likely to be released Tuesday, marking four years since Biden declared himself a candidate in the 2020 presidential election, the challenges of the upcoming contest were coming into sharper view. An NBC News poll released Sunday found just 26% of Americans think Biden should run for a second term as president, while 70% say he should not. Among Democrats, 51% say Biden should not run for a second term. That mirrors the findings of other recent polls showing tepid support for a Biden reelection bid, including an AP-NORC poll released Friday and CNN polling released earlier this month. In the NBC poll, nearly half of those who oppose a Biden run say that his age is a major reason for that view. Advisers are confident those numbers will mean little in the long run. Republicans – and former President Donald Trump’s candidacy in particular – have “a pretty good track record of bringing our people back home – and out to vote,” one senior Democratic official close to the White House said. Biden’s advisers also believe his age represents decades of experience, which they say has driven legislative wins delivering tangible economic dividends across the country. “He is a steady hand, when you look at what’s out there right now with Donald Trump and what we’re hearing again. People don’t want that chaos back again,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, when asked by CNN’s Dana Bash about Biden’s age on “State of the Union.” Still, at 80, Biden’s age is certain to act as a central issue in the coming campaign, a fact even many of his Democratic allies privately acknowledge. News that Biden had decided to launch his reelection campaign this week came as a surprise to a slew of Democratic officials who had been led to believe in recent weeks that Biden was more likely to wait until the summer to announce his bid. For weeks, Biden advisers and others close to the White House had insisted the president felt no pressure to announce this spring and was keen to allow an increasingly contentious Republican primary to play out without being in the mix as an official candidate. But other factors also weighed on Biden’s advisers. A messy debt ceiling fight, anticipated this summer, would not be the ideal time to announce a reelection campaign. The president will travel abroad next month for summits in Japan and Australia, and he plans to travel overseas again in July for a NATO summit in Lithuania, squeezing the calendar. And high-dollar fundraising tends to be slower during the summer months, which could affect Democratic officials’ desire to deliver a strong first quarter haul for the reelection campaign. Advisers continued to caution that last-minute changes were possible. And while Biden has finished taping a video declaring his candidacy and outlining his argument for a second term, according to people familiar with the matter, aides warned the timing of its release could shift. As planning for the reelection launch came into public view in recent days, the number of candidates for campaign manager rapidly narrowed from more than a half-dozen to one name. Biden is poised to name Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a senior White House adviser, to oversee the campaign, two senior Democratic advisers told CNN on Sunday. The choice of campaign chief was among the many outstanding decisions Biden and his team were making as they prepare for the potentially imminent announcement. Rodriguez, a senior adviser to the president and director of the White House’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, has seen her star rise in Biden’s White House. Biden elevated Rodriguez to the role of senior adviser last summer, adding her to the small circle of his senior-most aides. While Rodriguez will formally manage the campaign, the effort will also be largely guided from the West Wing, where top aides Anita Dunn, Jen O’Malley Dillon, Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti will also play central roles. Rodriguez, the granddaughter of labor icon Cesar Chavez, has been a longtime Democratic adviser who is close to Biden. CBS News was first to report the expected decision. Biden will name Quentin Fulks, who ran Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock’s successful 2022 race, as his deputy campaign manager, according to two people briefed on the matter. Biden’s final weekend before the expected announcement served as a window into the balancing act to come as he and his top national security officials navigated the complexity of a potentially perilous evacuation of government personnel from the US embassy in war-ravaged Sudan. Biden has maintained privately that his primary focus is on carrying the duties of the job he was elected to do in 2020. He gave the order on Saturday to deploy roughly 100 US special operations troops to secure and complete the evacuation of US personnel in Sudan. The operation was successful and no US military and diplomatic personnel were harmed in the roughly hour-long process. It served as a real-time demonstration of how the next 19 months may unfold for the incumbent running for the White House, where there are no shortage of crises that can turn a message or campaign on its head seemingly overnight. It also provided a window into another Biden reality, people familiar with the matter said. He will have the ultimate say in the direction of things, even if that say takes longer than some in the party would prefer. That drove some on Biden’s team to warn allies that the Tuesday announcement wasn’t locked in until Biden gave the green light. The video had been filmed, they noted, and close advisers had accelerated their communications with party officials and donors in the lead up to the announcement. But Biden wasn’t pleased by leaks – and still had much to mull over and discuss about the shape of his nascent campaign over the course of the weekend.

      US military kicked Iranian hackers off municipal website reporting unofficial election results in 2020
    ","Iranian hackers accessed a US municipal website for reporting unofficial election results in 2020 but were kicked off the network by US military hackers and didn’t have any impact on voting, a top US general said Monday. There was never a risk that vote counts could have been altered because such election night websites report preliminary data rather than certified ballot results. Instead, US officials were concerned that the hackers might use their access to the website to mislead the public by posting fake results. “Our concern is always that some type of web defacement … on the night of the election could make it look like the vote had been tampered with when that’s absolutely not true,” Maj. Gen. William Hartman, head of US Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force, said at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco. Cyber Command – the military’s offensive and defensive hacking unit – discovered the Iranian intrusion during a mission in foreign cyberspace, Hartman said. The US military then executed its own cyber operation to kick the Iranians off of the network of the US city to ensure the Iranian hackers were “unable to come back into the network” in the runup to the 2020 election, Hartman said. He did not name the US city network that was affected. The episode illustrates how cyberspace has become a key frontier in various governments’ efforts to shape, influence and defend elections. Since 2016, when alleged Russian military intelligence agents hacked and leaked the emails of the Democratic National Committee in a bid to sow chaos in the US election, US military hackers have grown much more evolved in defending election infrastructure. Hartman’s comments provide additional insight to what the US government has previously said about foreign interference efforts in the 2020 election. Broad Russian and Iranian hacking campaigns against multiple sectors “did compromise the security of several networks that managed some election functions,” the departments of Homeland Security and Justice said in a 2021 report, “but they did not materially affect the integrity of voter data, the ability to vote, the tabulation of votes, or the timely transmission of election results.” ",357,politics,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/iran-hackers-municipal-website-2020-election/index.html

      Sister of Paul Whelan attends UN Security Council meeting chaired by Lavrov
    ","Elizabeth Whelan – the sister of Paul Whelan, an American who has been detained in Russia for more than four years – attended the UN Security Council meeting that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov chaired on Monday. “I am here to tell Russia: free Paul Whelan,” Elizabeth Whelan said in remarks prior to the meeting. Lavrov arrived to address the international body as Russia continues its brutal invasion of Ukraine, and less than a month after Russia detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The US State Department has designated both Gershkovich and Whelan as wrongfully detained. Russia, which holds the presidency of the Security Council this month, scheduled the meeting to highlight the principles of the UN charter. Each month the Security Council’s presidency rotates among the 15 members. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield has described Russia’s Security Council presidency this month as “an April Fool’s joke.” She said the US would move to push back on Russia seeking to use its presidency to spread disinformation. In her remarks at the meeting, Thomas-Greenfield specifically referenced Elizabeth Whelan’s presence in the room. “I want Minister Lavrov to look into her eyes and see her suffering. I want you to see what it’s like to miss your brother for four years. To know he is locked up, in a Russian penal colony, simply because you want to use him for your own means,” she said. Lavrov, Whelan said, had looked at her when the US ambassador acknowledged her at the Monday meeting. “He and his group looked over towards me,” Whelan told CNN. “I expected him to shuffle papers.” Thomas-Greenfield, in an interview later Monday night with CNN’s Erin Burnett, said she was “pleased” Whelan saw Lavrov look at her “so that he could feel her pain and he can feel her suffering, not having seen her brother for nearly four years.” She added that “we’re doing everything possible, Erin, to get all American citizens — to get Evan, to get Paul — released from the terror that they are experiencing being in these penal colony colonies.” Speaking ahead of Monday’s meeting, Whelan had said that her brother “has not committed a crime, but a crime has been committed against him.” She was joined by Thomas-Greenfield, as well as the Irish and Canadian ambassadors to the UN. Paul Whelan has US, Irish, Canadian and British citizenship. “Paul was a corporate security director. He had a job he loved, a home, a life of hope and opportunity. All that has been taken away from him by Russia, a country that revels in its culture of lies, its tradition of hostage diplomacy,” Whelan said. “I am here today to tell the global community that one way to engage in effective multilateralism is to confront those countries that resort to hostage diplomacy,” she added. Thomas-Greenfield said in her remarks prior to the meeting that it was “impossible to ignore the giant elephant in the room: Russia.” “Russia, the convener of today’s meeting, invaded its neighbors in Ukraine and struck at the heart of the UN Charter. And Russia, time and time again, has violated universal human rights and fundamental freedoms both outside and inside its own borders – that includes arbitrarily detaining political activists, journalists and opposition leaders as well as the wrongful detention of American citizens,” she said. “There’s a human cost to Russia’s violation of international norms, to its barbaric practice of using people as political pawns. That cost is borne by those detained but also by their family and friends as Paul’s sister here with me today can attest to,” Thomas-Greenfield said. Elizabeth Whelan told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “The Lead with Jake Tapper” Monday that “it was quite a moment” to be in the room with the people who are imprisoning her brother. “I was there for Paul, and for Evan, and for Brittney (Griner), and for Trevor Reed, even those people who have been freed already, because this regime has gone too far,” she said. “This hostage diplomacy has to end.” The US government was unable to secure Whelan’s release last year when it brought home two other Americans who had been wrongfully detained in Russia – Reed in April and Griner in December. And earlier this month, Thomas-Greenfield spoke with her Russian counterpart at the UN to express the US demand that Gershkovich be released immediately. Whelan has urged the Biden administration to do more to free her brother. “Paul Whelan deserves better than he is getting for results. He has the White House attention to his case and now he needs the White House to get the job done,” she said in a video posted to Facebook earlier this month. Whelan also said that her family has “repeatedly seen the US government talk about lines beyond which they will not go to bring Paul Whelan back to Michigan.” But she said that such lines had been “erased” to bring Reed and Griner home. As tensions continue to rise between Russia and the US, Lavrov and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have no plans to meet on the sidelines of Monday’s meeting, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Sunday, according to RIA, a Russian state-owned domestic news agency. “There are no such plans. By and large, we do not have an agenda with the Americans for discussion at the ministerial level at the moment,” the deputy minister told reporters, according to RIA’s reporting. This story has been updated with additional developments. ",918,politics,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/paul-whelan-sister-un-security-council-lavrov/index.html

      Senate GOP campaign committee chair endorses Trump
    ","Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, endorsed former President Donald Trump Monday night. “The best four years I’ve had in the US Senate is when President Trump was serving in the Oval Office,” Daines told Donald Trump Jr. on Trump’s Rumble show, “Triggered.” “You talk about results – we passed and he signed the greatest tax cut in American history. We transformed the courts – the Supreme Court, the circuit courts. … We had a country that was respected and strong,” said Daines, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.” As head of the NRSC, Daines’ job is to help Republicans win the Senate in 2024. The party, which currently holds a narrow 51-49 majority, must defend 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs this cycle. That means Republicans need a net gain of just one or two seats to retake the Senate, depending on which party wins the White House in 2024. One source close to the Trump campaign described the endorsement as not only a political win, but a financial win as well. In his role, Daines has access to a vast network of wealthy Republican donors, many of whom have attempted to distance themselves from the former president this cycle. There is a hope, according to this source, that Daines’ endorsement could help boost Trump’s fundraising. After the 2022 midterms, when there was some consternation among GOP leaders over Trump’s backing of untested candidates, the NRSC under Daines has taken a much more hands-on approach to primaries, actively working on candidate recruitment and vetting. As CNN previously reported, the NRSC is weighing whether to spend big bucks in primaries to help root out weaker candidates, a move that risks setting up a clash with hard-right candidates aligning themselves with Trump. The GOP’s best pick-up opportunities lie in three states Trump won where Democratic senators are up for reelection next year, including Daines’ home state of Montana. Privately, Daines has spoken multiple times with Trump and has been in touch with his eldest son. The goal, GOP sources told CNN earlier this month, is to keep Trump aligned with Republican leadership – even as the former president has furiously attacked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the aftermath of the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, and as the Senate GOP leader has stayed silent amid the former president’s indictment on 34 felony charges in New York. Daines, however, has been vocal in his defense of Trump. This story has been updated with additional information.

      ‘Tennessee Three’ meets with Biden to discuss gun control
    ","President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with three Democratic Tennessee lawmakers at the White House on Monday, after the trio faced expulsion votes over their act of protest advocating for gun control. In the Oval Office, Biden told the Tennessee lawmakers, “If you stand up for kids, you’re standing up our communities and democratic values.” The three Democrats – Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson – were each subject to an ouster vote by Tennessee Republican lawmakers earlier this month over their protest on the state House floor to advocate for gun control, where they used a bullhorn to address those in the room. The lawmakers’ act of protest and rare expulsions from the body’s Republican supermajority came days after a mass shooting at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead, including three 9-year-old students. Following the White House meeting, the lawmakers told reporters they discussed red flag laws, safe storage laws, an assault weapons ban and strengthening background checks during their time with the president. Pearson said the meeting focused on “the need to have more gun violence prevention” at the federal and state levels. In a resolution, state Republicans had accused the trio of “knowingly and intentionally” bringing “disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives” without being recognized to speak, CNN affiliate WSMV reported earlier this month. Jones and Pearson, who are Black, were forced out of the GOP-controlled legislature. Johnson, who is White, was not expelled. The expelled representatives called the expulsions undemocratic and racist. Jones and Pearson were each sent back to the Tennessee House on an interim basis after local boards in their constituencies voted to reappoint them. Biden on Monday called the Republican legislature’s actions “shocking,” “undemocratic” and “without any precedent.” He said that “nothing is guaranteed by Democracy,” and that “every generation has to fight for it.” “You all are doing just that,” the president added. In addition to talking with Biden about gun control, Jones told reporters that the lawmakers discussed how they want to “build out multiracial democracy and challenge these extreme voices.” In an interview with CNN on Sunday, the lawmakers – dubbed the “Tennessee Three” – told CNN’s Abby Phillip that they planned to ask Biden to declare a public health emergency on gun violence. “I think that we need an emergency response because we’re facing a crisis situation … we need the help from our national leaders because we’re in a state where the only action that our colleagues took in response to the mass shooting in Nashville was to expel the two youngest Black lawmakers and then to pass a law to protect gun manufacturers,” Jones told CNN. It’s a big ask for Biden, who has previously said he’s exhausted all the avenues at his disposal as president to stop gun violence. Biden, whose party no longer controls both chambers of Congress, has urged members on Capitol Hill to act. But after the Nashville shooting, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Washington were quick to concede that Congress was unlikely to move on substantive gun control efforts. The president has taken more than 20 executive actions on guns since taking office, including regulating the use of “ghost guns” and sales of stabilizing braces that effectively turn pistols into rifles. He also signed a bipartisan bill in 2022 which expands background checks and provides federal funding for so-called red flag laws – although it failed to ban any weapons and fell far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for. The Tennessee trio all spoke to Biden during the expulsion vote earlier this month. In that conversation, Biden “thanked them for their leadership in seeking to ban assault weapons,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said after the conversation. Harris traveled to Nashville earlier this month to advocate for stricter gun control measures and also privately met with Jones, Pearson and Johnson. While Biden is expected to announce his 2024 reelection campaign as soon as Tuesday, Pearson noted to reporters that it did not come up during their meeting. Instead, he said, “we talked about resurrection of a movement around commonsense gun laws, we talked about this resurgence of hope in a state that is challenging these extreme special interests.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

      Trump’s GOP rivals struggle to break through as former president cements frontrunner status
    ","The question put to South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, hours after he announced plans to run for the Republican presidential nomination, was a simple one: How do you plan to defeat Donald Trump? Scott spoke for nearly a minute, discussing his mother, his belief in the power of prayer and his “faith in God and faith in our future.” When Fox and Friends co-host Steve Doocy lightly pressed for a more direct answer, Scott shook him off again. “As opposed to trying to have a conversation about how to beat a Republican,” he said, “I think we’re better off having a conversation about beating Joe Biden.” Scott, like his fellow GOP presidential contenders, is itching to take on the Democratic president, who is now poised to officially launch his reelection bid. But their first challenge will be getting through the Republican primary – and unseating Trump as the party’s standard bearer. Even with Trump facing a historic indictment and ongoing questions about his perpetuation of election lies, his challengers are still deeply reluctant to take on the former president, who sits atop almost every poll of the field despite numerous legal issues and the widespread rejection of his chosen candidates in the 2022 midterms. Trump picked up a key endorsement on Monday from the head of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm. Whether it’s a fear of alienating his core supporters or taking a social media drubbing, this new class of candidates – some officially in, others plotting their entry – has been careful in their remarks about Trump, largely steering clear of sharp criticism in favor of the occasional implicit jab, the kind that often fails to register with the average voter, or subtle indications of opposing policy views. “It’d be virtually impossible for somebody to break through in a constructive way at this stage,” said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist and veteran of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign. Conant said most 2024 primary voters have not yet tuned in and Trump is soaking up the relatively scant media attention on the race. Trump’s lesser-known rivals, he added, need to use the coming months to introduce themselves to voters and make favorable first impressions before they risk alienating Republican voters by taking on the still-popular former president. “To beat Trump, you have to either be a really good counter-puncher, or successfully ride the bubble. And neither of those things are easy,” Conant said. “Nobody has ever proven to be a good counter-puncher to Trump, and Biden’s the only one who’s ever really rode the bubble.” Unlike in 2015 and 2016, when he was a political unknown, Trump now has a lengthy track record in office for opponents to exploit: His four years as president; his failed efforts to challenge the outcome of the 2020 election; his supporters’ attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021; and mounting legal troubles, including his indictment in New York City over a hush money scheme and other looming challenges. Still, there has been almost no attempt to use his record against him, whether by invoking the Republican congressional majorities lost on his watch, his defeat in 2020, or the election denial movement that sparked a deadly riot at the Capitol and a crop of unelectable, extremist candidates in 2022. Leading Republicans have almost unanimously surmised that there is no avenue for parlaying those events against Trump in a primary campaign. “It’s shaping up to be 2016 all over again,” said Jason Roe, a Michigan Republican strategist and former executive director of the state GOP. Trump has “been able to suck up all the oxygen, and he’s doing it sooner in the cycle than he did eight years ago. It also looks a lot like ’16 with the number of candidates that are making noise about running.” In the early stages of the campaign, Trump’s rivals have mostly tried to execute bespoke campaign strategies under the former president’s exceptionally sensitive radar. Roe said it might be wise for expected 2024 candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to wait to enter the race, ideally limiting their exposure and hoping Trump “racks up a few more problems and starts to look like a liability.” Trump’s seemingly inevitable cratering, though, was what his 2016 rivals waited for – and it never came. Now a former president, Trump might be facing different challenges this time around, but his appeal remains unique. Few candidates see their fundraising totals spike after being indicted, as he did this month. And with no example of a rival who benefited from launching a full frontal attack on him, this year’s rivals are reluctant to leave their trenches. Another Republican strategist, who worked for a rival campaign in 2016 and has spoken with others this year, agreed that candidates were wise to delay their confrontations with Trump but warned against relying on outdated practices when the time came. “A candidate has to understand that that is what it’s like running against Donald Trump,” the strategist told CNN. “The age of having carefully controlled media appearances and a moderate approach to content creation – that is not going to work against Trump, who, whether he wants to make news or somebody else wants to make news about him, it happens every single day. It happens constantly. And the only way to occupy attention in a voter’s mind is to fight him for that space.” DeSantis, considered Trump’s top competition, has been at the front of the line among high profile Republicans in trying to win over conservatives angered by progressive-minded cultural and business trends. He routinely slams DEI – or “diversity, equity and inclusion” – programs at colleges and in corporations in his bid to appeal to GOP right-wingers who previously backed Trump. DeSantis also needled the former president shortly before Trump’s indictment by a New York City prosecutor over hush money payments to a porn actress, telling reporters in Florida, “I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair – I just, I can’t speak to that.” But DeSantis, like so many others either in or considering a primary run, effectively defended Trump by attacking the Democratic prosecutor and echoed Trump in casting the case as a witch hunt. “The weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. It is un-American,” DeSantis tweeted. Former Vice President Mike Pence, another potential primary candidate, has gone further than most in condemning Trump’s actions before and during the January 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol. At an event last month in Washington, Pence – whose life was threatened by violent Trump supporters after he refused not to certify the 2020 presidential election results – issued his most stark criticism of his former running mate to date. “What happened (on January 6) was a disgrace, and it mocks decency to portray it in any other way,” Pence said. “President Trump was wrong.” But Pence’s harsh words typically stop there. Just a few weeks after giving those remarks, he was among those defending Trump over his indictment. Describing the decision as “an outrage,” Pence argued that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was politically motivated. After CNN’s Wolf Blitzer pointed out that a grand jury voted to charge Trump, Pence doubled down. “When you have an attorney general in New York, a Manhattan DA, that targeted one particular American in their campaigns, I think that offends the notion of the overwhelming majority of the American people who believe in fairness, who believe in equal treatment before the law,” Pence said. David Kochel, a veteran Iowa Republican strategist, urged caution in assessing the 2024 race – and expressed some optimism that the past was not destined to repeat itself. “I think it’ll be a much smaller field than 2016, and I also think that probably a few of the campaigns will get out earlier, because I think everybody is aware that the dynamic of 2016 is a losing dynamic when you’ve got somebody who’s famous with as fixed a base as Trump has,” he said. Potential candidates like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan recently ruled out runs, but the field is still expected to grow. Scott, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are already in. DeSantis and Pence are nearly sure bets to join them and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie looks increasingly likely to try his luck. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu is also weighing his options. DeSantis is widely considered the best bet among that group to outlast Trump in a one-on-one competition. But in a repeat of the traditions of 2016, that title has made him a target for attacks from others lower down the perceived pecking order. Christie, Sununu and Hutchinson have all rapped DeSantis over his feud with Disney, arguing that it undermines Republicans and the conservative message. “I think that’s not a conservative position. I think he’s wrong and I think rightfully makes a lot of people question his judgment and his maturity,” said Christie, who famously roasted Rubio on the debate stage in 2016 before bowing out and endorsing Trump, in a recent interview with Semafor. Trump joined the pile-on against DeSantis, saying on his social media website Truth Social that the Florida governor was being “absolutely destroyed” by Disney. DeSantis has been clashing with Disney since last year, when the state passed a new law that limited classroom instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity and Disney objected to the bill. “His original P.R. plan fizzled, so now he’s going back with a new one in order to save face,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Disney’s next move will be the announcement that no more money will be invested in Florida because of the Governor - In fact, they could even announce a slow withdrawal or sale of certain properties, or the whole thing. Watch! That would be a killer. In the meantime, this is all so unnecessary, a political STUNT! Ron should work on the squatter MESS!” Establishment Republicans wary of Trump’s viability in a general election, if not his politics, have also revived another old, failed tactic in trying to keep the former president onside: the “loyalty pledge.” The subject protracted strife in 2016, and the party is now, as it did then, seeking to get promises from the primary candidates that they will support the eventual nominee, whoever it is. Trump signed the oath in September 2015, after some back-and-forth, but disavowed it the next spring, as the 2016 contest entered its final stages. At a CNN town hall that March, Anderson Cooper asked Trump whether he would stick by his pledge. “No, I don’t anymore,” Trump said. “No, we’ll see who it is.” Flash forward to 2023, and a similar dynamic appears to be unfolding. In February, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash she thought using a signed loyalty pledge as the price of admission to the debate stage was a “no-brainer.” In response, a Trump campaign spokesperson told CNN, “President Trump will support the Republican nominee because it will be him.” Weeks earlier, Trump demurred when asked if he’d consider backing anyone but himself for president, telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, “It would have to depend on who the nominee was.” Hutchinson, in an interview with Bash after McDaniel floated the pledge, questioned the idea, noting that it was clear for all to see that “the motivation (behind a pledge) is to keep Donald Trump, if he doesn’t win the primary, from running as a third party candidate.” He then, perhaps inadvertently, spelled out why the 2024 version of the pledge would be doomed from the start. “We did (have loyalty oaths) in 2016, they weren’t effective, they weren’t enforceable,” Hutchinson said. “You had candidates who participated in the debate who later didn’t support the nominee of the party.” That nominee, of course, was Trump.

      Jordan subpoenas FBI human resources official
    ","House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan has issued a subpoena to Jennifer Leigh Moore, executive assistant director of human resources at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, demanding she answer questions from the select subcommittee on the so-called weaponization of the federal government. Russell Dye, Jordan’s spokesperson, claimed in a statement that Moore “refused to answer questions” about the FBI’s alleged retaliation against conservatives during a transcribed interview with the panel that took place on Monday. The newly issued subpoena demands Moore return for closed-door questioning under oath on May 10. “Executive Assistant Director Moore voluntarily answered questions from members and their staffs about the FBI’s security clearance adjudication process for several hours,” the FBI said in a statement Monday, noting that “She did not discuss the details of specific individuals whose cases are still under review to protect the integrity of the process and the privacy of the individuals.” The bureau “remains fully committed to cooperating with Congress’ oversight requests consistent with its constitutional and statutory responsibilities,” the statement said. Jordan and his fellow Republicans say they have heard from “whistleblowers” who disclosed that the FBI is attempting to “purge” employees with conservative views. In a September letter to Moore, Jordan claimed that the committee had received information suggesting Moore “retaliated against at least one whistleblower” who had made protected disclosures to Congress, and that other whistleblowers had alleged Moore was involved with revoking the employees’ security clearances. “We have received protected whistleblower disclosures that the FBI is engaging in a ‘purge’ of employees with conservative views by revoking their security clearances and indefinitely suspending these employees. Many of the formal notices for these adverse personnel actions have been signed by you,” the Ohio Republican, wrote at the time. Monday’s subpoena, however, does not offer details about the FBI employees’ specific complaints about the bureau’s leadership. It marks the latest effort by Republicans on the subcommittee to investigate alleged abuse and misconduct with the FBI. Last month, Jordan sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting interviews with 16 bureau employees who he said could speak to the panel’s claims that the agency is “weaponized” against conservatives. Jordan has also claimed he has been in communication with “dozens” of federal government whistleblowers who he asserts have shared stories of discrimination and bias. But Democrats have raised questions about their legitimacy as whistleblowers and the relevance of their testimony. This story has been updated with additional information.

      Scam PAC operator uncovered by CNN’s KFile sentenced to 10 years in federal prison
    ","A scam PAC operator was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison Monday after pleading guilty to wire fraud and money laundering for operating a scheme to collect more than $3 million from donors during the 2016 election. Matthew Tunstall, 36, was one of three men who ran two political action committees during the 2016 campaign cycle that tricked unsuspecting donors into giving them money by using robocalls and written solicitations meant to imply they were supporting presidential candidates. But the money raised in the name of supporting the 2016 presidential candidates – both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton – were actually used to enrich themselves and pay for more robocalls and radio advertisements, according to the Department of Justice and previous KFile reporting. In Tunstall’s sentencing memo filed earlier this week, his lawyers asked that Tunstall serve 24 months of home confinement and three years of supervised release. Prosecutors asked for 188 to 235 months, or more than 15 years to 19-and-a-half years. CNN has reached out to Tunstall’s lawyer for comment. KFile reported extensively on Tunstall and the PAC’s activities, first in 2016 at BuzzFeed and later in 2017 at CNN. A 2021 investigation of Tunstall revealed that he was living in Los Angeles under the assumed name of “Matte Nox” while operating two different scam PACs. Under the Nox alias, Tunstall flaunted a lavish lifestyle online as a wannabe influencer, frequently posting photos of luxury jewelry and accessories, his Porsche Panamera and partying at nightclubs with models. Since the landmark Supreme Court ruling Citizens United in 2010, which allowed for corporations and special interest groups to engage in unlimited amounts of campaign spending, campaign spending has incubated a marketplace where billions of dollars can be spent on a single campaign cycle. Campaign spending remains largely unfettered today, creating a system ripe for abuse for operators like Tunstall. Federal prosecutions of scam PACs are rare: fewer than a handful of cases are prosecuted each year and only the most egregious ones are prosecuted, according to campaign experts who spoke with CNN.

      Election 2024: A consequential rematch of serial candidates
    ","This could be the most consequential rematch in US history – a president who portrays himself as the champion of democracy against a former president who routinely rejects election results. Anyone fearing Donald Trump’s return and those who reject Joe Biden’s victory could agree that nothing less than the future of the republic is at stake if Biden and Trump are on the ballot in 2024. So why does it feel like an unwanted movie sequel - same actors, predictable new plot twist? Biden will have been a candidate on the national stage in five of the last ten presidential elections. His first and second presidential campaigns sputtered in Democratic primaries in 1988 and 2008. He ran as Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008 and 2012. After sitting out 2016, Biden returned on a mission to unseat Trump in 2020. Now the oldest-ever president, he’ll be asking voters to put him in the White House until after his 86th birthday. Trump is already on his third straight election campaign. And let’s not forget he teased runs in 1988, when Biden launched his first failed bid, and also in 2000, when Trump left the GOP for a time, and in 2012, when he led the charge questioning, incorrectly, Obama’s citizenship. Candidates who run three or more times don’t often successfully become president. One successful example is Ronald Reagan, who like Biden and Trump was technically a senior citizen when he took office. Reagan won his first term on his third try. He also overcame underwater first term approval ratings to win reelection. In fact, at this point, a little over two years into their presidencies, Biden, Trump and Reagan were all hovering around 40% approval, according to data maintained by Gallup. Both Biden and Trump are, for now, primed to stay on top for their parties. CNN’s Harry Enten looks at polling data to argue this could be the most “boring” presidential primary season ever. It’ll be boring not because it’s inconsequential, but because it currently lacks much excitement. Enten notes that Biden has not yet drawn a serious challenger and Trump has routinely enjoyed a sizable lead over declared and likely challengers. Explaining the current strength of Trump’s position in the GOP field, Enten points at national and early primary state polling and Trump’s growing quiver of endorsements: ENTEN: For an example of someone polling like Trump is now and then losing the party nomination, you have to look at primaries involving an incumbent. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary to President Jimmy Carter, despite easily leading him in polling at this point in the cycle. … This time around, Trump already has over 60 endorsements from governors and members of Congress. Since 1980, candidates with comparable collections of gubernatorial and congressional endorsements at this point in the cycle have all gone on to win their parties’ nominations. Those endorsements include a majority of the House delegation from Florida, Trump’s adoptive home state and also home to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has not officially launched a presidential campaign but is generally regarded as Trump’s top competition. During a trip to Japan, DeSantis was asked about polls that show him trailing Trump. “Well, I am not a candidate, so we’ll see if and when that changes,” DeSantis told reporters. This is the dichotomy of US politics. Biden and Trump are in positions of strength in their respective primaries at the same time they generate very little excitement for the public at large. Less than 40% of registered voters even say Biden deserves reelection in CNN polling from March. That means more than 60% of registered voters said he does not deserve reelection. It would be an extremely troubling figure for Biden supporters if Trump did not inspire equal frustration for a large portion of the country. While a small majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said in in March they would prefer the Democratic Party to nominate someone other than Biden in 2024, Biden has actually improved quite a bit on this question. Last summer it was three quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters who were hoping for an alternative. In the meantime, Democrats outperformed expectations and kept control of the US Senate after November’s midterm election. It’s also worth noting that most people who said they wanted to see a Biden alternative did not have a specific idea about who that alternative should be. Trump, unlike Biden, does face serious challengers for the GOP primary. DeSantis has benefited from a large amount of media attention, but still consistently trails Trump in primary polling. CNN’s Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg write about the difficulty Republican candidates have faced gaining traction against Trump despite his legal problems and his potential weakness in a general election campaign. From their report: Whether it’s a fear of alienating his core supporters or taking a social media drubbing, this new class of candidates – some officially in, others plotting their entry – has been careful in their remarks about Trump, largely steering clear of sharp criticism in favor of the occasional implicit jab, the kind that often fails to register with the average voter, or subtle indications of opposing policy views. An exception to that rule of Republicans treading carefully around Trump is former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. “The reruns will be worse than the original show was,” Christie said of a Trump primary nomination during an appearance in New Hampshire last week. Trump has also gained ground in recent serveys. Fewer than 40% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters wanted to see Trump nominated back in CNN’s December poll. By March, a slim majority in CNN’s poll said Trump should get the nod. A more recent poll published Monday, from NBC News, suggests Trump’s indictment on criminal charges by the Manhattan DA doesn’t appear to have hurt him among Republicans. Among those who say they would vote in the Republican presidential primary next year, 46% say they would back Trump out of a list of seven possible candidates, 31% choose DeSantis, and 6% former Vice President Mike Pence. All other candidates tested were at 3% or less. Winning a nomination is a far different thing than winning the presidential election, however. And majorities of Americans aren’t happy with either man – 60% of the population say in the NBC poll that Trump should not run. An even larger portion, 70%, say Biden should not run. Thus, the latest edition of a presidential election featuring Biden or Trump, will frustrate most of the country even as it is shaping up to be the most likely possible scenario.

      McCarthy’s authority is on the line as debt ceiling crisis mounts
    ","House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will put his shaky control of the thin Republican majority on the line this week with a bid to pass a bill slashing spending that is designed to jam President Joe Biden over the looming government debt crisis. The standoff is deepening between the Republican speaker and the Democratic president, which could be fateful for the country and both their political careers. And the ability of each side to unify their parties and shape public opinion to avoid – or dispense – blame will be crucial. The clash is over the need to raise the government’s borrowing authority within months, without which the United States will default on its debts in a way that could send the domestic and global economies spiraling and could inflict deep pain and job losses on Americans. Republicans are seeking to use the situation as leverage to gut Biden’s domestic program. The president, as he moves toward making his reelection campaign official as early as this week, says the GOP must not hold the nation hostage to what he says is an extreme agenda. The debt ceiling showdown is important to Biden as he seeks to protect the legislative achievements of his term so far and to portray an image of strength and purpose. He’s been building toward a reelection pitch partly by portraying House Republicans as the epitome of the chaos and disruption of ex-President Donald Trump, who is leading polls of the GOP primary. McCarthy is seeking to unite his party around him to pass a bill that would raise the debt ceiling for a year in exchange for deep spending cuts. The measure would limit growth in government spending to 1% a year, block student loan forgiveness, rescind new funding for the Internal Revenue Service, introduce tougher work requirements for Medicaid, and repeal green energy tax credits in an effort to strangle Biden’s attempts to create a low-carbon economy to fight climate change. A source involved in the effort told CNN’s Manu Raju Monday that the speaker’s whip team had been working all weekend to secure the 218 votes needed for passage and were confident they would win the critical vote later this week. But some stumbling blocks remain on details of the Medicaid and energy tax break issues. Even if it makes it out of the House, the measure has no chance of defusing the situation or of winning the battle for the GOP since it won’t pass in the Democratic-led Senate. The approach is meant to make it look to the public like Biden is being obstructive and should hold the blame for any debt default. The White House has said it won’t negotiate over a debt ceiling increase – which is Congress’ responsibility – and will only accept a clean proposal to raise the nation’s borrowing limit. The speaker, however, on Sunday was adamant that Biden would have to climb down from that position as the country races closer to a crisis that could peak sometime this summer. “We will hold a vote this week, and we will pass it, and we will send it to the Senate,” McCarthy said on Fox, claiming Republicans were the only party in Washington with a responsible plan to raise the debt limit and criticizing Biden’s refusal to negotiate. “He needs to show leadership and come to the negotiating table, instead of put us in default. This is risky, what he’s doing. He’s threatening the markets,” the California Republican asserted. But the speaker left himself little political breathing room. There remain huge questions over whether McCarthy, presiding over a tiny majority that’s beset by ideological divides, can unite his troops behind his effort. And if he can’t pass even this preliminary messaging bill, his authority will be in tatters. Some Republicans are demanding spending cuts that would be politically impossible for Biden to agree to. Others may refuse to vote to raise the debt ceiling whatever happens. More moderate Republicans worry about the extreme factions of their party as they contemplate reelection bids. McCarthy, meanwhile, would likely pay with his job if he were forced to use Democratic votes to raise the debt ceiling – currently at over $31 trillion. This could set up a direct clash between McCarthy’s personal ambition and the national interest. There are risks for Biden, too. A prolonged crisis caused by the failure to lift the debt ceiling and the potential of tumbling stock markets would leave him deeply vulnerable as he enters a reelection race. The speaker’s position ignores the fact that most Republicans had no problem raising the debt limit with no conditions when Trump was in the White House. It also doesn’t take into account the fact that the debt ceiling needs to be raised to pay for obligations already authorized by Congress – including under Republican presidents. But if he is able to pass a bill, he could in theory build political pressure and increase jitters among some Democrats who fear the consequences of Biden being portrayed as the recalcitrant figure in the showdown – even if, at this point, the White House feels he has the moral high ground. The first signs emerged late last week of some skittishness among a few Democrats about a showdown that appears to be heading for a dangerous cliff edge. Much will depend on how the president is able to frame the narrative around the standoff. The reality is that Democrats’ loss of the House last fall leaves the White House no choice but to negotiate with Republicans on spending and means Biden no longer has the freedom of being able to effectively dictate terms on the budget. But at the same time, he wants to protect what he has already achieved – for instance, green energy legislation that was critical to establishing the US global role in fighting global warming. And if Republicans are able to use the debt ceiling to secure huge concessions, Biden will have cooperated in establishing a ruinous precedent. The GOP would no doubt seek to use exactly the same weapon to destroy his domestic agenda next year in the run-up to the election. And the prospect of endless brinkmanship over raising borrowing limits would severely damage the economy’s reputation as a financial haven and the stellar US credit rating. The problem, however, is how the White House explains its stance to the public. Democrats are portraying McCarthy and the GOP conference as a radical tool of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement, which is willing to burn the country down for political gain. They are also sticking to the position that Biden is happy to talk spending with Republicans but only in relation to the budget process that controls future spending and not in relation to the debt ceiling, which needs to be raised to pay for existing obligations. This is a complicated distinction, however, that McCarthy is doing his best to blur even as leading Democrats hammered out the party line on Sunday. “Let me put an idea out there. The proposal that McCarthy has put forward, that belongs in the budget,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Our main goal right now is to make clear that we are going to avoid default. The last time when this was in the air, we literally went down in our credit rating back in 2011. What we will see, the repercussions of this are huge, if you go forward as McCarthy wants.” Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin also stressed that Biden was willing to talk – but only on the budget and not the debt ceiling. “If we default on our national debt, it’s going to cost our economy dearly. We’re going to find businesses unable to proceed and people losing their jobs right and left. That is a terrible outcome. So let’s do the responsible thing and not default, move forward on the debt ceiling,” the Illinois Democrat said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Durbin, like almost everyone on the Democratic and Republican sides, repeatedly stressed the danger of default. But at this point, it’s unclear how such a disastrous outcome can be avoided. At the very least, it will take deft political management from both Biden and McCarthy – and would require trust between the two most powerful people in Washington that doesn’t seem to exist. The capital’s polarization and the political pressures on each man also make it hard to see room for a compromise that would satisfy both sides. And the crisis keeps on building, relentlessly, every day. ",1431,politics,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/kevin-mccarthy-debt-ceiling-crisis/index.html

      Why 2024 could be the most boring presidential primary season ever
    ","For people who write about electoral, or “horse race,” politics, few things are more enjoyable than an exciting presidential primary season. Sometimes, both Democrats and Republicans cooperate by holding gripping fights for the party nods (see 2008). Sometimes, however, voters in both parties quickly coalesce around front-runners (see 2000). A look at the current dynamics in both parties suggests 2024 could be one of the most, if not the most, boring primary cycles in the last 50 years. Nothing is set in stone. Things can change when you least expect it, but it’s tough not to acknowledge the current facts. Let’s start on the Democratic side, where President Joe Biden is expected to announce as early as Tuesday that he is running for reelection. No incumbent president has lost a state primary (where he was on the ballot) since 1980. At this point, Biden doesn’t look likely to break that streak. He hasn’t attracted a challenger who would be considered serious under most metrics. Neither Marianne Williamson nor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ever held elected office. Williamson gained no traction during her 2020 presidential bid. Kennedy pushes debunked conspiracy theories about vaccine safety and is seeking votes from an electorate that is overwhelmingly vaccinated against Covid-19. The very limited polling so far shows Biden with a large advantage over Williamson and Kennedy. Perhaps more importantly, few Democratic elected officials have indicated anything other than loyalty to a 2024 Biden bid. That’s key for a few reasons. First, primary endorsements are as good a predictor at this point of primary success as polling is. Second, it’s true that Democratic primary voters tell pollsters they are open to listening to a credible challenger to Biden. The president, after all, would be 82 years old at the start of a potential second term. But as Billy Preston once sang, “Nothin’ from nothin’ leaves nothin’.” That polling hypothetical means nothing if no one with a base within the party runs. Biden’s strong approval rating among Democrats is well in line with that of previous incumbents who cruised to renomination. So it’s not like Democratic voters will be kicking and screaming if they have to support Biden for another term. On the Republican side, former President Donald Trump finds himself in his best position in a very long time to win the GOP nomination. I’m unaware of a single recent reliable national or early-voting-state-level poll that shows Trump with anything other than a “big league” edge over both declared and potential 2024 opponents. He’s regularly at around 50% in national surveys. This 50% is key because it’s so rare for someone to be polling at that level at this early juncture and not win the nomination. Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000, Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 were the sole candidates running in incumbent-free primaries who were near, at or above 50% in early national polling. All four of them were able to secure the nominations with relative ease, and Clinton was the only one who lost more than a handful of primary contests. For an example of someone polling like Trump is now and then losing the party nomination, you have to look at primaries involving an incumbent. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary to President Jimmy Carter, despite easily leading him in polling at this point in the cycle. It’s possible that since Trump is the first former president to actively seek a presidential nomination in over 80 years, the early national polling means less than it normally does. That said, Trump has more going for him than national polling. For one thing, his early-state-level polling looks as good as it has in a while. A University of New Hampshire poll released last week puts him up 20 points on Ron DeSantis in a hypothetical Granite State GOP primary, after he trailed the Florida governor by 12 points in January. This polling is supported by something that eluded Trump when he first ran for the presidency in 2015: endorsements from elected officials. Trump didn’t get his first one from a governor or member of Congress until after winning his first primary contest during the 2016 cycle. This time around, Trump already has over 60 endorsements from governors and members of Congress. Since 1980, candidates with comparable collections of gubernatorial and congressional endorsements at this point in the cycle have all gone on to win their parties’ nominations. Most impressive is what Trump has done in Florida. DeSantis would be Trump’s most serious challenger by far if he decides to run. He’s the only one breaking into double digits in the average national and early-state polling. Yet Trump has gone into Florida and already secured endorsements from a majority of Republicans in the state’s US House delegation. Some of those endorsements aren’t surprising (e.g., Rep. Matt Gaetz). Some of them are notable, such as Rep. Byron Donalds, who introduced DeSantis at his 2022 reelection victory party. Trump, like Biden, seems to have two things going for him: a large share of Republican voters and the party behind him. If those two were in opposition to each other, the primary season would have looked far more interesting. So unless something changes, we’re looking at a recipe for primary success for both the current president and the man he succeeded.

      We are already in the food fight portion of the GOP primary
    ","The 2024 Republican presidential primary is not fully underway as yet and already we are in the food fight phase. A super PAC supporting former President Donald Trump tried to smear Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis with pudding, seizing on a report, which the governor denies, about his eating habits to make a point about Social Security and Medicare. The ad itself is gross. And it drew a super PAC supporting DeSantis off the sidelines to air an ad of its own wondering why Trump was going after the Florida governor. For the record, neither DeSantis nor Trump currently say they will touch safety net benefits, but both have a past of suggesting they could. I talked to CNN chief national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny by email about the Trump/DeSantis dynamic, the role of deep-pocketed super PACs and what else is going on in this nascent primary campaign. WOLF: We are nine months away from the first primaries and not all of the top candidates have even declared their candidacies. But there’s some super PAC mudslinging. What’s happening and what do we need to take from all of this? ZELENY: A new season of attack ads has begun, with allies of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis firing some of the first direct shots of the young presidential campaign. Now is the time to define your opponent – whether you’re an announced candidate (Trump) or expected to be one soon (DeSantis) – and begin pointing out potential vulnerabilities. Not surprisingly, the opening volley was about Social Security and Medicare and highlighting old comments about promising to reform the entitlement programs. WOLF: Super PACs can’t technically coordinate with campaigns. DeSantis doesn’t technically have a campaign. How is that working exactly? ZELENY: The Florida governor isn’t planning on jumping into the presidential race until May or June – after the legislative session is over – so until then, a group of deep-pocketed allies are coming to his defense. The super PAC, which is called Never Back Down, is effectively a campaign in waiting, complete with pollsters and political strategists of all varieties. Federal election law prohibits coordinating with the campaign, but when there isn’t an official campaign, that formality becomes far easier. WOLF: Do other Republican candidates have deep pocketed super PACs? Who are the other players to watch? ZELENY: Not nearly as deep, no, but most major Republican candidates have at least some type of super PAC assistance. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has some support – and is seeking more – as are other potential candidates. One likely presidential contender, Sen. Tim Scott, has one financial advantage that makes him stand apart from his rivals: He has more than $20 million left over in his campaign account from last year’s Senate race, which he can use on his presidential race. That’s a head start most of his rivals can only dream of. WOLF: Trump and DeSantis have been shadowboxing around each other for some time. Can we assume this is a prelude to a much more bruising fight in the making? What does this say about GOP unity heading into the primaries? Zeleny: GOP unity? That will come later – or that’s the hope of top Republican officials – but the bruising season of define-your-opponent is underway. The Trump-DeSantis feud has long been simmering, but their springtime exchanges are almost certainly quaint, compared to what’s likely to come. WOLF: What do we know about where these super PAC ads are running? Are they focused on specific types of voters or is this simply an effort to get attention from us in the media? ZELENY: For now, most of the ads are running on cable television and sports. The Make America Great Again group, which supports Trump, has been running ads for weeks now seeking to define DeSantis in a negative light. You have likely seen some of these, which begin with the ominous: “Think you know Ron DeSantis? Think again.” WOLF: Are there any changes in how you think super PACs will operate this year and how they’ll be involved in the campaign? ZELENY: With every passing election cycle, super PACs play a more prominent role. It’s easier to raise money – without the federal limits imposed upon candidates. If the early months of the year are any indication, the 2024 campaign will push the limits even more, with outside groups far more important than political parties or, in some cases, even the candidates themselves. WOLF: Are there any early conclusions we can draw about how Trump’s indictment by the Manhattan DA on criminal charges has affected his campaign? Has it impacted his popularity among Republican voters? Affected his fundraising? ZELENY: Early conclusions are often risky ones, but the Trump campaign insists the indictment has been a fundraising boost. It certainly has rallied many Republicans around him – or at least unified them in opposition to the indictment – but it may be far too soon to say whether this will continue to be the case. He faces potential criminal action in Georgia, for his role in trying to overturn the election results, as well as at least two federal investigations.

      Supreme Court faces Friday deadline in case that could shape abortion access and the future of American health care
    ","A deadline looms at midnight Friday for the most critical abortion case before the Supreme Court since its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last summer. The future of a widely used medication drug to end pregnancies is the specific issue before the court. But nothing less than the health care options of American women and even the viability of US regulatory approvals for routine drugs are in question. Justice Samuel Alito earlier this week granted the high court more time to consider a ruling by a Texas judge that would block approval of mifepristone and to extend a temporary hold on a subsequent appeals court ruling, which would let the government’s approval of the drug stand but agreed access could be limited. The extension for the Supreme Court’s impending order is until 11:59 p.m. ET Friday, and until then, the drug remains available. But the precarious waiting period has been a study in microcosm of the deep uncertainty about the continued availability of abortion in some states nearly a year after the court’s conservative majority overturned the constitutional right to the procedure. It reflects the way that the post-Roe anti-abortion movement has escalated its effort to eradicate abortion rights everywhere. The current case also shows that President Joe Biden’s administration is ready to intervene aggressively in the courts to try to protect abortion rights. The fallout from the Texas ruling, which blocked Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug, is also thrusting abortion back into the Washington political storm in a way that has been a liability for the Republican Party with more moderate and swing voters – an ironic consequence of conservatives’ decadeslong campaign against Roe. There’s another irony to this all-consuming legal collision. Alito wrote in his majority opinion overturning Roe last summer that the 1973 decision was wrong because justices had usurped the Constitution and taken away from lawmakers the duty of deciding matters related to abortion rights. But the power play by the Trump-appointed Texas judge in this case, which swiftly rose to the high court, shows that Alito and his colleagues are going to be embroiled in deciding abortion law for years to come. As with most things about the Supreme Court, the reasoning behind Alito’s extension of the temporary hold was unclear to outsiders. He could simply have been providing his colleagues more time to consider an extraordinarily complex legal and clinical issue. Or it may be that there is no current majority on the bench for any course of action. The court is considering both the ruling by District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to halt the approval of mifepristone and a 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the FDA’s certification of the drug to stand but limited its use. The Supreme Court might uphold either ruling, reject them, cobble together a middle path or extend the stay on Kacsmaryk’s ruling pending litigation in what could be a fateful case. There is also an order contradictory to Kacsmaryk’s, from a judge in Washington state, requiring the FDA to keep mifepristone available in 18 liberal jurisdictions, which is further adding to the legal imbroglio. Former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers said on “CNN News Central” on Wednesday that the fact that the court didn’t order a longer stay than the current two days could mean justices “are seriously thinking about affirming some of what the Fifth Circuit said.” “If they agree with the Fifth Circuit as to which parts of Judge Kacsmaryk’s (order) could survive or could be rejected, it would mean that women would have to go in person, multiple times, to their doctor and could only get mifepristone up to seven weeks (into a pregnancy),” Rodgers said. The decisions that the justices could make will have wide-ranging implications beyond the simple question of if and when mifepristone can be used. — The Supreme Court could potentially deliver a ruling that would effectively allow a single judge – in this case, in a red corner of Texas – to influence the medical choices and restrict the freedoms of millions of American women, not just in states where abortion is banned but also in more liberal areas where it is legal. “This was an unelected judge making a decision – a federal decision basically on this,” GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina told CNN’s Manu Raju on Wednesday. This sweeping use of judicial power not only appears to offend the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling last year on allowing legislators to decide abortion rights. The ruling by Kacsmaryk, a long-time opponent of abortion rights, exemplifies the ambition of parts of the anti-abortion rights movement in the post-Roe era. But it could also open the way for liberal judges to use their power in the same way, and create a thicket of litigation that could also end up at the Supreme Court. The judiciary’s nominal reputation for restraint and staying out of partisan politics is already being threatened. — The Supreme Court’s eventual ruling could also have a sweeping impact on how mifepristone is prescribed – often as part of a two-drug regimen to end pregnancies and after miscarriages – and, in some cases, on the availability of abortion services to millions of women. As with the aftermath of the repeal of Roe v. Wade, the justices’ ruling here could mean that women’s rights and freedoms to make their own health care decisions could be more curtailed in some states than others. Katie Watson, an associate professor at Northwestern University, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that even a partial loss of access could have grave consequences. “Approximately a half million women used this drug in recent years and they depend on it,” she said. — Critics argue that if Kacsmaryk’s ruling is upheld – along with the Fifth Circuit’s limitations on the use of mifepristone – it would validate a decision of a single judge or panel with no medical expertise over standards of science and clinical analysis. Mifepristone has been safely prescribed since the FDA approved it two decades ago. But anti-abortion doctors and medical associations argued in the case that the agency violated the law in how it approved the drug for abortions in 2000. By filing their suit in Amarillo, Texas, they guaranteed that Kacsmaryk would hear the case. “They basically have said, these two judges, hey we know better than the FDA,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar told Tapper. Such a precedent could create chaos in the pharmaceutical industry and in medicine and threaten the regulatory system for clearing new treatments. It might also prompt other judges to take aim at approved drugs – for instance, birth control pills or even treatments for common ailments and pain killers. Such a scenario would directly undermine the entire premise of federal government. “The impact, even if they say the Washington order can stand and the Texas order can stand, is that the FDA cannot regulate federally. … The impact is enormous,” Watson said. — The justices’ deliberations may also have a profound effect on the reputation of the court. Many moderate Americans increasingly see the conservative majority as a group of unelected right-wingers flouting public opinion on issues like abortion, which majorities do not want to be banned outright, according to many polls. While the conservative justices insist that they are simply interpreting the Constitution as written and returning issues to the states, a decision that causes massive upheaval could harm the court’s image at a time when it is also reeling from ethics questions surrounding conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. — A decision to ban mifepristone could cause shockwaves like those set off by the overturning of Roe, which hurt Republicans in last year’s midterm elections and most recently galvanized voters in support of a liberal candidate in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race earlier this month. Advocates who believe abortion is immoral may not care about partisan implications. The repeal of a constitutional right to an abortion validated a half-century-long campaign by the anti-abortion movement in one of the most significant political victories in modern American history. But the Republican Party risks paying a price in next year’s presidential and congressional elections. Liberals might have been complacent in a belief that Roe would never be overturned, but they have effectively leveraged the issue ever since. “Our Republican colleagues, for the most part, have been silent on this,” said Klobuchar, referring to the cases currently being considered by the Supreme Court. “We are standing up, the Democratic Party, President Biden, for women’s rights, to say women have a right to make their own health care decisions.” Mace, the South Carolina Republican from a competitive district, delivered a warning on Wednesday that the GOP’s position could cost it the House majority in 2024. “It’s a purple district, and as a bellwether for the rest of the country, it’s one of the reasons why we will not win the popular vote in ’24 if we continue down this path of extremism,” Mace said of her Charleston-area seat. “That is not where the American people are, and we need to have a conversation, where are we and where is the middle ground?” The Supreme Court’s deliberations come as abortion is already at the center of federal, local and state government policy debates and is stretching the court system with dueling rulings that are further politicizing the legal system. In the six months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, there were about 32,000 fewer abortions than expected in the US, according to a new study by the Society of Family Planning. And CNN reported Wednesday that fewer medical students are applying to ob/gyn residency programs, with the decline most marked in states with the strongest restrictions. And a patchwork of laws related to abortion, and its restricted access, is emerging across the country. On Wednesday, for instance, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed new bills that he said will enshrine a “culture of life” by widening a safety net for foster children and expanding adoptions and resources for women who discover they are pregnant. Last week, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill outlawing most abortions in the state after six weeks – a point by which many women do not know they are pregnant. The potential presidential candidate’s reluctance to publicize his move, which was announced late at night, reflected the tug of war in the GOP between the desire to go all in on banning abortion and a recognition that doing so could alienate more moderate voters in a national election.

      Heat rises on Biden as Democratic squeamishness over debt showdown emerges
    ","The risks and pressures of a coming debt showdown with Republicans are quickly mounting for President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce a reelection bid as soon as next week. Most attention so far has been on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s perilous effort to unite his fractious party and preserve his tiny majority. But the White House and top Democrats are insisting that they won’t engage with McCarthy’s demand for sweeping spending cuts in exchange for the House agreeing to lift the government’s borrowing limit to avert a disastrous debt default and a possible financial crisis this summer. The administration’s logic is that if hostage takers get concessions they will just demand more. But the first signs of skittishness are emerging among some Democrats on Capitol Hill in a worrying sign for the administration ahead of tense weeks that could define Biden’s domestic legacy and decide whether McCarthy can keep his slender grip on power. Several House Democrats on Thursday expressed the hope that the president would negotiate with McCarthy. Their concerns appeared to undermine Biden’s position and raised new questions about how long his reluctance to bargain can be sustained. “I think Joe Biden should be talking to Kevin McCarthy, even if those conversations right now prove nothing productive,” Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a freshman Florida Democrat, told CNN’s Manu Raju. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell warned: “We have to get this figured out,” adding, “The United States cannot default.” Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who’s up for reelection in deep-red West Virginia next year and is no stranger to breaking with the White House, called out “a deficiency of leadership” while praising McCarthy for offering a proposal. But such comments are unlikely to immediately shift what appeared to be a hardening White House position on Thursday. And Biden got a firm endorsement of his approach from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who insisted that the debt ceiling must be raised with no concessions, warning, “No brinkmanship, no hostage taking. Clean. Clean. Clean.” The New York Democrat’s role in bolstering Biden’s approach will be crucial. But signs of concern among other party members do raise the possibility that the White House has work to do to shore up support for its stand among allies on Capitol Hill. The first signs of a shift in the politics of the debt ceiling fight come as both the White House and McCarthy seek to prime public opinion for a collision on an issue that might seem bewildering to voters but that could have the nation racing toward a crisis before long. Since the government takes in less money in revenue than it spends, it needs to borrow money to meet its obligations. But it has reached the previous limit authorized by Congress, at over $31 trillion, and only Congress can raise that ceiling. For most of modern history, this hasn’t been an issue, but Republicans – who have previously voted to raise the limit under GOP administrations – now want to leverage this moment to try to kill off Biden’s agenda. Both sides are essentially laying the same bet in this game of Russian roulette with the US economy. The assumption is that the consequences of a default would be so disastrous that the other side will eventually be forced to blink to avoid taking the blame. Biden appears to have the political and moral high ground at the outset of the clash because only Congress has the capacity to expand the government’s ability to borrow money to pay for spending that it has already authorized. The White House also appears to have calculated that McCarthy will never be able to unite his party. And even if Biden did decide to horse trade positions and programs with the speaker, there’s no guarantee that McCarthy could pass anything given the radical nature of his conference. The White House also argues that since the debt limit needs to be raised to pay for past spending – including by ex-President Donald Trump – the House has a moral obligation to act. The speaker has tried to counter these two liabilities by increasing his demands for Biden to negotiate – including with a trip to Wall Street this week – and by portraying the president as unreasonable and obstinate, while fashioning a bill raising the debt ceiling in exchange for huge spending cuts. In order to win this confrontation – assuming he can bring his party with him – McCarthy needs to shift the blame equation to the president. The California Republican has beseeched his party to get behind a bill as a way of forcing Biden to the negotiating table. But the measure is purely tactical since it’s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate. There is not even any guarantee McCarthy, who can only afford to lose four votes, can corral House lawmakers on the left or the right of his party to get behind it. Further down the road, fears of a default are being exacerbated by real doubts that he could sell any possible concession he could get out of Biden to a conference that sees compromise as surrender. Biden says he’s happy to talk – in the framework of budget talks with Republicans – but cannot offer concessions until Republicans stop risking the financial wellbeing of millions of Americans who could see market-linked savings tumble and job losses in the event of a default. And the White House is taking aim at aspects of McCarthy’s plan, arguing that it will punish less affluent Americans, while sparing the rich, and could kill a manufacturing rebound in the heartland. The potential weakness in the president’s approach lies in the intricacy of the issue. While his position makes sense to those well versed in congressional procedure, it will be much harder to sell to the public, which may not realize raising the debt ceiling is Congress’ burden. The distinction between a debt ceiling negotiation and budget talks may seem semantic to many Americans, and the risk for Biden is that voters view both sides as equally dysfunctional. Politically, Biden cannot afford to be seen as caving to Republicans – both in order to preserve the authority of his presidency and to send a signal of strength as he is expected to launch his reelection bid. Biden’s small circle of close-knit advisers and allies are preparing for a video announcement Tuesday that would coincide with the anniversary of his campaign announcement in 2019, CNN reported Thursday, citing four sources familiar. But there are also signs of an evolving White House strategy. The administration is pairing its insistence that Republicans are taking unreasonable risks with the economy for political reasons with increasing attacks on the details of McCarthy’s plan. “We cannot hold America’s full faith and credit hostage,” Mitch Landrieu, a White House senior adviser responsible for implementing Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday. “The debt ceiling is not something to be trifled with.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday sought to align Biden with middle-class Americans when she described items in McCarthy’s plan, which includes new work requirements for Medicaid, as “cruel.” “We saw what Speaker McCarthy and the MAGA wing of the Republican Party put forth,” she said, arguing it would “really harm American families who are struggling every day to make ends meet.” “The president has been very clear. … Show me your budget and I’ll show you what you value. We have seen what the Republicans in Congress, in the House specifically, along with the speaker, Speaker McCarthy, values.” ",1263,politics,2023-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/politics/biden-debt-ceiling-democratic-squeamishness/index.html

      What’s going on with all the wrong-place wrong-time shootings?
    ","Wrong doorbell. Wrong driveway. Wrong car. In all three cases, a man opened fire rather than ask a simple question: “Do you mean to be here?” This is not a story about mass shootings, AR-15s, or really even about gun laws. At least not yet. It’s about a country with more guns than people, where whatever inspires the 30% of Americans, who are most likely to be men, who own firearms has converged in dangerous and deadly ways with whatever fear, frustration or paranoia leads someone to shoot at a stranger or a car that’s driving away. These three shootings happened in less than a week around the country: ► In Kansas City, Missouri on April 13, two shots were fired at Ralph Yarl, a Black teen trying to pick up his brothers just before 10 p.m. By some miracle, he survived after being shot in the head. ► In rural upstate New York on April 15, two shots were fired from a porch at cars full of young people that had just turned around after looking for a party in the wrong driveway. Again, just before 10 p.m. Twenty year-old Kaylin Gillis was killed by the bullet that struck the car driven by her boyfriend. ► Outside Austin, Texas, on April 18, two cheerleaders were shot in a grocery store parking lot just after midnight. One of the girls, Heather Roth, accidentally tried to get in the wrong vehicle. She and her teammate, Payton Washington, were both struck. Roth was treated at the scene and Washington is recovering in the ICU. All three shootings occurred after dark. All three shooters have been accused of serious crimes. There have already been stories about whether any of these cases might fall under so-called “stand your ground” laws that allow armed Americans in most states to defend their so-called “castle.” Related: What to know about stand your ground laws We’ll leave it to the judicial process to determine how exactly Yarl, a 5’8” aspiring chemical engineer; a vehicle driving away from a house in New York; or teenage girls in a parking lot could possibly represent a deadly threat. What may tie them all together is that the shooters don’t appear to have been interested in looking for answers. Yarl and Andrew Lester, the 84-year-old homeowner accused of opening fire, both told police that Lester almost immediately shot Yarl upon opening his front door. Yarl, wounded, ran to multiple houses asking for someone to call 911. In upstate New York, 65-year-old Kevin Monahan, who has shown no remorse, according to the local sheriff, fired shots from his porch at two cars and a motor cycle that were driving away. “As soon as we figured out that we were at the wrong location, we started to leave, and that’s when everything happened,” Gillis’ boyfriend, Blake Walsh, told NBC. “My friend said, ‘They’re shooting — go!’ I tried to step on the gas as fast as I could, and that’s when the fatal shot (that struck Gillis) came through,” he said. The suspect in Austin, Pedro Tello Rodriguez Jr., 25, is also said to have simply opened fire. “I see the guy get out of the passenger door, and I rolled my window down, and I was trying to apologize to him,” Roth said, according to CNN’s report. “And then halfway, my window was down, and he just threw his hands up, and then he pulled out a gun and he just started shooting at all of us.” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said on “CNN This Morning” that he feels that the behavior from Lester – who was released on bail – makes him a “threat to the public.” “I don’t know what house he’s in right now. I don’t know if that’s a house that the next Amazon driver or postal worker or campaign worker may knock on the door for,” Lucas said. “And then what? And then what does somebody have to worry about?” He also pointed out he has spent time with the Liberian community in Kansas City since the shooting and many of them have sought out primarily White neighborhoods. (Yarl’s parents are Liberian immigrants, according to The New York Times.) Lucas described the community as “hard-working people who moved to Kansas City, many of whom have moved to neighborhoods like this one for the best opportunities for their children, knowing that they are majority White, but thinking that it is worthwhile in a way because there could be this great education, you wouldn’t deal with these sorts of challenges,” Lucas said. What we know about why Lester shot Yarl is what he has told police. Awoken by his doorbell, Lester said he was, “‘scared to death’ due to male’s size and Lester’s age (84) and inability to defend himself,” according to police. Lucas doesn’t buy that, noting that Lester said Yarl was six feet tall, when he’s actually 5’8”. “I think that this has everything to do with race,” Lucas said. “The defendant’s fear of Black people, Black men, Black boys. I think that’s why we are all discussing this now. … I think that if the young man wasn’t Black, we wouldn’t be here today.” Each of these distinct cases will wind their way through the justice system. It could take a while. For example, another shooting outside Austin, in which a 65-year-old man, Terry Duane Turner, shot and killed Adil Dghoughi in his car as Dghoughi backed out of his driveway in 2021, has still not been resolved, according to local media reports. Turner did not speak with Dghougi, but said he felt threatened that Dghougi was parked next to his pickup truck in the early morning hours and has claimed the “stand your ground” law in Texas justified him killing Dghoughi. Reading about gun violence can make it seem like gun ownership is ubiquitous. There are about 120 guns for every 100 Americans, according to one estimate. But about half the nation’s privately owned guns are owned by a fraction of the US adult population, according to a 2017 report from Harvard and Northeastern universities. Related interactive: How US gun culture stacks up with the world About three in 10 adults say they own a gun and four in 10 say they live in a household with a gun, according a 2017 Pew Research Center Survey cited by CNN’s Harmeet Kaur last year. But there are certain groups that are much more likely to own a gun. Nearly half of White men, compared to less than a quarter of White women and non-White men, said they owned a gun in the Pew survey. Just 16% of women of color said they owned a gun. There are also the expected partisan divides. Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to own a gun. People in rural areas are much more likely than city dwellers to own a gun. Why people buy guns can be complicated. Kaur writes: People own guns for a number of purposes, and most gun owners say they own a gun for more than one reason. Protection is a motivator for a vast majority of people. A Gallup survey conducted in October 2021 found that 88% of gun owners counted protection against crime as a reason for owning a gun, while 70% counted target shooting and 56% counted hunting as reasons. Similarly, Pew found that two-thirds of gun owners cited protection as a major reason for owning a gun, while about four in 10 cited hunting and three in 10 cited sport shooting as major reasons. About three-quarters of gun owners see firearms as key to their freedoms, while about half see them as important to their identities, according to Pew. A more recent KFF survey offered some additionally important insights. That survey also found about four in 10 Americans live in a house with a gun. Among these, more than half said the gun is stored in the same location as ammunition and more than a third said the gun is stored loaded. That’s another thing that appears to tie these recent shootings together – loaded guns at the ready. And no questions asked.

      The $787 million check that Fox must cut won’t restore damage to US democracy
    ","Fox News will pay $787.5 million for transmitting lies that a small voting technology firm helped steal the 2020 election. But it’s impossible to put a price on damaged trust in US democracy. The last-minute deal Tuesday between the conservative channel and Dominion Voting Systems, halting a blockbuster jury trial, delivered a staggering financial settlement after a process that had already exposed Fox’s willingness to parrot election conspiracy theories that its executives and anchors knew weren’t true. The agreement delivered restitution to Dominion for the hits to its reputation, and repudiated false claims that its machines were used to simply flip vote totals from ex-President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden. It represented a huge victory for the firm’s lawyers and, in the context of a civil legal suit, the massive payoff validated the decision to bring the case. “This is really the first time that anyone has paid a price for telling the lies about the 2020 election and we are very proud about that,” Dominion’s lead lawyer, Justin Nelson, told CNN’s Alex Marquardt, arguing that the settlement secured accountability for the firm and solidified a shared vision of national facts vital to the survival of democracy. There have indeed been few consequences for the Trump lawyers and supporters who spouted falsehoods and nonsense about a fair election in 2020 that the ex-president lost, although some key figures and other right-wing networks face their own pending defamation suits from Dominion. Smartmatic, another voting technology company, is also suing Fox News for defamation in a case that’s pending. And Trump himself is facing several criminal probes related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the run-up to the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Dominion’s lawyers argued that they performed a valuable civic service by teasing out the truth of how Fox News operates and the way that its leaders feared that fact checking Trump’s claims would cause viewers to defect to other right-wing outlets. Much of this information came out in a flurry of pre-trial legal filings that got huge media coverage. But outside of the legal and financial context, does Nelson’s statement that this was a moment of public accountability really ring true, especially when Trump is continuing to make election falsehoods a central currency of his 2024 campaign? And is there any chance that Fox’s humiliation can repair some of the damage from the disastrous election aftermath in 2020? Will the settlement do anything to change a conservative media model that monetizes falsehoods? Fox News is set to pay a heavy financial price in the settlement, and its reputation took massive blows after it emerged that its anchors knew Trump’s claims were spurious. But those prime-time stars will not be required by the terms of the settlement to apologize on air. Ironically, the viewers whom they didn’t want to alienate by telling them the truth about the election may never know they were misled without the channel’s anchors having to admit it on TV. This is one reason why it’s unlikely that news of the massive payout will make much of a ripple in the conservative media bubble and among the millions of Trump voters who have embraced his lies about 2020. There is, therefore, very little hope that the settlement will do anything to puncture the alternative reality concocted by the ex-president that he was illegally ejected from office. And while the magnitude of Tuesday’s settlement might make conservative networks more cautious about defaming individual firms like Dominion, it’s unlikely they will ditch their lucrative business model. So while the outcome of this case carries important media and business consequences, it may not have much impact on future US elections. Fox’s statement Tuesday hinted that while the massive check it will cut to Dominion is effectively an admission of guilt and a stunning blow to its finances, the public spin around the judgment – and the way it will be filtered through the conservative media world – will be very heavily conditioned. “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” Fox said in a statement that fell well short of a public mea culpa. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement went on. Another way for the country to have been spared such acrimony would have been for no one to have made or amplified false voter fraud claims, which were initially spun by Trump and eventually helped lead to an unprecedented mob attack on Congress by his supporters. By settling before the trial, Fox avoided having the billionaire chair of Fox Corporation, Rupert Murdoch, top editors, and stars like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson being potentially called to testify under oath about its coverage of the election. For the conservative news channel’s opponents, that will be a lost cathartic opportunity to hold Fox’s leadership to account for their conduct. Even given the conservative bubble, such a spectacle would have been hard for Fox to hide. That missing moment of accountability will be important because claims that the 2020 election was corrupt are not some artifact of recent history. They are a corrosive and self-perpetuating reality two years on. Trump rarely misses a chance to refresh his lies about 2020 and he uses the perception that he was kicked out of office unfairly to fire up voters for his bid to regain the White House in 2024. Polls show large numbers of conservatives have lost faith in the electoral system and falsely believe that Biden did not win sufficient votes to win the presidency. A CNN/SSRS survey in July 2022 found that only 29% of Republicans had confidence that US elections truly represent the will of the people. The extent to which Trump’s falsehoods and conspiracy theories harmed democracy is open to debate. After all, the constitutional guardrails protecting the transfer of power did hold firm in Congress and in the courts despite the insurrection. When voters in swing states were presented with GOP nominees in the midterms who supported Trump’s lies, they were most often rejected in a manner that dampened Republican hopes of a red wave election. Yet the decline of democracy isn’t necessarily always visible. In nations where political freedoms have been eclipsed, a slow erosion of confidence in democratic institutions builds over time. Growing public distrust in the integrity of elections and judicial and political institutions has a damaging cumulative effect. So while the $787 million payment to Dominion can help repair the company’s own reputational loss, it will not wipe lies about 2020 out of public consciousness or reverse their impact among conservative voters. The damage is done. Still, some Washington veterans were more optimistic about the long-term impact of Tuesday’s settlement. Norm Eisen, a former White House special assistant for ethics and government reform, marveled at the size of the settlement, which he argued sent an unequivocal message. “It’s a gigantic number for a settlement of a case of this kind,” Eisen told CNN. “That sends a message, Fox has also had to acknowledge the false statements that they made. Even if Fox doesn’t report on this, it is such a big news story it is going to penetrate to every part of our country.” And Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer, said that “all settlements end up with a little bit of good and a little bit of disappointment.” He told told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the settlement was “really damaging to those who say the election was stolen. This was an important day potentially for restoring faith in American elections.” But Dominion’s lawyer, Nelson, acknowledged that despite delivering a statement about democracy, even a settlement worth three-quarters of a billion dollars could not repair the damage wrought by lies about the 2020 election. “I think it shows that we are not going to stop holding people accountable for these election lies, that to be clear, are continuing to cause tremendous damage to Dominion and to our country. There are a tons of people who still falsely believe it.” ",1361,politics,2023-04-19,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/politics/election-lies-fox-settlement/index.html

      Gaming the government is not going well
    ","Governing is not, or at least it shouldn’t be, some kind of game. But this week it feels like powerful people are treating it like one, running trick plays to score points, trash talking and making threats, and exploiting rules to bring things to a halt. In Florida, a brewing grudge match pits Disney, one of the state’s largest employers, against its governor, the ambitious Republican Ron DeSantis who is eyeing a presidential run. How the state government’s relationship with its notable corporate citizen turned petty is getting hard to follow. The basic storyline, as laid out by CNN’s Steve Contorno, is that Disney spoke out against a law DeSantis pushed to limit what teachers can say in the classroom. Faulting its “woke” corporate behavior, DeSantis and Republicans in the state moved to install their political allies onto a quasi-government board that oversees the area that includes Disney World. But the company moved to defang the board before the new appointees took on their roles. Rather than sending a message to Disney, DeSantis now looks outmaneuvered and is threatening more action against the company. It’s not clear if he’s serious or not, but the most bizarre idea he suggested is building a state prison on public land next to the Magic Kingdom. Watch him here. The appearance of a Republican potentially trying to sabotage a massive employer is the kind of play DeSantis’ potential rivals for the Republican presidential nomination are happy to point out. “I think it rightfully makes a lot of people question his judgment and his maturity,” former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday in a conversation with the website Semafor. Christie said if DeSantis “can’t see around a corner that (Disney CEO) Bob Iger created for you,” then “that’s not the guy I want sitting across from President Xi and negotiating our next agreement with China.” In Washington, where the Senate rulebook has been befuddling people for centuries, Republicans are citing the Senate rules and making clear they won’t let Democrats replace, even temporarily, the ailing Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Feinstein, 89, has been out of the office since early March while dealing with a case of the shingles. But since Democrats only have a one-seat majority on the panel, her absence has ground judicial nominations to a halt. For a rules-minded guy like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, another octogenarian just returning from his own month-plus convalescence after a fall, there’s no need to let Democrats get another vote on the committee and push through scores of nominations caught in limbo. McConnell suggested if Democrats culled the herd of nominees, they might get some confirmed. “They could move a number of less controversial nominees right now. Right now,” he said Tuesday on the Senate floor. “They want to sideline Senator Feinstein, so they can ram through the worst four as well.” Various Senate rules have been confusing people for centuries. Even if Feinstein were to resign, Sen. Mitt Romney suggested Tuesday that Republicans could block changes to the Senate Judiciary Committee. “I don’t think Republicans are going to lift a finger in any way to get more liberal judges appointed, so whether she’s resigned or leaves temporarily from the judiciary committee, I think we will slow walk any process that makes it easier to appoint more liberal judges,” Romney said. Feinstein’s absence isn’t the only problem, as CNN’s Tierney Sneed and Lauren Fox have pointed out, since Republican senators can also use the “blue slip” tradition to veto judicial nominees the Biden administration has put forward for their states. If the importance of judicial nominees is still in question, look no further than the furor that a Trump-appointed federal judge has caused by ruling to suspend the 23-year-old FDA authorization for mifepristone, the first drug used in a medication abortion. The decision by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk out of the federal court in Amarillo, Texas, has sent the abortion issue straight back to the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule by Wednesday in a case that could remove nationwide access to a medication that American women have been using for decades, even in states that have sought to protect abortion rights. Kacsmaryk was all but selected by opponents of the drug to hear the case since he is the only federal district judge in Amarillo. It’s not the rulebook, but rather the teamwork making House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s life difficult. He wanted to send a message of unity to Wall Street with a speech there Monday. His goal was to calm nerves about the looming debt ceiling showdown and project that Republicans have a plan to raise the debt ceiling and impose spending cuts. Their plan probably won’t get any support from Democrats. But almost on cue Tuesday, conservative Republicans began to poke holes in McCarthy’s plan, calling it into question as the US hurtles toward a potential default if there is no debt ceiling agreement by June. McCarthy, at least for now, seems disinclined to allow a vote on any proposal that could get support from Democrats in the House. And he seems unable to find a proposal that can get all Republicans on board. Those Senate rules make it impossible for anything to pass through that chamber without support from ten Republicans, so long as Feinstein is not voting. Read more from CNN’s Stephen Collinson. Suffice it to say the debt ceiling, the abortion medication and Disney’s status in Florida are issues where there’s not a winner and a loser, even if they’re being treated that way by the powerful people who are supposed to be in charge.

      The Tennessee expulsions reveal the core divide in US politics. Here’s why.
    ","Rarely have the tectonic plates of American politics collided as visibly and explosively as they did earlier this month in Tennessee. The procession of predominantly middle-aged or older White Republicans who rose almost two weeks ago in the Tennessee House of Representatives to castigate, and then expel, two young Black Democrats crystallized the overlapping generational and racial confrontation that underpins the competition between the political parties. The Republican vote to expel those Black Democratic representatives, Justin Pearson and Justin Jones, encapsulated in a single moment the struggle for control over America’s direction between the nation’s increasingly diverse younger generations and its mostly White older cohorts. While kids of color now comprise just over half of all Americans younger than 18, Whites still constitute about three-fourths of the nation’s seniors, according to Census data analyzed by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. That stark division – what Frey terms “the cultural generation gap” and I’ve called the competition between “the brown and the gray” – has become a central fault line in the nation’s politics. Particularly in the Donald Trump era, the Republican coalition has grown increasingly reliant on older Whites, while younger people of color are evolving into a critical component of the Democratic voting base. The priorities and values of these two giant cohorts often clash most explosively in red states across the South and Southwest, like Tennessee, where Republicans now control state government. In those states, Republicans are moving aggressively to lock into law the policy preferences of their older, predominantly White and largely non-urban and Christian electoral coalition. That agenda often collides directly with the views of younger generations on issues including abortion, LGBTQ rights, limits on classroom discussion of race, gender and sexual orientation, book bans, and gun control. Across the red states, the conditions are coalescing for years of escalating conflict between these divergent generations. From one direction, the Republicans controlling these states are applying increasingly hardball tactics to advance their policy agenda and entrench their electoral advantage. That strategy includes severe gerrymanders that dilute the influence of urban areas where younger voters often congregate, laws that create obstacles to registering and voting, and extreme legislative maneuvers such as the vote to expel Pearson and Jones. What Republicans in Tennessee and other red states “are trying to do is minimize the voices – minimize the sound, minimize the protest, and continue to oppress folks who do not agree,” says Antonio Arellano, vice president for communications at NextGen America, a group that organizes young people for liberal causes. From the other direction, the youngest Millennials and first representatives of Generation Z moving into elected office are throwing themselves more forcefully against these GOP fortifications – just as Jones and Pearson have done. These young, elected officials have been shaped by the past decade of heightened public protests, many of them led by young people, particularly around gun safety, climate change, and racial equity. And more of them are bringing that ethos of direct action into the political arena – as Jones and Pearson did by leading a gun control protest on the floor of the Tennessee legislature. “This generation of politicians have been socialized through the crucible of Black Lives Matter and the [Donald] Trump era and political polarization,” says Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta who studies race and politics. “So it’s not surprising that they are usually going to be confrontational.” In the red states, this rising wave of urgency and militancy among younger progressives is crashing headlong into the fortifications Republicans are erecting to solidify their control. Even with the ardor evident from Jones, Pearson and their supporters in Tennessee, most observers agree it will be very difficult any time soon for “the brown” to loosen the grip of “the gray” over political power in almost any of the red states. “In the short term there isn’t a risk” to the GOP’s hold on the red states, said Gillespie, “which is why you see these legislators flexing their power in the way they are.” And that could be a recipe for more tension in those places as the diverse younger generations constitute a growing share of the workforce and tax base, yet find their preferences systematically denied in the decisions of their state governments. Like many analysts, Melissa Deckman, chief executive officer of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, predicts that “what we saw in Tennessee was the first salvo” of escalating conflict as older white conservatives, especially in the red states, resist the demands for greater influence from the emerging younger generations. “An overwhelmingly White conservative legislature taking this remarkable and drastic step of expelling the two young African-Americans,” she says, “is a taste of what we are going to see in the future driven by those demographic changes.” Those demographic changes are rooted in the generational transition rumbling through American life. Though the tipping point has drawn little attention, Frey has calculated that a majority of the nation’s population has now been born after 1980. And those younger generations are kaleidoscopically more diverse than their older counterparts. The change is most visible on race. Because the US essentially shut off immigration between 1924 and 1965, nearly three-fourths of baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) are White, as are more than three-fourths of the remaining seniors from the older generations before them, according to Frey’s figures. By contrast, Frey has calculated, people of color comprise well over two-fifths of Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), just under half of Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2012) and slightly more than half the youngest generation born since 2012. That youngest generation (sometimes called Generation Alpha) will be the first in American history in which racial “minorities” constitute the majority. The transition extends to other dimensions of personal identity. The Public Religion Research Institute has calculated that while just 17% of Americans aged 65 or older and 20% of those aged 50-64 do not identify with any organized religion, the share of those “seculars” rises to 32% among those aged 30-49 and 38% among adults 18-29. In turn, while White Christians constitute about half of all adults aged 50-64 and three-fifths of seniors, they comprise only about one-third of those aged 30-49 and only one-fourth of the youngest adults. Gender identity and sexual orientation follow the same tracks. Gallup has found that while less than 3% of baby boomers and only 4% of Generation X (born 1965-1980) identify as LGBTQ, that figure jumps to nearly 11% among Millennials and fully 21% among Generation Z. In all these ways, says Deckman, who is writing a book on Gen Z, “you have a younger group of Americans who are more diverse, less religious, care passionately about the rights of marginalized groups, and are watching rights taken away that they thought would always be there.” Though the pace and intensity varies, these changes are affecting all corners of the country. Even in states where the GOP has consistently controlled most state offices such as Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina, the share of adults younger than 45 who are unaffiliated with any religion now equals or exceeds the share who are White Christians, according to detailed results PRRI provided to CNN. By contrast, in those states’ over-45 population, White Christians are at least twice, and often three times, as large a share of the population as seculars. Frey has found that in every state the youth population 18 and younger is now more racially diverse than the senior population 65 and older. From 2010 to 2020, in fact, every state except Utah and North Dakota (as well as Washington, DC) saw a decline in their total population of White kids younger than 18. Kids of color now comprise a majority of the youth population in 14 states and at least 40% in another dozen, Frey has found. States on that list include many of the places where Republicans have been most forcefully imposing a staunchly conservative social agenda. Kids of color already represent about half or more of the youth population in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Mississippi, South Carolina and Arizona and about two-fifths or more in several others, including Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas. In many of those states the share of seniors who are White is at least 20 percentage points higher than the share of young people. A similarly large “cultural generation gap” is also evident in many blue states, including Nevada, California, Colorado, Washington and Minnesota. The difference is that in states where Democrats are in control, the diverse younger generations are, however imperfectly, included in the political coalition setting state policy. Political analysts in both parties – from Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson to Democratic strategist Terrance Woodbury – point out that Democrats have their own problems with younger voters, who have never been enthusiastic about President Joe Biden, and are expressing disappointment that the party hasn’t made more progress on issues they care about. But in blue states the direction of policy on most key social issues, such as abortion, gun control and LGBTQ rights, aligns with the dominant views among younger generations. And in most blue states, Democrats have prioritized increasing youth turnout and, in many cases, reformed state election laws to ease registration and voting. But in the red states, younger voters, especially younger voters of color, are largely excluded from the ruling Republican coalitions, which revolve preponderantly around Whites, especially those who are older, Christian, non-college and non-urban. In 2022, for instance, 80% of younger non-white voters (aged 45 or less) voted against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia, 65% voted against GOP Gov. Greg Abbott in Texas, and 55% opposed Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida, according to exit poll results provided by Edison Research. Yet all three men won decisive reelections, in large part because each carried about seven-in-ten or more of Whites older than 45. In some ways, the generational tug of war between the brown and the gray symbolized by the Tennessee expulsions represents the classic collision between an irresistible force and an immovable object. In this case, the irresistible force is the growth in the electorate of the diverse younger generations. In 2020, for the first time, Millennials and Generation Z constituted as large a share of eligible voters nationwide as did the Baby Boom and its elders – though those older generations, because they turned out at much higher rates, still represented a larger percentage of actual voters. In 2024, Frey has projected, Millennials and Gen Z will comprise a significantly larger share of eligible voters than the boomers and their elders – enough that they will likely equal them as a share of actual voters. Already in several states, kids of color comprise a majority of those who turn 18 each year and become eligible to vote; Frey projects that will be true for the nation overall by 2024. The immovable object is the GOP control over the red states. That’s partly because of the changes in electoral rules Republicans have imposed that create obstacles to registration or voting, but also because of their dominance among older Whites and their inroads into culturally conservative Latino voters in some of these states, particularly Texas and Florida. Another challenge for Democrats is that youth turnout is often lowest in red states. Though youth turnout also lagged in some blue states including New York and Rhode Island, in an analysis released earlier this month the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University found that red states comprised all nine states where the smallest share of eligible adults aged 18-29 cast a ballot; Tennessee ranked the lowest of the states for which CIRCLE has data. Red states also have erected many of the most overt obstacles to youth participation. Eight Republican-controlled states, including Tennessee, Texas and recently Idaho, have sent a clearly discouraging signal to young voters by declaring that student IDs cannot be used as identification under state voter ID laws. A Texas Republican state legislator this year has proposed banning polling places on college campuses. Abby Kiesa, CIRCLE’s deputy director, says that in both blue and red states, laws and social customs act in reinforcing ways to either promote or discourage youth voting. “The infrastructure and the state laws” in states that encourage youth voting like Michigan, Oregon and Colorado “create a stronger culture of engagement,” she said. “Because more people are voting, it is more of a norm, people are talking about it more, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.” In states with pronounced barriers to voting, she notes, an opposite cycle of disengagement can take hold. The unlikelihood of overcoming the GOP’s red state electoral defenses in the near term will probably encourage more younger progressives to emphasize public protests, like the raucous rally for gun control that began the Tennessee confrontation, predicts Nse Ufot, who formerly led the New Georgia Project launched by Stacey Abrams. “The young people in Tennessee … went to their legislators and said enough, and they had accountable, accessible leaders who heard what their demands were and took it to their colleagues and their colleagues didn’t like it,” says Ufot, who has now founded the New South Super PAC, designed to elect progressive candidates in the 11 states of the old confederacy. Ufot uses a striking analogy to express her expectation of how this struggle will unfold in the coming years across the red states. Her mother, she explained, ran a shelter for battered women, and even as a young girl, she came to recognize “that the most dangerous time for victims of abuse is when they are preparing to leave, when they have made up their minds that they are done and they are making their exits. That when we see their abusers escalate to crazy tactics.” Ufot sees the Tennessee expulsions, like the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and Trump’s broader effort to overturn the 2020 result, as evidence that those “who are afraid of what a diverse, reflective, democracy looks like” will likewise turn to more extreme responses as the challenge to their position grows more acute. But she also sees the movement that erupted around Pearson and Jones as a preview of how younger generations may resist that offensive. “Instead of responding with resignation like people who have come before them, [the two expelled representatives] have chosen to do something about it,” she said. “And that’s what happens when you are forged in the fire of protest and are accountable to the people [you represent].” As the Republicans now running the red states race to the right, and younger generations lean harder on direct protest, more forging fires across this contested terrain appear inevitable.

      How Elon Musk transformed Twitter’s blue check from status symbol into a badge of shame
    ","Days after Elon Musk’s Twitter purged blue check marks from VIP users and prominent organizations, the checks reappeared on the accounts of a number of high-profile figures, many of whom promptly stressed they did not ask for or did not want the new verification badge. Those in the latter camp include the rapper Lil Nas X, The New York Times, the scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the journalist Kara Swisher, and even the legendary satirical account @dril, to name a few. Even the accounts of public figures known to be deceased, including Bob Saget, Kirstie Alley and Barbara Walters, have had their verification restored, and it is unclear how many of those badges Twitter may be handing out at no charge. The spectacle only added to mounting chaos at Twitter and highlighted how Musk has helped erode the value of the blue check at precisely the moment he’s betting on it to help drive subscription revenue for his company after a massive drop in its core advertising business. Once a recognizable online status symbol that was universally understood to authenticate influential accounts on the platform, the blue check’s symbol has evolved into something more confusing thanks to Musk’s decision to make it available for a price. It has also become outright politicized and a kind of referendum on Musk himself, reflected in the recent dueling hashtags #paythe8, backed by supporters of the new-style verification, facing off against #blocktheblue, which represents its critics. Over the weekend, numerous high-profile people announced — with apparent despair — that they too had been “punished” with verification badges. Some, including actor Chrissy Teigen, reported difficulties trying to get the check mark removed, attempting to change their display names to get it to disappear. (Teigen ultimately succeeded.) “It attached itself to me,” Teigen tweeted of the badge. “How did it happen so fast. like the movie It Follows.” The celebrity backlash, combined with the fact that Twitter apparently had to restore some of the badges at its own initiative and expense, reflects not only massive gaps in Musk’s plan and execution, but also how isolated Musk is from many of the celebrity users whose content has long kept Twitter afloat. The week after buying Twitter for $44 billion, Musk denounced the platform’s legacy approach to verifying celebrities, news organizations and government accounts. “Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bull***t,” Musk declared in November, announcing a plan to offer verified badges to any user who paid a monthly fee. “Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.” Musk decision to move forward with this plan, first by rolling out a paid verification option as part of the company’s subscription product Twitter Blue, and now by removing legacy blue checks from accounts, has seemingly led to unintended consequences at every step, including a wave of troubling impersonations and the potential for new scams and misinformation. His attempts to address these unforced errors has led him back to the very system he supposedly abolished — one in which Twitter unilaterally decides who is worthy or important enough to receive a verified badge. The major difference now is that Musk gets to call the shots. But in the process, he has made verification an even less transparent and meaningful indicator. Instead of conveying authenticity, Twitter verification is now fraught with multiple conflicting messages. Depending on the context, verification can now reflect a kind of loyalty pledge, a signal of proud support for the direction Musk is taking the company. Or, for some who did not want a badge but received one anyway, it reflects a kind of shame or embarrassment, a distinct sense of un-coolness. For still others, it is a suckers’ mark, a symbol of gullibility and subservience. “So, how do all the Musk fanboys and MAGA folks on this site feel about the fact that your conquering hero said he’d bring ‘equality’ and ‘people power’ to this site and then charged you all for Twitter Blue while giving it to people like me for free?” tweeted MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan. “Do you feel… owned?” The refusal of high-profile users to pay for verification is forcing Musk to pivot in ways that directly undermine the egalitarianism he claims to promote and raise questions about Twitter’s long-term potential to generate revenue. For weeks, many legacy verified users had signaled they would not be paying for Twitter Blue. The list of the unwilling included institutional users such as The New York Times as well as individuals such as the actor William Shatner. When the change finally went into effect on Thursday, Musk’s anticipated wave of subscriptions did not immediately pan out. According to independent researcher Travis Brown, who has been keeping a running tally of paying Twitter users, the past few days have resulted in a net increase of just 12,000 Twitter Blue accounts, for a total of 551,517. By comparison, Twitter’s last publicly disclosed figures before it went private reported more than 237 million active users. Some of those refusing to pay included LeBron James, Stephen King and Shatner. So Musk said he was comping their subscriptions, and only theirs. But that claim proved short-lived. Accounts belonging to everyone from President Joe Biden to Pope Francis also had their verification status restored, marking them as “a government or multilateral organization account.” And over the weekend, the checks once again appeared on the accounts of influential users who claimed not to have paid for them, creating the false perception that they had. New York City journalist Pat Kiernan, in describing his struggles to delete the new badge, has called it a thing of “regret” and “the opposite of desirable.” Put differently, changes to the badge’s substantive meaning did nothing to reduce the arbitrariness of the labeling but also led to the complete collapse of the badge’s cultural currency. And that is no small thing when Musk has tied the fate of the platform to subscription revenue. Musk’s initial plan appears to have been dependent on leveraging verification’s existing cachet as a status symbol to drive subscriptions. There are other features of Twitter’s subscription product, including the ability to edit tweets, but the paid verification option is a key selling point. But the very act of changing what verification meant has fundamentally transformed the badge’s value proposition into something few people appear to, well, value. Supporters of the new verification system have criticized those unwilling to pay as cheapskates or worse, and the argument would have an internal sort of logic if the new product did the same thing as the old product. What Musk is selling instead is a different product, and the result is nothing more than the free market’s collective shrug. Perhaps there was never going to be a world where high-profile accounts simply went unverified. After all, Musk needs famous people to be verified so that when users are shown Twitter’s algorithmically assembled For You feed by default, there will be quality content there for them to interact with. It doesn’t benefit Twitter for celebrity accounts to be buried along with the other non-paying accounts Musk has said the platform will demote. And that highlights the nagging problem Musk cannot escape: Despite his populist rhetoric, Musk’s backtracking on verification is yet another reminder that the internet and social media are not the democratizing force Silicon Valley keeps insisting it is, but a reincarnation of all the existing power structures and influence centers of the physical world. Some people really are so important that you’d want viewers to know it’s really them, payment or not. As if to underscore the issue, when Fox News and show host Tucker Carlson cut ties on Monday, it was a dramatic news event that seemed tailor-made for the real-time Twitter commentary that has always been central to the platform’s appeal. But instead of helping to drive engagement, the new verification system just seemed to get in the way, as some users expressed initial doubt as to whether the journalist accounts reporting the news were authentic.

      Depositors pulled $75 billion from Credit Suisse as it veered toward collapse
    ","Credit Suisse bled customer deposits worth 67 billion Swiss francs ($75.2 billion) in the first three months of the year, and money is still leaving the bank as UBS races to complete a rescue of its stricken rival. The bank run was “most acute” in the days just before and just after the announcement of the takeover by UBS
            
                (UBS) on March 19, Credit Suisse said in a statement Monday. Outflows have since “stabilized to much lower levels, but had not yet reversed as of April 24, 2023,” the bank added. Credit Suisse
            
                (CS) also reported net asset outflows of 61.2 billion francs ($68.7 billion) in the first quarter, a figure that includes some deposits. This amounted to about 5% of assets under management. The embattled lender’s first-quarter earnings could be its last after it was bought last month by UBS in an emergency deal orchestrated by the Swiss government. Regulators in Switzerland, the United States and United Kingdom have already approved the deal, in full or in part. Swiss authorities judged that the tie-up offered the best chance of restoring stability in the global banking sector, which had been rattled by the failure of two US regional banks. Credit Suisse had been plagued by scandals and compliance failures in recent years that wiped out its profit and caused it to lose clients. Customers withdrew 111 billion francs ($121 billion) in the final three months of 2022, when the bank was hit by social media speculation that it was on the brink of collapse. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in America months later drove a fresh wave of asset flight as investors and clients sought safer havens. Credit Suisse reported a 1.3 billion franc ($1.5 billion) loss for the first quarter, extending a losing streak that began in 2021. The bank posted a loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion) in 2022, its biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008. The parlous state of its business presents an enormous challenge to UBS as it executes a first-of-its-kind merger of two global banks with combined assets of nearly $1.7 trillion. Fully integrating the businesses will take three to four years, according to UBS chairman Colm Kelleher, who has warned of “huge” risks in combining the lenders. UBS has brought back its former CEO Sergio Ermotti to manage the complex task. Ermotti will need to cut thousands of jobs and downsize Credit Suisse’s investment bank, while aligning the lender with a more conservative risk culture. Kelleher told reporters earlier this month that UBS did not want to “import a bad culture” and would put all Credit Suisse employees through a “culture filter.” ",447,investing,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/investing/credit-suisse-bank-withdrawals-total/index.html

      NBCUniversal CEO stepping down over ‘inappropriate relationship’
    ","NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell is leaving the company after an outside investigation “into a complaint of inappropriate conduct,” its parent company Comcast announced Sunday. Shell will depart effective immediately in the wake of an investigation led by an outside counsel. “Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal. I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret,” Shell said in a statement. “I’m truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege.” The brief statement did not specify who the woman was or include any other details about the investigation. Comcast and NBCUniversal did not respond to requests for comment. The NBC staffer involved in the relationship filed a complaint in recent weeks, a person familiar with the matter said. Shell carried out his normal duties while the company engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation, the person added. There is no search underway for a successor to Shell, the person added. In the meantime, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh will assume Shell’s duties. Shell had been named CEO in January 2020 after leading content creation, programming and distribution for NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment. Shell had expressed confidence in NBC’s streaming service, Peacock, which surpassed 20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2022 and “nearly tripled” its revenue to $2.1 billion, according to its fourth quarter earnings report, which ended at the end of 2022. Its adjusted earnings loss, however, was wider. “There’s no question the whole television landscape is changing,” Shell said in an interview on CNBC “Squawk on the Street” last October. “If you have the right content, and you offer a broad distribution platform, your consumers are going to find you and that’s what we’re doing with Peacock.” Comcast is set to report its first quarter earnings on Thursday.

      Bed Bath & Beyond is closing hundreds of stores. But they won’t be empty for long
    ","Bed Bath & Beyond is stripping down its big blue signs, clearing out aisles of linens and closing hundreds of stores. The company filed for bankruptcy Sunday and said it will begin closing its remaining 360 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 120 buybuy Baby locations. Bed Bath & Beyond already has closed 400 stores over the past year. Already, chains including TJ Maxx, HomeGoods and Ross have scooped up some vacant stores. Burlington, Five Below, Nordstrom Rack and budget gym Planet Fitness may also fill up the spaces, say retail landlords and real estate analysts. Bed Bath & Beyond
            
                (BBBY)’s real estate is a precious, scarce resource for retailers, gyms and anyone else who needs ample space. There’s been little new retail development since the 2008 financial crisis and the rise of online shopping, and vacancy rates are at historic lows. “E-commerce scared a lot of people off from building retail,” said Brandon Isner, the head of retail research at CBRE, a commercial real estate firm. “A lot of great real estate is going to come available into a market where there’s been no vacancies. It will not take long for retailers to occupy those spaces.” Particularly in a tight commercial real estate market, bad news for one brand means opportunity for another. “For us, the biggest source of new store locations comes from other retailers closing stores,” Burlington CEO Michael O’Sullivan said on an analyst call in February. “So many of our most productive locations were formerly Circuit City or Toys ‘R’ Us or Sports Authority.” Store space is incredibly scarce at the moment, and that’s an ongoing trend: Total new commercial retail real estate construction reached a new low in 2022 for the third consecutive year, according to CBRE. And for existing spaces, the retail space vacancy rate fell to 4.9% at the end of 2022 — the lowest level since CBRE began tracking the market in 2005. So Bed Bath & Beyond has a lot to offer prospective tenants. The company has stores in all 50 states, with the most in population-dense areas in California, Texas, New Jersey and Florida. Plus, the majority of its stores are in the suburbs of mid-size and large cities and are under 50,000 square feet, all of which are attractive qualities in retail as brands trend toward smaller spaces to save on rent, labor and other overhead. “There is good interest for Bed Bath & Beyond stores that are closing given desirable locations” and an average size of around 30,000 square feet, retail analysts from Telsey Advisory Group said in a note to clients. In some cases, landlords are also eager to replace old Bed Bath & Beyond leases because the company was paying below-market rent in certain locations, Telsey Advisory Group analysts said. Bed Bath & Beyond has fallen to the “retail apocalypse” over the past decade, but many chains are still growing. Growth has been most pronounced in the discount segment of retail as shoppers on tight budgets search for low prices. Other companies are using their stores to ship online orders to customers, which can be more efficient than delivering orders from warehouses. In fact, despite high inflation and a pullback in retail sales, physical store openings exceeded closings last year for the first time since 2016, according to Coresight Research. And so far store opening announcements have outpaced store closures this year, the firm says, with Dollar General, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree and Five Below at the top. But it’s not only retailers looking for space and enjoying growth. Discount gym Planet Fitness is opening about 200 new gyms a year. “Bed Bath and Beyond sites are interesting to us, and we are exploring available opportunities with our franchisees,” a spokesperson told CNN. The company has previously opened gyms at former stores of two brands that filed for bankruptcy: Toys ‘R’ Us and Sears. A real estate investment trust that owns nine Bed Bath & Beyond stores, Federal Realty, is currently talking to chains like TJX, Burlington, Ross, Nordstrom Rack, Container Store and others about moving into Bed Bath & Beyond spaces. Once an agreement is finalized, it usually takes 18 to 24 months for the new retailer to open. “We feel pretty bullish based on the demand that we’ve seen that we’ll be able to release all of these spaces to other retailers,” said Lance Billingsley, the company’s senior vice president of anchor leasing. He also believes Bed Bath & Beyond may not be able to avoid bankruptcy or liquidation, which would lead to more vacancies. Meanwhile, another home goods retailer, Tuesday Morning, will close more than 250 stores this year. A&G Real Estate Partners is auctioning off leases to the stores, which are 10,000 to 20,000 square feet, said Mike Matlat, A&G’s senior managing director. Discount chains are interested in moving into those spaces because they’re small and already built, Matlat said. “With not a lot of new development going on, everyone’s growth will come from second-generation space,” he said.

      Low employee engagement? Managers can help turn it around with this one habit
    ","Employers who want a productive, engaged workforce could do more to train, develop and support those in their managerial ranks. That’s because managers are the secret sauce. Gallup’s Quarterly Workforce Indicator surveys consistently show that managers are a linchpin to employee engagement, retention, productivity and trust in leadership. As it turns out, effective training for managers is not a thing at many workplaces. “I would say 99% of employers don’t provide effective training — and I’m not exaggerating there,” said Ashley Herd, a former human resources executive who founded @ManagerMethod. “While some provide training, rarely is it effective [in providing] the guidance needed to help managers understand how to meet business goals while supporting employees in the right way,” she said. One key thing managers need to know is how to communicate well. In fact, how managers speak with employees — and how often — can go a long way to building employees’ trust and commitment, according to Gallup. Managers who already feel stretched thin may not be psyched to hear this, but one of Gallup’s surveys — which included responses from more than 67,000 US workers — found that the most effective way to make someone feel connected to an organization is to have a “meaningful” conversation every week with each direct report to discuss goals, customers and well-being as well as offer recognition. The recommended time to allot for each conversation: 15 to 30 minutes. Sounds like a lot. But if you have, say, a team of 10 people, you’re talking about walling off no more than 2.5 hours a week. “We find this single habit develops high-performance relationships more than any other single leadership activity,” Gallup researchers noted. The workplace research firm’s surveys have found that the ratio of engaged to actively disengaged US workers is 1.8-to-1 today, down from a record high of 2.7-to-1 in 2019. The purpose of regular check-ins, researchers noted, is to have “strengths-based conversations that bring clarity and purpose to work — which is now deteriorating in US organizations.” Helping employees to feel connected is especially critical in a hybrid work environment, which done right can itself also boost employee engagement, Gallup found. In a separate study, Gallup has found that employees feeling free to speak truthfully about the effects of big changes at work is one key way to build trust in leaders. “When employees strongly agree that they have had opportunities to provide honest feedback about organizational changes, they are 7.4 times as likely to have confidence in their leaders to successfully manage emerging challenges,” Gallup research noted. Herd offered a few recommendations for what employers can do to improve their development of managers. For starters, she said: Survey managers: Find out what training they are receiving, what training they would like to see and what they do that works well for their teams.Survey employees: Find out what support they are getting from their managers, and what they would like to see.Appoint someone to lead trainings: Name an internal learning and development contact or someone from HR to gather information on best practices from those surveys. Have that person then lead an internal training for managers and another one for employees about how to work with their managers. Ask a handful of participants in each to talk about the best practices they’ve used — and have different leaders talk about their styles (e.g., extrovert or introvert), how they found their voice and how they work with different personalities on their teams.Set baseline requirements for communications with employees. One might be for managers to regularly meet with direct reports and not cancel on them except in a true emergency or when the manager is on PTO. Have managers share their meeting agendas ahead of time with employees. That way the manager and employee can add items if they wish. Encourage managers to listen. “[Remind them to] ask questions of employees, rather than just talk themselves,” Herd said.

      Democratic senators want to ban stock trading in Congress
    ","Last year, the S&P 500 fell 18%, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at the portfolios of US lawmakers. Overall holdings by members of the US Congress outperformed the S&P 500 by about 17.5% on average in 2022, according to Subversive Capital, a company that creates ETFs which track stock trading by senators and representatives. Some Democratic Senators think that divergence could have an unethical slant to it. In response, they’ve announced a new bill, The Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks (ETHICS) Act, that would prohibit all members of Congress and their family members from buying or selling individual stocks. The act is the product of a working group formed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer more than a year ago to address reports of rampant insider trading amongst lawmakers. Multiple news outlets reported that numerous members of Congress had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees. Several members of Congress were also scrutinized for their financial transactions during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when they received closed-door briefings that warned of an impending financial crash. The ETHICS Act would not only ban lawmakers, their spouses and dependent children from trading single stocks, it would also create a searchable, electronic database of their holdings and impose large penalties for any violations. Before the Bell spoke with Sen. Jeff Merkley, the lead sponsor of the Senate bill. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: What does this bill do? Who can trade and under what parameters? Sen. Jeff Merkley: I’ve been trying to push this notion that there are deep conflicts created by members [of Congress] trading stocks, and they’re significant enough that they both produce corruption and they certainly produce the impression among the public of corruption. For both reasons that stock trading needs to end. There’s two forms of corruption. One is that having a portfolio of individual stocks concentrated in a particular area changes a member’s view of how they would write legislation that might include breaks for that particular industry that would drive the value of their stock. It might change how they would vote on legislation. And then there’s the second aspect, which is that members have access to often confidential information and briefings that precedes actions by the [Biden] administration, or what bills are going to be coming to the floor. That is information that the public doesn’t have. The result is members tend to do better than the general public and better than the S&P 500. There’s an unfair advantage for [lawmakers], you could tackle that by just ending the trading of individual stocks. Have you witnessed anything in the Senate or among lawmakers that makes you think unethical trading is taking place? I can tell you this, in the course of both the briefings here on the Hill and in fundraising that members do, including myself, you will hear people say, ‘hey, six months from now we’re planning to launch product XYZ.’ And you kind of walk away from that going ‘I’m so glad I’m not trading individual stocks, because it would be wrong for me to have that information that the public doesn’t have.’ How would this bill actually enforce these new rules? I’ll start with really expensive penalties that will scare people a lot. If you’re in violation of the selling, buying or holding provisions of this law in any given month, the penalty is a month’s salary, or 10% of the amount of stocks that were traded or held. And that is a huge amount. If this bill were to pass, would some members forego reelection? The provision for lawmakers buying stock goes into effect immediately. The provision for not selling goes into effect after 90 days, so they can sell their portfolio. The place where it affects reelection is the spouse and children. The conversation among members was that in this modern age, spouses have their own lives and their own habits. And while it’s fair to change the rules right away for us, it’s not fair to do that to spouses, so the rules would only be applied to them after reelection. I think there’s just a widespread sense that this bill has to apply to spouses and minor children. A version of this bill was released and didn’t pass. What makes this different when other efforts have previously stalled? This is a product of intense conversations throughout our caucus and with everyone in the caucus who produced a bill last time, and of conversations with a whole bunch of Republicans that we strived to work with. Sen. Elizabeth Warren had conversations with Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. Steve Daines of Montana. This is the most comprehensive bill to come out of all those discussions. It has by far the largest number of sponsors in the Senate, 21, that any bill has had to date. Would you consider a bill that applies the same restrictions to the Supreme Court? There is a huge appetite for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. There was a sense among members that we need to get our own house in order. Show what it looks like and then take the principles we learn to extend to the judiciary and the executive branch. And you know, many of us would like to write them in now, but anything you do that makes the bill more complicated now makes it less likely we ever get the bill passed. So, on balance it seemed like the more responsible thing to do was to say ‘let’s prove we can get our own house in order before we start lecturing other branches of the government.’ Bed Bath & Beyond officially filed for bankruptcy on Sunday. “Thank you to all of our loyal customers. We have made the difficult decision to begin winding down our operations,” a statement at the top of the company’s website said Sunday morning. The news was expected, as the store had been struggling to stay afloat for months. But what comes next is still unclear. The company’s 360 Bed Bath & Beyond locations, along with its 120 buybuy BABY stores, will remain open for now, reports my colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn. Websites will also remain active and the company secured a $240 million loan to help fund its operations during bankruptcy. But store closing sales will begin Wednesday, and Bed Bath & Beyond will close some stores. Just how many – or what happens to its 14,000 employees — depends on what happens next. Here’s the thing: A bankruptcy filing does not necessarily mean that a company is going out of business. Many major US companies have filed for bankruptcy, using it to shed debt and other costs they could no longer afford. But even if Bed Bath and Beyond does emerge from bankruptcy, its future is not guaranteed. The company said it would seek to sell some or all of its business. If it’s able to find a buyer, Bed Bath & Beyond will halt store closings. But if a buyer doesn’t come forward, Bed Bath & Beyond will likely be liquidated entirely and go out of business.

      So this is how the Tupperware party ends
    ","Tupperware, an iconic brand that’s woven into the fabric of post World War II America, signaled this week that it could be on its last gasp. Known the world over for its plastic food storage containers and its sales parties, Florida-based Tupperware warned that the company was running out of cash and needed additional money – soon – to say in operation. In some ways, the 77-year-old brand is still a titan: It’s, literally, a household name, and its vivid juice- and fruit-colored products are for sale in nearly 70 countries. It pulled in annual sales of $1.3 billion in 2021. But that’s down 18.7% from a year ago. Last October, in a massive shift in its business model, Tupperware rolled out its containers in brighter hues of red, purple and green onto Target shelves nationwide. But it may be too little, too late. Experts say this is what happens when a once-pioneering brand, beloved by families through generations, is unable to adapt to an evolving marketplace, brutal competition and attitudes and needs of younger consumers. “Tupperware was a disruptor in the market and in households nationwide when its plastic storage containers launched in 1946,” said Venkatesh Shankar, professor of marketing and ecommerce at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School. “The company also had tremendous cultural impact. The famous neighborhood house parties where Tupperware products were sold by the host to her family and friends was a new way of marketing, combining socializing with direct sales.” But while the company reaped the benefits of its innovative approach for years, it ultimately couldn’t keep pace with changing times. History has shown, said Shankar, that nostalgia usually isn’t enough to sustain legacy brands. Whether or not Tupperware survives as a business, its rich history will likely endure, said William Keep, professor of marketing at the College of New Jersey School of Business. “I’ve been married for 50 years and we still have and use our Tupperware from when we married. Tupperware was something people gave as gifts at weddings and baby showers,” said Keep. “Clearly its a brand that focused on two things, quality and for much of its history, women.” Tupperware is named after Earl Tupper, a chemist in the 1940s who created lightweight, non-breakable plastic containers inspired by the seal-tight design of paint cans. The purpose was to help families save money on costly food waste in the post-war era. The most significant aspect of the invention was a first-of-its-kind “burping seal.” The older models of Tupperware containers would make a burp-like sound when air was let out from under the lid before it was firmly pressed and closed for an air-tight lock. But Tupperware products didn’t sell well in stores when they launched, according to the company, because consumers weren’t sure how to use the (back then) white and off-white containers. That conundrum led to an idea to demonstrate the product, which then evolved into the famous Tupperware house parties. The practice dove-tailed brilliantly with the rise of post-war suburbia: women had bigger homes, bigger kitchens, more money to spend, more children to feed and more responsibilities to keep house. Into that climate came Tupperware. Its first milky-white plastic product, the “Wonder Bowl,” cost 39 cents, according to Smithsonian Magazine; the museum has a huge Tupperware collection. Over the years, tangerine orange, baby blue and pink and kiwi green products followed. Tupperware parties became popular social and marketing events in the 1950s and 60s. The parties were much more than just a show-and-tell, said Bob Kealing, a Tupperware scholar and author of two books on the brand. These were glamorous affairs, akin to an afternoon tea party, where women dressed up because the parties were a feminized, soft-sell approach to selling plastic products. “Women wore beautiful dresses, heels, gloves. They wanted to present an upscale version of themselves because these were also events where women were recruited into the Tupperware sales force,” he said. The parties gained traction also because they were one of the few socially acceptable ways for women to make money at the time. Tupperware products were the centerpiece of the event, carefully stacked and presented to be shown off. “The parties were designed to be fun social gatherings,” including games and prizes, he said, and the most successful Tupperware saleswomen were sometimes rewarded with diamond rings. While Tupperware wasn’t the first to pioneer the direct sales model, it did scale it up in size and opportunity for women, said Tracey Deutsch, associate professor, department of history  of history at University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts. Tupperware’s success, said Deutsch also coincided with the expansion of suburbs across the country. “Not only did women need the space to hold the Tupperware parties but also space in the kitchen to store these containers,” she said. “And it was also dependent on a certain level of household well-being. You needed to have enough food to require these storage containers.” Brownie Wise was perhaps the most famous Tupperware hostess of them all. Wise, a divorced single mother living in Florida, held her own Tupperware parties in the 1940s and 50s and became a budding entrepreneur. Tupper himself took notice. He eventually hired Wise as his vice president of marketing, an unprecedented role for women back then. Kealing, author of “”Life of the Party: The Remarkable Story of How Brownie Wise Built, and Lost, a Tupperware Part Empire,”  said Wise became the face of the brand and was very good at it. “It was great marketing and the media ate it up,” he said. But she was ultimately fired by Tupper in 1957. “Tupper… saw how the brand was becoming more about her,” said Kealing. Traditionally, parties were the only way you could buy Tupperware. Over time, the parties became ubiquitous both in suburban and city dwellings.  As the company grew, its fleet of hostesses ballooned into a global direct sales force of nearly 3 million in 2019. More recently, the brand was on a quest to grab the attention of Millennials and Gen Zers and become as relevant in their everyday lives as it was for their grandmas and moms. That meant shedding the throwback to its “Mad Men” era image, and positioning Tupperware products as buzz-worthy, higher quality and more durable than rivals, high-utility and with an environmentally-friendly purpose. Tupperware had to go beyond parties or sales on its own website and the brief and limited pilot programs it had tried with retailers HomeGoods, Bed Bath and Beyond, plus an earlier pilot attempt at Target itself. The shift in strategy came too late. “We’ve seen this happen with Toys ‘R’ Us, Twinkie, most recently Bed Bath & Beyond,” said Shankar. Tupperware, he said, is facing a perfect storm of stiff competition from other brands – Rubbermaid, Glad, Pyrex, Oxo and Ziploc – selling similar products or even disposable versions for less, lack of interest from younger shoppers and lack of exciting new products and strategies to sell them. “Millennials, and Gen Zers especially probably aren’t aware of its iconic status and really don’t have a reason to give it another chance,” said Shankar. “In my mind, the company made two critical errors,” said Keep, professor of marketing at the College of New Jersey School of Business. “With product, it lost ground to competitors”, said Keep. “Tupperware also consciously didn’t walk away from direct selling even as these multilevel marketing strategies stagnated in the 80s and 90s. When it was clear that model was no longer working, the company should have given up on direct sales and sold through retailers.” Bankruptcy could be a path forward for Tupperware, said John Talbott, Director at the Center for Education and Research in Retail at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. “The most valuable thing Tupperware owns is its brand. Like Blockbuster, the Tupperware brand will never go away,” he said. “I suspect it could file for bankruptcy and if there is a buyer for it, Target would be a great option to revive the brand with new designs and a new marketing plan.” ",1343,business,2023-04-13,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/tupperware-history/index.html

      Bed Bath & Beyond plans to liquidate all inventory and go out of business
    ","Bed Bath & Beyond, the store for seemingly everything in your home during the 1990s and 2000s, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday. “Thank you to all of our loyal customers. We have made the difficult decision to begin winding down our operations,” a statement at the top of the company’s website said Sunday morning. The company’s 360 Bed Bath & Beyond locations, along with its 120 buybuy BABY stores, will remain open for now, as will websites. The company secured a $240 million loan to help fund its operations during bankruptcy. But store closing sales will begin Wednesday, and Bed Bath & Beyond will close some stores. Just how many – or what happens to its 14,000 employees –depends on what happens next. A bankruptcy filing does not necessarily mean that a company is going out of business. Many major US companies have filed for bankruptcy, using it to shed debt and other costs they could no longer afford. But even if Bed Bath and Beyond does emerge from bankruptcy, its future is not guaranteed. The company said it would seek to sell some or all of its business. If it’s able to find a buyer, Bed Bath & Beyond will halt store closings. But if a buyer doesn’t come forward, Bed Bath & Beyond will likely be liquidated entirely and go out of business. It’s also possible the company could emerge from bankruptcy as an online-only retailer, said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail. “Ultimately, if it emerges from bankruptcy at all, Bed Bath & Beyond will be a shadow of its former self,” he said. Bed Bath & Beyond had been a crown jewel of the era of so-called “category killers” — chains that dominated a category of retail, such as Toys “R” Us, Circuit City and Sports Authority. Those companies, too, ultimately filed for bankruptcy as shoppers turned away from huge specialty stores in favor of online options like Amazon. Bed Bath & Beyond became known for pots and pans, towels and bedding stacked from the floor to the ceiling at its cavernous stores — and for its ubiquitous 20%-off coupons. The blue-and-white coupons became something of a pop culture symbol, and millions of Americans wound up stashing them away in their cars, closets and basements. The company said customers will have Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to use their remaining 20%-off coupons. The company will stop accepting them Wednesday. Instead, Bed Bath & Beyond expects to offer “deep discounts” on its products as part of its going-out-of-business sales. The retailer attracted a broad range of customers by selling name brands at cut-rate prices. Brands coveted a spot on Bed Bath & Beyond’s shelves, knowing it would lead to big sales. Plus, the open-store layout encouraged impulse buying: Shoppers would come in to buy new dishes and walk out with pillows, towels and other items. Stores were a fixture for shoppers around the winter holidays and during the back-to-school and college seasons, and Bed Bath & Beyond also had a strong baby and wedding registry business. But the New Jersey-based company has been slow to respond to shopping changes and struggled to entice customers who had moved on to Amazon, Target and other chains. In its bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond said it had $5.2 billion in debt and assets of just $4.4 billion. It secured $240 million in financing Sunday to stay afloat just long enough to close its stores and wind down its operations. The company encouraged shoppers to seek out its discounted merchandise later this week. Items purchased before Wednesday can be returned until May 24, but all sales after Wednesday will be final. The store will stop accepting gift cards on May 8. Founded in 1971 by Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, two veterans of the discount retail industry in Springfield, New Jersey, the chain of small linen and bath stores — then called Bed ‘n Bath — first grew around the northeast and in California selling designer bedding, a new trend at the time. Unlike department stores, it didn’t rely on sales events to draw in customers. The company changed its name to Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987 to reflect its expanded merchandise and bigger “superstores.” The company went public in 1992 with 38 stores and around $200 million in sales. “We had witnessed the department store shakeout and knew that specialty stores were going to be the next wave of retailing,” Feinstein said in 1993. “It was the beginning of the designer approach to linens and housewares and we saw a real window of opportunity.” By 2000, those figures leapt to 241 stores and $1.1 billion in annual sales. The 1,000th Bed Bath & Beyond store opened in 2009, when the chain had reached $7.8 billion in annual sales. The company was something of an iconoclast. It spent little on advertising, relying instead on print coupons distributed in weekly newspapers to attract customers. “Why not just tell the customer that we’ll give you a discount on the item you want — and not the one that we want to put on sale? We’ll mail a coupon, and it will be a lot cheaper,” Eisenberg said in a 2020 New York Times interview. The chain was known for giving autonomy to store managers to decide which products to stock, allowing them to customize their individual stores, and for shipping products directly to stores instead of a central warehouse. But as brick-and-mortar began to give way to e-commerce, Bed Bath & Beyond was slow to make the transition — a misstep compounded by the fact that home decor is one of the most commonly bought categories online. “We missed the boat on the internet,” Eisenberg said in a recent Wall Street Journal interview. (The co-founders are no longer involved with the company.) Online shopping weakened the allure of Bed Bath & Beyond’s fan-favorite coupons, too, because consumers could find plenty of cheaper alternatives on Amazon or browse a wider selection on sites like Wayfair
            
                (W). It wasn’t just Amazon and online shopping that sank Bed Bath & Beyond, however. Walmart
            
                (WMT), Target
            
                (TGT) and Costco
            
                (COST) have grown over the past decade, and they have been able to draw Bed Bath & Beyond customers with lower prices and a wider array of merchandise. Discount chains such as HomeGoods and TJ Maxx have also undercut Bed Bath & Beyond’s prices. Without the differentiators of the lowest prices or widest selection, Bed Bath & Beyond’s sales stagnated from 2012 to 2019. Then the pandemic hit in 2020. The company temporarily closed all of its stores while rivals deemed “essential retailers” like Walmart remained open. Sales sank 17% in 2020 and 15% in 2021. What’s more, Bed Bath & Beyond has rotated through several different executives and turnaround strategies in recent years. Former Target executive Mark Tritton took the helm in 2019 with backing from investors and a bold new strategy. He scaled back coupons and inventory from national brands in favor of Bed Bath & Beyond’s own private-label brands. But this change alienated customers who were loyal to big brands. The company also fell behind on payments to vendors, and stores did not have enough merchandise to stock shelves. Tritton stepped down as CEO in 2022. Bed Bath & Beyond
            
                (BBBY) has been teetering on the brink of bankruptcy for months. In February, it was able to stave off bankruptcy by completing a complex stock offering that gave it both an immediate injection of cash and a pledge for more funding in the future to pay down its debt. That offering was backed by private equity group Hudson Bay Capital. But Bed Bath & Beyond last month said it terminated the deal with Hudson Bay Capital for future funding and was turning to the public market to try to raise funds. The company has also been shrinking to save money. It said earlier this year it would close around 400 locations, but would keep open profitable stores in key markets. And the company tried to save money by not paying severance to some laid-off workers at closing stores. Bed Bath & Beyond laid off 1,295 workers in New Jersey this month, just days before a new state law kicked in that mandates severance pay — equal to one week of pay for each year of employment — for workers who lose their job. All these moves were not enough to keep the once-dominant chain out of bankruptcy, however. And Bed Bath & Beyond is the latest retail chain to file for bankruptcy this year. Bankruptcies are piling up in the retail sector as interest rates go up and discretionary spending slows down. David’s Bridal, Party City, Tuesday Morning, mattress manufacturer Serta Simmons and Independent Pet Partners, a pet store retailer, have filed for bankruptcy in recent weeks.

      ‘Too good to be true?’ As Shein and Temu take off, so does the scrutiny
    ","Temu and Shein are taking off in the United States, topping app stores and creating a frenzy with consumers. But as the two online shopping platforms become hugely popular, they’re also facing questions over a litany of issues, including how they’re able to sell goods at such strikingly low prices, how transparent they are with the public and how much environmental waste their businesses generate. Some of those questions aren’t unique to the two companies: Longtime fast-fashion producers like Zara or H&M
            
                (HNNMY) have faced similar concerns. But in recent weeks, Temu and Shein have also faced greater scrutiny over their ties to China, the country where their businesses originated and where they continue to rely on manufacturers. Shein was started in China, while Temu was launched by a Chinese company that now bills itself as a multinational firm. They are based in Singapore and Boston, respectively. That may matter little to policymakers. As US-China tensions remain high, American legislators have increased attempts to restrict technology linked in any way to foreign entities. Earlier this month, a US congressional commission called out Shein and Temu in a report that suggested the companies and others in China were potentially linked to the use of forced labor, exploitation of trade loopholes, product safety hazards or intellectual property theft. Both firms have enjoyed major success in the United States, noted Nicholas Kaufman, a policy analyst for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. This “has encouraged both established Chinese e-commerce platforms and startups to copy their model, posing risks and challenges to US regulations, laws, and principles of market access,” he wrote. “Like Shein, Temu’s success raises flags about its business practices,” Kaufman added. Asked about the report, Shein said in a statement that it “takes visibility across our supply chain seriously.” “For over a decade, we have been providing customers with on-demand and affordable fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products, lawfully and with full respect for the communities we serve,” a spokesperson said. Temu did not respond to a request for comment. Temu and Shein have taken the world’s largest retail market — the United States — by storm. Temu, which runs a marketplace for virtually everything from home goods to apparel to electronics, was launched by PDD Holdings
            
                (PDD) last year. It has quickly become the most downloaded app in the United States, and continues to expand its user base. PDD was founded in China but recently began billing itself as a Cayman Islands company, citing a new corporate registration there. As of a February regulatory filing, PDD’s head office was in Shanghai. Temu says it doesn’t operate in China. PDD also owns Pinduoduo, a hugely popular Chinese e-commerce giant that was found in a recent CNN investigation to have the ability to spy on its users. According to cybersecurity researchers, Pinduoduo can circumvent users’ mobile security to see what they’re doing on other apps, read their messages and even change settings. While Temu has not been implicated, the allegations about its sister company have invited further scrutiny and were cited in the Congress report on Temu this month. PDD did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for comment on the investigation. Shein, which was founded by Chinese entrepreneur Chris Xu, has enjoyed similar success with its app over the last few years. The company initially created a cult following for its fast-fashion apparel and has since branched out into other offerings, such as home goods. Both companies have gained traction stateside by offering extreme bargains to shoppers, many of whom continue to feel the squeeze from historically high inflation. “The timing is very advantageous,” said Michael Felice, an associate partner in Kearney’s communications, media and technology practice. “You have extreme pressure on the consumer wallet right now.” While Temu and Shein may appear similar, they have different business models. Temu operates as an online store, carrying merchandise from independent sellers. Shein, on the other hand, commissions its own goods through manufacturers it teams up with in what is effectively seen as a supersonic version of fast fashion. For some consumers, the companies’ low prices have raised eyebrows. “I think transparency and traceability of product is becoming more important,” said Felice. “When you’re starting to see price points that almost could be too good to be true, you start to ask yourself, ‘Is that too good to be true?’” Felice also said there was a risk of Temu facing resistance from US consumers as a cross-border business. “There’s a rising sense of nationalism in markets,” he said. “It will be interesting to see which one wins as the dual pressures of inflation and nationalism take hold on American consumers.” Lawmakers are also getting more hawkish. While both Temu and Shein have taken steps to separate their businesses from links to China, geopolitical tensions are proving hard to shake off. Last month, a bipartisan group of US senators introduced legislation that would give the government new powers, including a ban on foreign-linked producers of software. In a fact sheet distributed by lawmakers, Temu’s surge on US app stores was described as an example of how Chinese consumer technology was becoming more popular. “From the history of the companies to where their products come from, it’s very hard to say you’re not related to China,” said Sheng Lu, an associate professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware. Similar to TikTok, which faces the prospect of a US ban, Lu believes that Temu and Shein could face data privacy concerns from regulators. “They’re large, influential and collect data,” he said. “This can make the companies a potential sensitive topic.” The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Around 85% of clothing ends up in landfills or is burned. Experts say the problem is even worse with fast fashion, defined as the rapid design and production of cheap and low-quality goods that respond to fleeting trends. These are “disposable fashion companies,” said Maxine Bédat, founder of the New Standard Institute. “That’s the crux of what they are. This stuff is not meant to last in your wardrobe,” she added. “Their business wouldn’t function if it did.” Shein argues that its business model enables it to reduce waste and overproduction by producing small batches and only responding with larger production if demand is shown. The company has set a goal of reducing emissions by 25% by 2030, based on 2021 figures. Temu, which markets itself more as a general store than a fashion outlet, also said its model limits unsold inventory and waste by better matching demand with supply. The company told CNN it offsets emissions for every order with “carbon credits which support wildlife conservation efforts” in the United States, though it did not provide details. Researchers who study textile waste and sustainability in global supply chains say the companies need to go further. Shein, for example, often uses low-cost fabrics that are hard to recycle. Compared with other fashion retailers, the company has a much lower percentage of products that mention using sustainable or recycled textile materials, said Lu. There are also concerns about the conditions of workers who make some of the companies’ products. In February, a bipartisan group of US senators wrote to Shein, pressing the company on its supply chain practices and calling for greater transparency in its supply chain. “We are concerned that American consumers may be inadvertently purchasing apparel made in part with cotton grown, picked, and processed using forced labor,” the senators said. The inquiry was made following a Bloomberg report showing lab testing on two occasions last year found that garments shipped to the United States by Shein were made with cotton from Xinjiang. Washington has banned all imports from the Chinese region over concerns of forced labor. In a statement to CNN, Shein said it was committed to respecting human rights and adhering to laws and regulations in the countries where it operates. A spokesperson said the company had zero tolerance for forced labor, and worked with third parties to audit supplier factories. To ensure compliance with US laws, Shein requires that suppliers purchase cotton from approved countries, and has built tracing systems to get visibility into the origins of cotton it uses, the spokesperson added. Temu has not faced such questions, though its sister company received backlash in 2021 over allegations that it overworks its staff. Pinduoduo said at the time that it would provide counseling following the suicide of a worker. Worker rights at Shein also made headlines in December, when a documentary by UK broadcaster Channel 4 alleged exploitation at two Chinese factories belonging to its suppliers. The program claimed staff were working 18 hours a day, making the equivalent of pennies on each item. CNN has not independently verified the allegations. Shein responded to the claims, saying independent audits had refuted most of the allegations. But it conceded that the investigation had showed workers at two of its suppliers were working longer hours than allowed. The company has since reduced the size of its orders from those producers on an interim basis, and committed $15 million to upgrade hundreds of its partner factories. Still, the “working conditions of workers making Shein’s products remain a black box,” said Lu, the University of Delaware professor. “Shein should be more transparent about their factory conditions and workers’ well-being.” ",1576,tech,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/tech/temu-shein-us-concerns-intl-hnk/index.html

      Russia’s shadowy energy trade is raising fears of a devastating oil spill
    ","The waters of the Bay of Lakonikos, on the south-eastern side of Greece’s Peloponnese peninsula, are a bright turquoise color. Its shores are an important nesting site for sea turtles. Yet it’s not just a place of natural beauty. The area has become a key hub for tankers carrying Russian energy exports. As crude and refined petroleum products that would usually go to the European Union are rerouted to Asia — with most seaborne oil imports banned by the bloc in response to Moscow’s assault on Ukraine — cargoes are being transferred here onto larger vessels to make the long trip. Ship-to-ship transfers of Russian crude have mushroomed in recent months, reaching a record high during the first three months of the year, according to data from S&P Global, a research firm. Near Greece, more than 3.5 million barrels of Russian gasoil, a refined product used in heating and transport systems, were transferred between ships in March. That’s more than seven times the volume tallied by S&P Global for that month in 2022. The transfers highlight the dramatic transformation of the global oil market since President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly 14 months ago. As China, India and Turkey fill the void left by Europe, once the top buyer of Russian oil and oil products, trips have lengthened, requiring more ships — and S&P Global data indicates mid-journey handoffs have become more common. “We’ve seen a big increase in ship transfers in the Mediterranean,” said Matthew Wright, senior freight analyst at Kpler, a data group. “Smaller vessels come in from Russian ports, they transfer the cargoes onto larger vessels, and then those larger vessels will head off to Asia.” Many of these ships are part of what’s become known as the “gray fleet.” Industry insiders like Wright use this term to refer to vessels that started carrying Russian oil in the past year. For many, little is known about their owners, which may be a shell company. The “gray fleet” isn’t necessarily doing anything underhanded. But Western observers like Wright say the emergence of this network, where ownership is often masked, has reduced transparency in the oil market, making it harder for regulators to keep watch. Australia, Canada and United States recently said in a submission to the International Maritime Organization that more ships were illegally turning off their transponders, or “going dark,” before transferring oil in international waters. Switching off transponders, which transmit location data, can be a way of dodging sanctions, they said. Fred Kenney, the IMO’s director of legal and external affairs, told CNN that alarm about this practice had grown over the past year. Collisions are more likely in such cases, raising the odds of a devastating oil spill. It’s also harder to tell whether the vessels with murky ownership comply with the strict rules governing oil transfers at sea, according to Kenney. “There is a significant level of concern that the regulatory regime that ensures safe and secure shipping on clean oceans is being undermined,” he said. Russia’s oil export volumes have rebounded to levels last seen before it invaded Ukraine, according to the International Energy Agency, although the country is still grappling with a sharp drop in revenue from these exports. Group of Seven nations have imposed a cap on the price of Russian oil and oil products, and a smaller pool of buyers can also negotiate greater discounts. China’s imports of Russian oil in the first quarter of the year rose 38% compared with a year prior, according to Kpler data. India’s have skyrocketed almost tenfold. As trade of Russian oil has become more complex, many Western shippers have pulled back. New, more opaque players have stepped in, contributing to the formation of the “gray fleet.” According to VesselsValue, a UK-based market intelligence firm, sales of oil tankers to newly formed companies or undisclosed buyers account for roughly 33% of tanker deals so far this year. Sales to unknown buyers accounted for just 10% of the total in 2022 and 4% in 2021. Using satellite images from space technology firm Maxar, CNN was able to home in on pairs of oil tankers dotting the Bay of Lakonikos. Together with Kpler, CNN has worked out the details of one of the transfers. According to data from the two ships’ transponders, the smaller tanker docked in St. Petersburg, Russia, where it picked up a cargo of fuel oil in late February. CNN then tracked it around Western Europe to the Mediterranean Sea. At that point, it unloaded its cargo onto the larger ship that had arrived from the direction of the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk in Russia. Kpler considers this vessel to be part of the “gray fleet.” From there, the larger tanker continued through the Suez Canal, the primary sea route from Europe to Asia. As transactions such as these become more common, experts are growing increasingly worried about the risks. While transferring oil from one ship to another is not unusual, Kenney of the IMO said “gray fleet” ships — more difficult to monitor if it’s not clear who owns them — might not be following best practices. “There [are] myriad things that can go wrong in a ship-to-ship transfer, which is why there is a comprehensive set of industry rules that govern these transfers,” he said, noting the potential for a spill. Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom have pointed out that there is a higher risk of accidental collisions between ships if transponders are turned off. Kpler documented multiple instances of this practice, which is almost always illegal, in 2022. “When we see ships, or we get reports of ships turning off their transponders, it’s concerning to us,” Kenney said.

      China makes major push in its ambitious digital yuan project
    ","Public sector workers in an eastern Chinese city are set to be paid fully in digital yuan, as the country makes a significant push to popularize the currency. Changshu, located in the province of Jiangsu, will start the new payment process in May, according to an official document widely posted on government websites. This is the biggest rollout of the currency, also known as the e-CNY, in China so far, according to state media. Government employees as well as staff at state-owned companies and public institutions such as schools, hospitals, libraries, research institutes and media organizations in the city will be affected. Changshu, a city of 1.7 million residents, was already experimenting with the digital yuan, a form of money that exists only online and is managed and backed by China’s central bank. Like cryptocurrency, the digital yuan incorporates some elements of blockchain technology: Every transaction is recorded and traceable in a digital ledger. Since last October, Changshu has been paying the transit subsidies for some government employees in digital yuan. China is already on the verge of becoming a cashless society, but the vast majority of electronic transactions happen on privately owned apps (Alipay and WeChat Pay), outside of the immediate purview of the state. An official yuan would change that, giving Beijing an unprecedented amount of information about what people are spending their money on and where. The world’s second largest economy has been trialing the digital yuan in Chinese cities since 2020, as it prepares for a national rollout that could put China ahead of Europe and the United States in the global race to develop a state-backed digital currency, which is also known as central bank digital currency (CBDC). The timeline for a nationwide launch has not yet been announced, but Beijing has tried many ways of marketing the currency. Last January, the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, released a wallet app on Apple and Android stores that can be used in more than a dozen cities and regions that were piloting the currency. At the same time, it pressured businesses, including big Western companies such as McDonald’s
            
                (MCD) and Nike
            
                (NKE), to allow customers to use the digital yuan during the Beijing Winter Olympics. Several Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shenzhen, have even given away millions of dollars in digital yuan to their residents outright, encouraging them to use the virtual money. It has also asked privately-owned apps to actively promote the digital yuan. Alipay began trialing digital yuan payments in 2021, and Tencent
            
                (TCEHY) announced last year that it would also start supporting the digital yuan in its WeChat Pay wallet. But the currency has struggled to gain traction. Transactions using the currency totaled just 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) by the end of last August, equivalent to an average of 3.6 billion yuan per month since the trial started, according to the most recent data released by the People’s Bank of China. While that marks some progress following three years of trials, it’s still far from mounting a serious challenge to privately owned digital payment apps. Ant Group, which owns Alipay, revealed in 2020 stock exchange filings that the app processed $1.6 trillion on average each month — more than a thousand times the digital yuan’s monthly transaction volume at the time. Analysts have previously cited concerns about the reach of the government’s power and a lack of incentives as reasons for the lack of enthusiasm. After all, industry leaders Alipay and WeChat Pay already have hundreds of millions of users who are familiar with their services.

      What happens to buybuy BABY with Bed Bath & Beyond planning to go out of business
    ","America’s leading specialty baby products retailer will shutter its 120 stores, a consequence of parent company Bed Bath & Beyond’s bankruptcy filing on Sunday. buybuy BABY and its website will remain open for now, along with 360 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as the company secured a $240 million loan to help fund its operations during bankruptcy. Store closing sales will start Wednesday, as the company is using Chapter 11 proceedings to put itself up for sale. It said if it succeeds in finding a buyer, the company will “pivot away” from store closings. If a buyer does not appear for all or parts of its business, Bed Bath & Beyond will most likely be liquidated entirely and go out of business. Neil Saunders, a retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail, said Bed Bath & Beyond will be a “shadow of its former self” if it emerges from bankruptcy. “The buybuy BABY business is the one part of the operation that will probably attract interest from buyers,” Saunders said. Saunders said the former retail giant could move online only, but it could “mean reduced visibility and a much more difficult trading model from a profit perspective.” Bed Bath & Beyond acquired buybuy BABY for $67 million in 2007. At the time, the chain operated eight stores in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. The baby and toddler stores were founded in 1996 by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein, the sons of Bed Bath & Beyond’s co-founder. It was among the stores the firm acquired in the 2000s: Harmon Stores, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Cost Plus World Market. Bed Bath & Beyond placed some hope in buybuy BABY while it struggled to survive. Ryan Cohen, former activist investor in the company, said in a March 2022 letter that buybuy BABY was worth more than Bed Bath & Beyond’s entire market capitalization and should be considered to spun off or look to find a buyer to take the whole company private. Last year, Bed Bath & Beyond’s former CEO Mark Tritton said a bright spot in the company was its wedding and baby categories, noting an uptick in those sales in the beginning of 2022. Tritton was fired last June after only three years leading the sinking company. He joined Bed Bath & Beyond in 2019 from Target, where he was in charge of expanding its private label brands. Yet the company already closed five buybuy Baby locations earlier this year. In its bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond said it had $5.2 billion in debt and assets of just $4.4 billion.

      Tupperware has been struggling for years. Three charts show just how bad it’s been.
    ","Tupperware may be on the verge of collapse, but the 77-year-old business’ potential demise isn’t necessarily a harbinger of worsening economic conditions. While sales data shows the rest of the US consumer retail sector — including some of the company’s competitors in the food storage space — seems to be recovering from the pandemic dip, Tupperware sales continue to decline. Some business experts say that’s because Tupperware has failed to adapt to changing consumer behaviors. And now, faced with mounting debt, declining sales and plummeting stock prices, perhaps little can be done to save the company from bankruptcy. In a statement emailed to CNN, a Tupperware spokesperson said the brand has been affected by “the pandemic, inflation and high interest rates,” and is working with financial advisers and partnerships including Target and Amazon to strengthen the brand. “For over 75 years, Tupperware Brands has been one of the world’s most beloved, iconic household brands — and we are excited to remain at the heart of dining room tables, kitchen counters and pantry shelves for many more years to come,” the spokesperson said in the statement. The Tupperware brand name is so iconic that it’s become shorthand for all food leftover storage. That might be part of the problem, as other brands have emerged to compete against Tupperware, sometimes at lower price points. “A great brand name can be a blessing or a curse,” said Christie Nordhielm, a marketing consultant and adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “It’s a curse when you kind of rest on your laurels and milk the brand for profits and don’t continue to invest in a brand.” If you bought your “tupperware” in a store before October 2022, it was unlikely to be the actual brand. The company just introduced its products into Target stores last fall, a move that is likely, “way too little, too late,” said Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “At worst, it’s one of these things where their brand name is almost generic, and not in a good way,” Kahn said. “That doesn’t have to be a bad thing… People might call things Kleenex, but they know the difference,” she added. Tupperware has historically only sold to consumers through “direct sales,” most commonly at “Tupperware parties.” These parties were gatherings where people who enjoyed the product would demo and sell the Tupperware brand to their friends and acquaintances. That direct selling model worked well at first but fell out of favor as consumer habits changed in the decades preceding the pandemic, according to Kahn. The fact that Tupperware moved away from that direct sales model and into Target was an “admission” that their core business model wasn’t working, said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Business. While some businesses may have taken hits during the pandemic, Tupperware’s decline wasn’t sudden. “The company has gradually lost steam,” Calkins said. “It hasn’t gone off a cliff so much as over many years it’s just become weaker.” The pandemic, which affected most businesses negatively, just exacerbated those failures of Tupperware to adjust to changing consumer behaviors and competitive landscapes. “You could have seen them making that transition very beautifully, but instead they moved into brick and mortar stores,” Nordhielm explained. “If you go and look at Tupperware in a Target, all you’re doing is seeing how incredibly undifferentiated they are, how many other substitute storage containers there are available.” Instead, people tend to compare the products based on price, Kahn said, and Tupperware’s most valuable asset — its brand equity — loses all its meaning. Tupperware has also failed to innovate in response to these changes in competition and consumer behavior, Nordhielm said. As a result, Tupperware’s sales have been declining for years. Meanwhile the rest of the consumer retail sector is showing signs of recovery after the pandemic. At the worst of the pandemic, sales saw a stark decline, but they have been improving since, recovering more than 60 percent since their nadir in April 2020. “The state of the consumer remains relatively strong,” Hamilton said. “If a recession is in the cards, it’s not showing up yet in measures for the consumer sector.” But the recovery in sales doesn’t mean other retailers are immune to collapse. Calkins points out that financing remains tight, creating a challenge for businesses across the sector that face high debt burdens or need support for innovation. Tupperware may be an early casualty because it was already in a weak position. The brand had to restructure its debts in May 2020. “Sadly, I think this is not the last one of these stories we’re gonna hear,” Calkins said.

      This is when your blue Bed Bath & Beyond coupons will stop working
    ","After a tumultuous struggle to stay in business over the past several years, Bed Bath & Beyond declared bankruptcy on Sunday. That means your stash of its 20%-off coupons are about to be useless. Bed Bath & Beyond said it would sell off its merchandise and then go out of business. The company said customers will have Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to use their remaining 20%-off coupons. The company will stop accepting coupons on Wednesday. Instead, Bed Bath & Beyond expects to offer “deep discounts” on its products as part of its going-out-of-business sales. “Creditors wouldn’t want to allow shoppers to tack on those 20%-off coupons on top of 70% off liquidation prices,” said Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. The company encouraged shoppers to seek out its discounted merchandise later this week, but those sales come with big caveats: Items purchased before Wednesday can be returned until May 24, but all sales after Wednesday will be final. The store will stop accepting gift cards on May 8, and the brands Welcome Rewards points will stop being accepted on May 15. Bed Bath & Beyond said it will no longer award points to customers for purchases, starting Sunday. Bed Bath & Beyond, a staple of wedding registries for years, said customers who registered with Bed Bath & Beyond will eventually have their information transferred to a competitor’s service, where guests can purchase similar items. The company expects to notify customers about its registry plans in the coming days. Other retailers have followed a similar game plan after bankruptcy and store closings. Toys ‘R’ Us honored its gift cards, store credit and coupons for a 30-day period after it filed for bankruptcy in 2017, and subsequently liquidated its US business. The toy seller has since begun to attempt a comeback through a partnership with Macy’s, and opened its first post-bankruptcy store in 2019 under new ownership. It’s not just creditors who might take issue with the store honoring the coupons on top of liquidation discounts. The companies that sell the products wouldn’t want their merchandise knocked down so heavily, either. “For suppliers of name brands in particular, they wouldn’t want the deep discounting to negatively impact their brand image,” said Ali Besharat, associate professor of marketing and co-director of the Consumer Insights and Business Innovation Center at the University of Denver’s Daniels College of Business. Bed Bath & Beyond introduced its oversized coupon for 20% off a single item three decades ago. Over time, the oversized postcard-like mailer and digital coupon with an eye-popping purple-blue border and font blaring “20% off in-store or online” developed a cult following and became a successful marketing strategy to lure in repeat shoppers, said Flickinger. The “Big Blue” coupons became a pop culture reference as celebrities and late-night talk show hosts popped it into their on-air conversations. Rumors swirled on various social platforms that Big Blue coupons never expire, even though the weekly coupon does feature an expiration date. Then the pandemic hit and walloped the retail industry. With stores closed for months, and consumers rethinking their nonessential purchases, Bed Bath & Beyond sales and profit took a hit. In late 2020, the retailer said it was scaling back on its popular coupon program to boost its business. Two years later, company executives called the move a ‘big mistake,” admitting they had misjudged how much shoppers had come to embrace the regular cadence of the Big Blue coupons. Now that the company is going through a liquidation process, Bed Bath & Beyond said it’s the end of the road for the coupons. “Since the company no longer exists … the points would simply be useless,” said Chandan Jha, associate professor of finance at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, NY.

      Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging
    ","It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. “The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings. “The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.” Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. “This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone. “A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.” This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan. Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora
            
                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry. Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,
            
                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year. The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand. Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. “As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.” Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value. So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it. But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary. “As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.” ",888,business,2022-04-27,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html

      The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric
    ","General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning. Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. “Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance. GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.

      This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast
    ","Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram. There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms. The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance. We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it. BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year. As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life. It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see. The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms. The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.”  That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane. There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique. “Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.” That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you.  (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.) The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner. With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time. Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August. “What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government. Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms. “I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.” When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie. The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready. BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity. BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app. Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online. “I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says. Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives. “It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.” In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says. “BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,”  the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.” The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos. But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app. “There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says. “It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.” The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps. Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well. Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says. “For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says. “Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.” ",1185,business,2022-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/business/bereal-social-media-app-cec/index.html

      BMW reveals its new $120,000 electric flagship
    ","Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan. While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday. With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300. This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge. BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems. A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets. Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design. The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries. The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space. Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology. “There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists. Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back. As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space. BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked. Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard. The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night. For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times. The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode. A sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area. Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car. A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react. BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030. ",1223,business,2022-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/bmw-i7/index.html

      Cold weather testing: Airplanes endure punishing extremes
    ","With extremely cold temperatures gripping much of the United States, travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying. The short answer: Along with regular deicing of planes before take-off, airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service. CNN has previously followed a team of Airbus engineers, mechanics and test pilots. Their mission was to see how their test plane, a long-range A350 XWB, withstood extreme cold. The Airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their Toulouse, France, base to perform various extreme-weather trials on the test plane in frigid Iqaluit, the capital of Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut. The ground and in-air tests included operating the A350 XWB in temperatures reaching down to  -18 Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius), thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test. All new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions, from freezing to intense heat. “Coming to an extreme place means we can break everything,” Airbus’ head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters. Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways. Metals, such as steel and aluminum, contract at different rates. Lubricants may lose their viscosity, creating friction and wear issues for moving parts. Meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle. The cold-weather tests in Canada came only days after the MSN3 test plane completed high-altitude test in Bolivia. Next stop was Qatar for hot-weather testing. For years Iqaluit, located on Baffin Island, has marketed itself as “a premier cold-weather test site.” Airbus has tested there since the 1990s, while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as Boeing, Dassault and Eurocopter to perform similar trials. But cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places. In April 2010, Boeing chose McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme-weather testing on its 787 Dreamliner. In a test chamber the aircraft was given a “cold soak” and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit (-42.7 degrees Celsius) for hours. Later, it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), also for hours. “These tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe (and in all seasons),” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a news release. But extreme-weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of Mother Nature. Initially scheduled for five days, Airbus’ tests in Iqaluit were cut short, not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees Celsius – too warm for the cold weather testing.

      In less than a week, Sam Bankman-Fried’s $16 billion fortune evaporated
    ","Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out. Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.” FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive. The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing. He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry. Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans. As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt. On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.” ",318,business,2022-11-11,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/sbf-wealth/index.html

      Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy
    ","In the space of a week, a 30-year-old entrepreneur once hailed as a modern-day J.P. Morgan watched his digital empire, including billions of his own fortune, evaporate in a death spiral that’s shaken the foundations of the trillion-dollar crypto industry. On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried issued a mea culpa: “I f**ked up,” he wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread, apologizing to investors and customers of FTX, the exchange platform he founded in 2019. By Friday morning, FTX said Bankman-Fried had resigned as CEO and that the firm was filing for bankruptcy. Failures are not uncommon in the murky, largely unregulated world of crypto, but FTX is not your average crypto startup. Its near-collapse this week represents a potential turning point for an industry that many critics say has been given a pass for far too long. So, what happened to FTX, and why is the entire crypto space freaking out about it? There are still a lot of uncertainties, but here’s what we know. Last week, the crypto news website CoinDesk published an article based on a leaked financial document from Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research. The report suggested that Alameda’s business rested on shaky financial footing. Namely, that the bulk of its assets are held in FTT, a digital token minted by Alameda’s sister firm, FTX. That was a red flag for investors, as the companies were, on paper at least, separate. Alameda’s disproportionate holdings of the token, however, suggested the two were much more closely linked. On Sunday, the CEO of Binance, FTX’s much larger rival, said his company was liquidating $580 million worth of FTX holdings. That set off a firestorm of draw downs that FTX didn’t have the cash to facilitate. By Monday, concerns about Alameda and FTX had bled into the broader crypto market. But Bankman-Fried was defiant, tweeting that FTX and its assets were “fine.” He also sparred with the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, whose tweet had fueled the run on FTX deposits. There was clearly bad blood between the two, which is why it shocked the industry when the pair announced a tentative deal Tuesday for Binance to bail out FTX. “This afternoon, FTX asked for our help,” Zhao tweeted that afternoon, noting that there was a “significant liquidity crunch” at the company and that Binance would have to conduct corporate due diligence before going forward with any deal. Almost immediately after getting a look at under the hood, though, Binance began to backtrack. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried’s personal fortune also tumbled. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Bankman-Fried’s net worth cratered 94% in a single day, from more than $15 billion to just under $1 billion — the biggest one-day loss ever clocked by the index. (The estimate of his wealth was based on the assumption that Binance would ultimately bail out FTX, where much of Bankman-Fried’s personal assets are held. Which means his net worth may have farther to fall.) On Wednesday, cryptocurrencies continued to slump as investor anxiety about the FTX bailout spread. Bitcoin and ether, the two most popular tokens, both hit their lowest level in two years. The selloff deepened after media reports emerged that Binance was leaning toward walking away from the deal. Sure enough, on Wednesday afternoon, Zhao tweeted a withering assessment of FTX’s problems: “In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.” He also alluded to allegations of “mishandled funds” and investigations by US regulators. Binance was out. FTX’s best shot at a lifeline was gone. The full extent of FTX’s financial problems aren’t yet known, but multiple reports say the firm is facing an $8 billion shortfall. Without a quick infusion of equity, Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors Thursday, the firm was facing bankruptcy. Since the Binance deal fell apart, Bankman-Fried has been scrambling to raise funds. On Thursday, tweeted that there were “a number of players” the firm was in talks with. “We’re spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity,” he wrote in his apology thread. “Every penny” of that, plus the remaining collateral, will go toward making users whole, followed by investors and employees.” Despite its reputation as a dependable, low-risk investment portal, FTX’s business appears to have been built on a complex, extremely risky kind of leveraged trading. Customers deposited their money to engage in crypto trading. But it appears that FTX instead took billions of dollars worth of that money and loaned it out to its sister firm, Alameda, to fund those high-risk bets, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine put it another way: “FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless.” At the end of the day, FTX experienced the crypto equivalent of a classic bank run. Customers wanted their money out, and FTX didn’t have it. In traditional finance, customers’ funds are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits. The FDIC does not insure stocks or cryptocurrencies, however, leaving the fate of FTX’s customers and investors in question. One of those investors was the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, which said it invested $95 million in both FTX International and its US entity “to gain small-scale exposure to an emerging area in the financial technology sector.” In a statement Thursday, the plan noted that any loss on its investment would have “limited impact” as it represents less than 0.05% of its total net assets. After a chaotic week, FTX filed for bankruptcy. In a statement, FTX said John Ray III has been appointed the new CEO and that many exchange employees are expected to stay on to run the firm as it goes through the Chapter 11 process. Ray said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to “assess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.” Regulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong at FTX, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown. Securities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, froze some of the embattled exchange’s assets on Thursday. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, according to the Wall Street Journal. (The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.) The collapse of FTX is “a loud warning bell that cryptocurrencies can fail,” Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. “And just like we saw with over-the-counter derivatives that led to a financial crisis, these failures can have a ripple effect on consumers and other parts of our financial system.” ",1123,business,2022-11-10,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-collapse/index.html

      Amazon workers in California withdraw petition for union vote after defeat in New York
    ","Six months after the grassroots Amazon Labor Union scored a historic victory by becoming the first to unionize one of the tech giant’s US facilities, it now appears to be grappling with setbacks and delays. Workers at a California Amazon facility withdrew their petition late last week to unionize with the ALU, just days after the labor group failed to win enough votes to unionize an Amazon facility in upstate New York. Kayla Blado, a spokesperson for the National Labor Relations Board, confirmed to CNN Business on Tuesday that the petition for a union election at the ONT8 facility in Moreno Valley, California, had been withdrawn. Blado added that the petitioner does not have to provide a reason to the NLRB for doing so. The move to withdraw comes roughly two weeks after the petition was submitted, per the NLRB’s docket of the case. In an email to CNN Business, ALU President Chris Smalls played down the significance of the withdrawn petition. “The withdrawal isn’t nothing to worry about,” he said. “We will be refilling within the next few weeks just as we did with our JFK8 campaign,” Smalls added, referring to the name of the unionized facility in Staten Island, New York. Smalls did not offer a reason for the decision to withdraw and potentially refile the petition. Since the watershed union win at JFK8, the ALU hasn’t seen success with organizing efforts at other Amazon facilities. In addition to the Amazon workers near Albany voting against joining the union last week, the ALU also failed to win enough votes to unionize a smaller Amazon outpost in Staten Island. Moreover, Amazon has refused to recognize or meet with the union at JFK8 — and continues to challenge the union’s election win. Labor experts say the saga reveals how difficult it is to organize a union under current labor laws. Amazon has long maintained that it prefers working with employees directly, versus through a union. After the workers near Albany voted against forming a union, an Amazon spokesperson said the company is “glad” to see “they chose to keep the direct relationship with Amazon as we think that this is the best arrangement for both our employees and customers.” Despite the uphill battle the union faces, Smalls previously told CNN Business that he sees the increase in organizing efforts at Amazon facilities across the country as its own victory. “The expansion of the ALU is definitely historical by itself,” Smalls said. He added that the group has been fielding an explosion of interest from Amazon workers across the country since the ALU’s original win in Staten Island in April.

      What is mifepristone, the drug at the heart of the Texas medication abortion lawsuit?
    ","The US Supreme Court stayed a ruling by a federal judge in Texas to suspend the approval of mifepristone, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that has been shown to be safe and effective for more than two decades. The lawsuit from anti-abortion advocates claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn’t study it enough to approve it. Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery. Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it’s sometimes known as RU 486. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period. This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show. Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country’s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, which signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone’s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show. Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra – used to treat erectile dysfunction – is nearly 10 times higher. Mifepristone usually doesn’t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA. Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are “exceedingly rare,” happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations’ amicus brief. The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Preliminary data published February 2022 from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, showed that medication abortion accounted for 53% of all abortions in the US. No matter the status of mifepristone, misoprostol would still be available and could be used for a medication abortion on its own. The only use of misoprostol that’s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it “off-label” by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor. Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a “reasonable” option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective. This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization. People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, said Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Massachusetts and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Misoprostol still works very well and is very safe,” Wong said. “Mifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.” ",783,health,2023-03-15,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/health/mifepristone-what-is-it/index.html

      How safe is the abortion pill compared with other common drugs
    ","The Supreme Court on Friday protected access to a widely used abortion drug by freezing lower-court rulings that placed restrictions on its usage. A federal judge in Texas previously ruled to suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process, siding with the coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations that filed the lawsuit. Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That’s a death rate of 0.0005%. Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin — a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia — is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra — used to treat erectile dysfunction — is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA. The Justice Department, the FDA, and Danco — a manufacturer of mifepristone that intervened in the case — have appealed the ruling . “[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. “Its safety is very well established.” Within hours of the decision in Texas, a federal judge in Washington state issued a conflicting ruling that the federal government must keep mifepristone available in the 17 Democrat-led states and the District of Columbia that had sued in a separate lawsuit. If the Texas ruling is allowed to take effect, 40 million more women of reproductive age would lose access to medication abortion care around the country, according to data from abortion rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. That’s in addition to the 24.5 million women of reproductive age living in states with abortion bans. “The court’s disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation,” said Dr. Jack Resneck, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, in a statement. “By rejecting medical facts, the court has intruded into the exam room and has intervened in decisions that belong to patients and physicians.” Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion. “It reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,” she said. It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications — like hemorrhages or infections — for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a 2015 study conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications. The likelihood of serious complications via procedural abortion — performed second-trimester or later — is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And childbirth by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%. If access to mifepristone is cut off, abortion clinics and telehealth organizations could pivot to misoprostol-only abortions, Aiken told CNN. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said. In the latest study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol. Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen. “It’s clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,” said Aiken. Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it’s readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN. However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions. “It’s possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,” said Upadhyay. “Then by the time they get back to the clinic, they’re seeking abortion later in pregnancy.” Before the ruling, 19 states already restricted telehealth abortion care, limiting access to medication abortion. Nearly half of US adults were unsure whether medication abortion was currently legal in their state as of late-January, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Experts say that confusion will only be exacerbated. “People are not going to be sure mifepristone or misoprostol in fact, is available. I think it’s going to be confusing,” said Aiken. “As people look around for options or feel unsure about their options, they may end up delaying [care].” ",929,health,2023-03-15,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/health/abortion-pill-safety-dg/index.html

      Narcan nasal spray maker aims for over-the-counter price of less than $50
    ","Emergent, the maker of the opioid overdose antidote Narcan, said in a statement Thursday that it is aiming for an out-of-pocket price of less than $50 for its nasal spray product now that the US Food and Drug Administration allows for over-the-counter sales. Public interest groups such as government agencies, nonprofits and first responders pay less than $50, on average, for a kit of two 4-milligram doses, the company says. The wholesale price is $125 per kit. “A goal for the out-of-pocket retailer price is to be consistent with our public interest pricing … although retail price is set by individual retailers.” In an April 6 letter to Emergent, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked the company to respond by Thursday with “the affordable OTC Narcan list price that your company intends to set.” “Currently, your product is reported as having a wholesale price as high as $120 for two doses, with significant variation in price depending on location and insurance coverage. Individuals without insurance – about one fifth of people with opioid use disorder are uninsured – will be forced to bear the full cost. Even individuals with insurance and low co-pays can struggle to afford Narcan,” he wrote. “I ask you to commit to work with public health experts, addiction specialists, and community activists to develop and determine a list price for OTC Narcan that makes it affordable and accessible for those who need it most.” In a response letter Thursday, Emergent emphasized the importance of continued federal funding for substance abuse treatment and prevention programs, including opioid response initiatives that distribute Narcan, and for private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid to consider their coverage of the medication. Emergent aims to have Narcan available online and in stores by late summer. Harm-reduction experts have said the price of naloxone, the overdose antidote medication in Narcan, has inhibited its accessibility for people who need it most and will probably still be out of reach for many, despite a potential price drop with OTC availability. Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy, said when the FDA approved OTC naloxone last month that the administration is asking Emergent to keep the price low. “We’ve got to make sure that these life-saving medications, as well as treatment, is accessible across no matter where you live, rural or urban, rich or poor,” he said. Narcan works by blocking the effects of opioids on the brain and restoring breathing. For the most effectiveness, it must be given as soon as signs of overdose appear. The drug works on someone only if there are opioids in their system. It won’t work on any other type of drug overdose, but it won’t have adverse effects if given to someone who hasn’t taken opioids. Each kit contains two doses in case the person overdosing does not respond to the first dose. However, Emergent says most overdoses can be reversed with a single dose. The product can be administered to anyone, even children and babies. More than a million people have died of drug overdoses in the two decades since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collecting that data. Many of those deaths were due to opioids. Deaths from opioid overdoses rose more than 17% in just one year, from about 69,000 in 2020 to about 81,020 in 2021, the CDC found. Opioid deaths are the leading cause of accidental death in the US. Most are among adults, but children are also dying, largely after ingesting synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Between 1999 and 2016, nearly 9,000 children and adolescents died of opioid poisoning, with the highest annual rates among adolescents 15 to 19, the CDC says. About 1.2 million doses of naloxone were dispensed by retail pharmacies in 2021, according to data published by the American Medical Association – nearly nine times more than were dispensed five years earlier.

      The cost of senior care is rising while caregivers are ‘drowning’ without help
    ","For most of her life, Tammy La Barbera has been taking care of someone other than herself. First, it was her two children. Then, it was her brother and father, who both died after being diagnosed with cancer. Now, Tammy is taking care of her 90-year-old mother, Ada, who was diagnosed with dementia five years ago. In recent months, Ada’s condition deteriorated so quickly that Tammy resigned from her job as an event manager to become a full-time caregiver. “I don’t have help here, and I know it’s going to get worse,” she said. Tammy, 53, struggles to provide her mother with the care she needs and would like to place her in a memory care facility equipped to handle the mood swings and outbursts that her mother has due to her condition. But Tammy says she doesn’t expect to ever have enough money to pay for that care. Recently, she said, she looked into an assisted living facility near her home in Murrieta, California. She says placing her mother at the facility – or others like it – would cost between $7,000 and $10,000 a month out-of-pocket. Across the country, millions of caregivers like Tammy are looking after a loved one – a relative or a friend. About 53 million US adults are caregivers, according to a 2020 report from AARP. Sixty-three percent of US caregivers who look after adults said the person they were looking after needed care because of “long-term physical conditions,” the report says. Since her mother’s diagnosis, Tammy’s life has been turned upside-down. Ada cannot bathe herself or cook for herself. Most days, she doesn’t even remember who her daughter is. “All her daily duties are done by me,” Tammy said, caring for her mother all day is like being a prisoner in her own home. Sooner or later, she said, she will have to move her mother to a long-term care facility and do whatever she can to pay for it. “I know that I’m reaching a crossroads with my mom’s care, and I’m trying to do this as long as I can,” Tammy said. “But I know the way things are going, and if she’s progressing pretty rapidly, I’m not going to have a choice.” Ada La Barbera was a teacher for 20 years, so she gets a pension check each month. Tammy puts that money, along with her mother’s monthly Social Security checks, toward bills. It’s just over $3,300 a month, and along with Tammy’s dwindling savings, it’s barely enough to keep them afloat, Tammy says. She can barely afford her rent. It’s because of her financial struggles that Tammy has been putting off long-term care for her mother. Where Tammy and Ada live in California, a home health aide would cost about $137 for one hour of care, according to an online calculator from AARP. “When you’re on a fixed income, you can’t afford that,” Tammy said. “So I don’t have the luxury to do that.” A long-term care facility is even more expensive. On average, it costs $10,830 a month to stay at a nursing home and $5,806 per month for an assisted living facility, according to the nonprofit National Investment Center for Senior Housing and Care. Then there is memory care, where Tammy says her mother belongs. Memory care facilities are the fastest-growing sector of the senior housing market, according to the National Investment Center. On average, memory care costs just over $7,500 a month, center COO Chuck Harry says. These facilities offer more hands-on care for people with dementia. They can include special features like locked units that prevent wandering patients from leaving the facility unattended and enclosed outdoor spaces where patients can move about safely. A nurse comes to see Ada at home every other week. During that 40-minute visit, Ada’s vitals are checked, and her medications are adjusted. Those visits are covered by Medicare, Tammy says. Medicare is a medical health insurance program that is for people 65 years or older. But Medicare does not cover the cost of a long-term care facility. And although Ada and Tammy are on a fixed income, Ada doesn’t qualify for other federal safety net programs like Medicaid because Tammy says they are not considered low-income. For middle-income families, Medicaid goes into effect only after a family has gone through the process of “spending down” their assets until they qualify for the program. “That is usually the path of anyone going into a nursing home for the long term: spending your own money – which is all out of pocket – and then reaching a Medicaid level of eligibility,” said Susan Reinhard, senior vice president and director of the AARP Public Policy Institute, noting that each state has its own Medicaid program and process. Until a family qualifies for Medicaid, the program will only cover the medical costs of a stay at a long-term facility, not room and board. Caroline Pearson, the lead author of a landmark 2019 demographic study called “The Forgotten Middle,” says most middle-income Americans find themselves in a position where they are too “wealthy” to receive Medicaid coverage for long-term care services but too “poor” to afford the out-of-pocket costs of that care. So why does putting a loved one in a nursing home or an assisted living facility cost so much? Providing long-term care services is expensive, Pearson says, adding that the senior housing industry requires a large workforce of nurses and staff to support it. That is also expensive. Additionally, as seniors sell their homes and move into these facilities, long-term care facilitators are essentially providing housing, she said. And housing is not cheap. The senior housing industry also caters to a high-income population, according to Pearson, who is now executive director of the Peterson Center on Healthcare. “The fit and finish at the buildings … [residents] expect to be really high-end. The amount of amenities and services that are part of that senior housing property … they expect to be high-end,” she said. “The market has seen good returns and then replicated that model.” And the demand for high-quality, long-term care is only expected to go up as the baby boomer generation continues to age, according to Pearson. “Most people don’t begin to need long-term care services until between 75 and 85. And so as the baby boomers hit those ages, that is where we’re going to see that demand really explode,” she said. According to the US Census Bureau, baby boomers – people born from 1946 to 1964 – will all be over the age of 65 by 2030. The oldest members of that generation will be 84 at that point. In 2019, there were about 8 million middle-income seniors – people 75 and older – living in the United States, Pearson says in her study. She projects that there will be 14.4 million middle-income seniors in the US by 2029, with 60% expected to have mobility limitations and 20% expected to have “high health care and functional needs.” “We are going to [have] double the number of middle-income seniors when the baby boomers age,” Pearson said. “Fewer of those baby boomers are going to have spouses or children who live nearby to provide unpaid caregiving support.” Most family caregivers are spouses or middle-age daughters, the study notes. At the end of the day, Pearson says, many Americans don’t think about aging until it’s staring them in the face. “People [think] that they will live healthy and independently until they die, and sadly, that’s just statistically very unlikely for most people,” she said. Tammy says her family thought they were prepared for the future. In 1965, Ada married Tammy’s father, Peter “Jazz” La Barbera, an accountant. “My dad was a very, very good saver, and he did have a little bit of savings,” Tammy said. “He was set just for the future, not for anything unexpected.” In 1970, Tammy was born in Queens. She and her older brother, Peter Jr., grew up an hour outside New York City. “We had a small house, and we lived in that house our whole lives, and … we were the perfect family,” Tammy said. She eventually moved to California, where she had two kids. Her parents followed, along with her brother and his wife. But soon after the move, Peter Jr. was diagnosed with cancer, and he died a year later. Two years after that, Tammy’s father received a cancer diagnosis and died within seven weeks. Tammy believes that the physical and financial toll of taking care of her son and husband kickstarted her mother’s health problems. Shortly after her husband died, Ada had a minor stroke and was diagnosed with dementia. “It’s almost like her grief was so overwhelming. Especially losing her son. I don’t think her brain had the capacity to deal with anything else anymore,” Tammy said. The stress associated with taking care of a loved one full-time, or even part-time, can have negative consequences, research has shown. Some of the physical symptoms associated with taking care of someone with dementia include higher levels of depression and anxiety, worse self-reported physical health, compromised immune function and increased risk of early death, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Over half (53%) of caregivers indicate that a decline in their health compromises their ability to provide care, according to the CDC. “I have sacrificed 10 years of my life being a caretaker, and I don’t have a life,” Tammy said. “It’s an honor to take care of my mother. But doing this every single day … it’s a lot.” Tammy is preparing for her own future by taking part in genetic testing that will tell her whether she is more likely to develop dementia like her mother. “I would like to prepare as much as I can, whether it’s medication or adjusting my life,” she said. “I just don’t want to put my kids through this.” She would also like to see changes to the system. Pearson says the solution to the cost issue is not simple and will probably be resolved only through a combination of incremental Medicaid expansion, changes to the senior housing industry and federal subsidies. AARP’s Reinhard says tax credits for family caregivers could help people like Tammy get a break. Employers could also help by supporting workers who need to stop working to care for a family member or friend. In September, the US Department of Health and Human Services, through its Administration for Community Living, announced a national strategy aimed at supporting family caregivers, highlighting nearly 350 actions the federal government will take. The strategy also includes 150 actions that it says local governments, communities and private businesses can adopt to help build a more supportive system. “Supporting family caregivers is an urgent public health issue, exacerbated by the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a news release. “This national strategy recognizes the critical role family caregivers play in a loved one’s life.” Gal Wettstein, a senior research economist for the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, says it would be beneficial for middle-income Americans to speak to a financial adviser as early as possible and transfer assets to a family member if they think they might need to enter a long-term care facility in the near future. This way, if their only option is to spend down their assets to become eligible for Medicaid, they hit that eligibility sooner. Long-term care insurance is another option, but experts say it’s rarely sold anymore because it is typically more expensive than other kinds of insurance. Pearson says Americans can plan ahead by investing in long-term care insurance in their 40s for it to benefit them when they will most likely need it, in their 80s. Wettstein also recommends long-term care insurance. “[Long-term care insurance] plans are getting harder and harder to sign, but they do still exist. Some insurers will still sell them,” he said. Ultimately, covering the cost of senior care comes down to families and how much they save for the future, until changes are made by senior housing providers and policy makers. “We are so far away from having any sort of swift and universal solution,” Pearson said. For now, Ada is on a waitlist for a spot at a skilled-nursing home about an hour from where they live. If she moves there, her cost of living might be partially covered through a Medicaid program. Tammy was told that Ada is one of more than 2,000 people waiting for a spot. “We’re drowning. We’re care workers, and we’re drowning,” Tammy said. “We don’t have help.” ",2109,health,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/health/senior-care-cost/index.html

      Suicides and suicide attempts by poisoning rose sharply among children and teens during the pandemic
    ","The rate of suspected suicides and suicide attempts by poisoning among young people rose sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic, a new study says. Among children 10 to 12 years old, the rate increased more than 70% from 2019 to 2021. The analysis, published Thursday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, looked at what the National Poison Data System categorized as “suspected suicides” by self-poisoning for 2021 among people ages 10 to 19; the records included both suicide attempts and deaths by suicide. The data showed that attempted suicides and suicides by poisoning increased 30% in 2021 compared with 2019, before the pandemic began. Younger children, ages 10 to 12, had the biggest increase at 73%. For 13- to 15-year-olds, there was a 48.8% increase in suspected suicides and attempts by poisoning from 2019 to 2021. Girls seemed to be the most affected, with a 36.8% increase in suspected suicides and attempts by poisoning. “I think the group that really surprised us was the 10- to 12-year-old age group, where we saw a 73% increase, and I can tell you that from my clinical practice, this is what we’re seeing also,” said study co-author Dr. Chris Holstege, professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics chief at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “We’re seeing very young ages ages that I didn’t used to see attempting suicide by poisoning. “It was pretty stunning from our perspective,” he said. Twenty or so years ago, when he started working at the University of Virginia, he said, they rarely treated anyone ages 9 to 12 for suicide by poisoning. Now, it’s every week. “This is an aberration that’s fairly new in our practice,” Holstege said. The records showed that many of the children used medicines that would be commonly found around the house, including acetaminophen, ibuprofen and diphenhydramine, which is sold under brand names including Benadryl. There was a 71% jump from 2019 to 2021 in attempts at suicide using acetaminophen alone, Holstege said. The choice of over-the-counter medications is concerning because children typically have easy access to these products, and they often come in large quantities. Holstege encourages caregivers to keep all medications in lock boxes, even the seemingly innocuous over-the-counter ones. If a child overdoses on something like acetaminophen or diphenhydramine, Holstege encourages parents to bring their children into the hospital without delay, because the toxicity of the drug worsens over time.  It’s also a good idea to call a poison center, a confidential resource that is available around the clock. “We want to make sure that the children are taken care of in regards to their mental health but also in regards to the poisoning if there’s suspicion that they took an overdose,” he said. There were limitations to the data used in the new study. It captured only the number of families or institutions that reached out to the poison control line; it cannot account for those who attempted suicide by means other than poison. It also can’t capture exactly how many children or families sought help from somewhere other than poison control, so the increase in suspected suicides could be higher. The American Academy of Pediatrics has noted that the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated existing mental health struggles that existed even. In 2021, the group called child and adolescent mental health a “national emergency.” Emergency room clinicians across the country have also said they’ve seen  record numbers of children with mental health crises, including attempts at suicide. In 2020, suicide was the second leading cause of death among children ages 10 to 14 and the third leading cause among those 15 to 24, according to the CDC. Although the height of the pandemic is over, kids are still emotionally vulnerable, experts warn. Previous attempts at suicide have been found to be the “strongest predictor of subsequent death by suicide,” the study said. “An urgent need exists to strengthen programs focused on identifying and supporting persons at risk for suicide, especially young persons,” the study said. Research has shown that there is a significant shortage of trained professionals and treatment facilities that can address the number of children who need better mental health care.  In August, the Biden administration announced a plan to make it easier for millions of kids to get access to mental and physical health services at school. At home, experts said, families should constantly check in with children to see how they are doing emotionally. Caregivers also need to make sure they restrict access to “lethal means,” like keeping medicines – even over-the-counter items – away from children and keeping guns locked up. Dr. Aron Janssen, vice chair of clinical affairs at the Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Lurie Children’s in Chicago, said he is not surprised to see the increase in suspected suicides, “but it doesn’t make it any less sad.” Janssen, who did not work on the new report, called the increase “alarming.” The rates of suicide attempts among kids had been increasing even prior to the pandemic, he said, “but this shows Covid really supercharged this as a phenomenon. “We see a lot of kids who lost access to social supports increasingly isolated and really struggling to manage through day to day.” Janssen said that he and his colleagues believe these suspected suicides coincide with increased rates of depression and anxiety and a sense of real dread about the future. One of the biggest concerns is that “previous suicide attempts is the biggest predictor of later suicide completion,” he said. “We really want to follow these kids over time to better understand how to support them, to make sure that we’re doing everything within our power to help steer them away from future attempts.” Janssen said it’s important to keep in mind that the vast majority of children survived even the worst of the pandemic and did quite well. There are treatments that work, and kids who can get connected to the appropriate care – including talk therapy and, in some cases, medication – can and do get better. “We do see that. We do see improvement. We do see efficacy of our care,” Janssen said. “We just have to figure out how we can connect kids to care.” ",1045,health,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/health/suicide-poisoning-children-pandemic/index.html

      Using marijuana may affect your ability to think and plan, study says
    ","Remember those classic stoner dudes — Cheech and Chong, anyone? — spending their days in a weed-drenched room (or car), capable of little besides finding that next great high? If you don’t, that’s not surprising. As more and more states move to legalize marijuana, the stereotypical mind-numbing effects of weed have become passé, often replaced by an acceptance of the drug as an acceptable way to socialize, relax and get better sleep. But while society may have forgotten the impact that weed can have on the brain, science has not. Studies have long shown that getting high can harm cognitive function. A January 2022 review of research, published in the journal Addiction, finds that impact may last well beyond the initial high, especially for adolescents. “Our study enabled us to highlight several areas of cognition impaired by cannabis use, including problems concentrating and difficulties remembering and learning, which may have considerable impact on users’ daily lives,” said coauthor Dr. Alexandre Dumais, associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal. “Cannabis use in youth may consequently lead to reduced educational attainment, and, in adults, to poor work performance and dangerous driving. These consequences may be worse in regular and heavy users,” Dumais said. Weed’s impact on the brain can be particularly detrimental to cognitive development for youth, whose brains are still developing, said Dr. Megan Moreno, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, who was not involved in the study. “This study provides strong evidence for negative cognitive effects of cannabis use, and should be taken as critical evidence to prioritize prevention of cannabis use in youth,” Moreno said. “And contrary to the time of Cheech and Chong, we now know that the brain continues to develop through age 25. “Parents should be aware that adolescents using cannabis are at risk for damage to their most important organ, their brain.” The January 2022 review looked at studies on over 43,000 people and found a negative impact of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, on the brain’s higher levels of thinking. Those executive functions include the ability to make decisions, remember important data, plan, organize and solve problems, as well as control emotions and behavior. Can you recover or reverse those deficits? Scientists aren’t sure. “Research has revealed that THC is a fat-soluble compound that may be stored in body fat and, thus, gradually released into the bloodstream for months,” Dumais said, adding that high-quality research is needed to establish the long-term impact of that exposure. Some studies say the negative effects on the brain may ease after weed is discontinued, but that may also depend on the amount, frequency and years of marijuana use. The age in which weed use began may also play a role, if it falls within the crucial developmental period of the youthful brain. “Thus far, the most consistent alterations produced by cannabis use, mostly its chronic use, during youth have been observed in the prefrontal cortex,” Dumais said. “Such alterations may potentially lead to a long-term disruption of cognitive and executive functions.” In addition, some studies have shown that “early and frequent cannabis use in adolescence predicts poor cognition in adulthood,” he added. While science sorts this out, “preventive and interventional measures to educate youths on cannabis use and discourage them from using the substance in a chronic manner should be considered … since youths remain particularly susceptible to the effects of cannabis,” Dumais said.

      On ‘weed day,’ our medical analyst urges caution on recreational marijuana use
    ","As some people mark 4/20 as “weed day,” a day of celebration of marijuana use, I don’t want to bum you out — but I might. Over the past decade, there has been a trend toward legalizing marijuana in the United States. Currently, at least 37 states, plus Washington, DC, have a comprehensive medical cannabis program. A growing number of states, currently at 21, have legalized recreational marijuana use. I wanted to learn about the research around marijuana use, including the effects it has on the user and the medicinal uses for cannabis. I turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who has many concerns about recreational cannabis use, especially for certain populations such as young people and pregnant people. Wen, who urged users and would-be users to be cautious, is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner and as chair of Behavioral Health System Baltimore, where she oversaw policy and services around substances that can cause addiction, including marijuana. CNN: What are the physiological effects of marijuana? Dr. Leana Wen: Marijuana is a plant that has many active ingredients. One of the principal ones is a psychoactive compound called tetrahydrocannabinol. Often called THC, it’s similar to compounds that are naturally occurring in the body called cannabinoids and can mimic their function by attaching to cannabinoid receptors in the brain. In so doing, THC can disrupt normal mental and physical functions, including memory, concentration, movement and coordination. Using marijuana can cause impaired thinking and interfere with someone’s ability to learn, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Smoking cannabis can also impair the function of the parts of the brain that regulate balance, posture and reaction time. And THC stimulates the neurons involved in the reward system that release dopamine, or the “feel-good” brain chemical, which contributes to its addictive potential. CNN: Marijuana is thought to have some positive and medicinal benefits. How can it be used for therapeutic purposes? Wen: Short-term, many users report pleasant feelings, including happiness and relaxation. As a result, some people use marijuana to self-treat anxiety or depression. This is not a recommended use. What often ends up happening is that the person develops tolerance, requiring more and more of the drug to get the same effect. There are some approved medicinal uses of marijuana for very specific indications. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved THC-based medications that are prescribed in pill form for treatment of nausea in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and to stimulate appetite in patients with AIDS. There are several marijuana-based medications that are undergoing clinical trials for conditions like neuropathic pain, overactive bladder and muscle stiffness. I think it’s really important for these and many more studies to continue. Researchers should continue to look not just at marijuana itself but its specific chemical components, since botanicals in their natural form can contain hundreds of active chemicals and obtaining the correct dosages may be challenging. In the meantime, users should use caution in evaluating supposed medicinal claims and clearly understand the risks of cannabis use. CNN: What are the risks of marijuana use, and who may be particularly vulnerable to them? Wen: The main concern about marijuana use is its impact on the developing brain. As the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states on its website, “Marijuana affects brain development. Developing brains, such as those in babies, children, and teenagers, are particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol.” Numerous studies have linked marijuana use in women during pregnancy to a variety of cognitive and behavioral problems in their children. The CDC even warns against secondhand marijuana smoke exposure, and it also encourages breastfeeding individuals to avoid marijuana use. Marijuana affects young people throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Much research has shown how marijuana use in childhood impacts memory, attention, learning and motivation. Regular cannabis use in adolescence is associated with higher likelihood of not completing high school and even lower IQ later in life. The negative impacts persist beyond the teen years. Some studies of university students have found that the regularity of marijuana use is correlated with lower grade point average in college. I want to emphasize here that there is still a lot that we don’t know about the effects of marijuana, in particular long-term consequences. A recent study found that in adults, daily use of regular marijuana can increase the risk of coronary artery disease by as much as one-third. That’s the point, though; all the unknowns are exactly why I and many other clinicians and scientists urge caution. To be clear, there are many reasons to support policy changes of decriminalizing marijuana, including to rectify the decades-long injustices of disproportionately incarcerating minority individuals for marijuana possession. However, supporting decriminalization should not be equated with believing that marijuana is totally safe. It’s not. Marijuana has the potential to cause real and lasting harm, especially to young people. CNN: Could someone become addicted to marijuana? Wen: Yes. There is a condition known as marijuana use disorder. Signs of this disorder include trying but failing to quit using marijuana;, continuing to use it even though it is causing problems at home, school or work;, and using marijuana in high-risk situations, including while driving. Some individuals, especially those who use large amounts, experience withdrawal symptoms when they try to stop. As many as 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have marijuana use disorder, according to the CDC. The risk of developing marijuana use disorder is greater among those who use it more frequently and for those who started earlier in life. CNN: Some people say that marijuana is no big deal, especially in comparison with other substances like alcohol and opioids. Would you agree that cannabis use is at least better than using those substances? Wen: I wouldn’t frame it that way. It is true that marijuana doesn’t cause liver damage the way that high amounts of alcohol does, and it doesn’t have the lethality of opioids. If an adult is using marijuana once in a while, and not while driving, it’s probably not going to have lasting consequences. However, there are harms associated with more frequent use of marijuana and in particular its use in children. In my opinion, the legalization movement has shifted the conversation so much towards acceptance of cannabis that we are neglecting the fact that it is a drug and, I believe, should be regulated just like alcohol, tobacco and opioids. There should also be much more messaging and education so that people, including young people and their parents or guardians, can be aware of the harms of marijuana — just as they are aware of the harms of other drugs.

      SpaceX’s Starship rocket lifts off for inaugural test flight but explodes midair
    ","SpaceX’s Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, took off from a launchpad in South Texas at 9:33 a.m. ET Thursday but exploded midair before stage separation. Thursday’s launch marked the vehicle’s historic first test flight. “As if the flight test was not exciting enough, Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation,” SpaceX tweeted. The massive Super Heavy rocket booster, which houses 33 engines, lifted off and sent a massive boom across the coastal landscape as it fired to life. The Starship spacecraft, riding atop the booster, soared out over the Gulf of Mexico. About 2½ minutes after takeoff, the Super Heavy rocket booster was scheduled to expend most of its fuel and separate from the Starship spacecraft, leaving the booster to be discarded in the ocean. The Starship was meant to use its own engines, blazing for more than six minutes, to propel itself to nearly orbital speeds. The flight reached its highest point 24.2 miles (39 kilometers) above the ground, and the explosion occurred about four minutes after liftoff, according to SpaceX. “The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble,” according to an update from SpaceX. “The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship.” SpaceX said that “teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test.” The road and beach near the launchpad are expected to remain closed until Friday. “An anomaly occurred during the ascent and prior to stage separation resulting in a loss of the vehicle.  No injuries or public property damage have been reported,” according to a statement Thursday afternoon by the Federal Aviation Administration. “The FAA will oversee the mishap investigation of the Starship / Super Heavy test mission. A return to flight of the Starship / Super Heavy vehicle is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety. This is standard practice for all mishap investigations.” Although it ended in an explosion, Thursday’s test met several of the company’s objectives for the vehicle. Clearing the launchpad was a major milestone for Starship. In the lead-up to liftoff, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sought to temper expectations, saying, “Success is not what should be expected. … That would be insane.” “With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multi-planetary,” SpaceX tweeted after the explosion. Musk congratulated team members on “an exciting test launch” in a post-launch tweet and said they “learned a lot for next test launch in a few months.” In a follow-up email to his employees, Musk added, “I don’t want to jinx it, but I think we are highly likely to reach orbit this year and recover the booster and ship, if not this year, certainly next year. Mars, here we come!” SpaceX will need a new launch license from the FAA to make another attempt, but the company does not expect the process to be as laborious as securing the license for Thursday’s launch. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson took to Twitter to share his congratulations on the flight test. “Every great achievement throughout history has demanded some level of calculated risk, because with great risk comes great reward. Looking forward to all that SpaceX learns, to the next flight test — and beyond.” The test flight comes after years of explosive tests, regulatory hurdles and public hyping from Musk. The company has been known to embrace fiery mishaps during the rocket development process. SpaceX maintains that such accidents are the quickest and most efficient way of gathering data, an approach that sets the company apart from its close partner NASA, which prefers slow, methodical testing over dramatic flare-ups. Musk has talked about Starship — making elaborate presentations about its design and purpose — for years, and he frequently harps on its potential for carrying cargo and humans to Mars, though NASA also plans to use the vehicle to put its astronauts on the moon. He’s even said that his sole purpose for founding SpaceX was to develop a vehicle like Starship that could establish a human settlement on the Red Planet. Throngs of spectators lined local beaches to catch a glimpse of Starship’s takeoff, bringing foldout chairs, children and dogs in tow. It echoed Monday’s turnout for the company’s first launch attempt, which was ultimately grounded as engineers worked to troubleshoot an issue with a valve on the Super Heavy booster. In the area surrounding Starbase — SpaceX’s name for the Starship development site on Texas’ southernmost tip — many locals have greeted the rocket with enthusiasm. There are signs of Starship permeating the area: a model Starship in a front yard, a “Rocket Ranch” camping ground filled with diehard enthusiasts, and a billboard advertising Martian beer. The test flight is a small step in a sweeping project. Before Starship can complete its first mission or host astronauts, SpaceX has significant technological questions to hash out. NASA has tapped SpaceX to provide a Starship lunar lander that would ferry astronauts from a separate spacecraft down to the moon’s surface for the Artemis III mission, which is scheduled as early as 2025. Before that mission can take off, however, SpaceX has to prove that Starship can make it to the moon — much less Mars, which is Musk’s ultimate ambition. The sheer mass of the vehicle will force the company to refuel the spacecraft while it’s still in Earth’s orbit. More than a dozen launches — carrying nothing but propellant — may be required to give a single Starship lunar lander enough fuel to traverse the 238,900-mile (384,500-kilometer) void between Earth and the moon. Before SpaceX can even hash out that process, it’ll also need to put Starship into orbit in the first place. Thursday’s test flight only sought to get to near orbital speeds and make a partial lap of the planet — an achievement that will have to wait for a future test. Even after flight tests begin to prove the vehicle’s design, the Starship spacecraft must be fitted with all the necessary life support equipment astronauts will need for a journey to deep space. NASA was not involved in planning the flight profile for this test flight or directing SpaceX on what to do, according to Lisa Hammond, NASA’s associate program manager of the Human Landing System at Johnson Space Center in Houston. In an interview earlier this month, Hammond did not share a specific checklist of tests or flights that NASA hopes to see before Starship is entrusted with a moon landing mission. “I would not put it with a number,” she said, adding that the Artemis II mission, slated for next year, will see humans fly atop the SLS rocket after only one uncrewed test flight. “The confidence comes in the design, the confidence comes in the safety of the vehicle for the crew,” Hammond said. In addition to the Artemis III mission, Starship already has some ambitious projects on its manifest. SpaceX has sold a Starship-propelled tourism trip around the moon to Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. The mission, dubbed “Dear Moon,” plans to fly Maezawa and eight crewmates, including various artists from around the world. Most of the “Dear Moon” crew was on the ground to witness Starship’s first test flight. Karim Iliya, a photographer currently based in Iceland, described the experience of watching the flight attempt from a few miles away. “This wave of sound just smashed into my body, and I could feel it and I could hear it and I thought: Am I really going inside that machine? It was absolutely wild,” Iliya told CNN. “It was just this feeling of joy and energy running through the crowd and through the people.” Iliya added that the rocket explosion didn’t give him any extra nerves for his future spaceflight. He understood he was watching a prototype take flight. But he experienced a “feeling of intensity” visiting the rocket shortly after Monday’s scrubbed launch attempt. He said the Dear Moon crew was invited to get an up-close look at the rocket then. The vehicle was still venting. “We heard this very loud sound. Many of us — I think — we’re ready to scramble,” Iliya said. “That’s when I realized how alive this machine is and how intense it is and will be when we actually strap ourselves in and leave the planet — which is in itself an absurd thought.” Development of Starship has been based at SpaceX’s privately held spaceport about 40 minutes outside Brownsville, Texas, on the US-Mexico border. Testing began years ago with brief “hop tests” of early spacecraft prototypes. The company started with brief flights that lifted a few dozen feet off the ground before evolving to high-altitude flights, most of which resulted in dramatic explosions as the company attempted to land the prototypes upright. One suborbital flight test in May 2021, however, ended in success. Since then, SpaceX has also been working to get its Super Heavy booster prepared for flight. The gargantuan, 230-foot-tall (69-meter-tall) cylinder is packed with 33 of the company’s Raptor engines. Fully stacked, Starship and Super Heavy stand about 400 feet (120 meters) tall.

      Refined carbs and red meat driving global rise in type 2 diabetes, study says
    ","Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018. “Our study suggests poor carbohydrate quality is a leading driver of diet-attributable type 2 diabetes globally,” says senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University and professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston, in a statement. Another key factor: People are eating far too much red and processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, salami and the like, the study said. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. In fact, the study estimated 7 out of 10 cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide in 2018 were linked to poor food choices. “These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter. Mozaffarian and his team developed a research model of dietary intake between 1990 and 2018 and applied it to 184 countries. Compared with 1990, there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes due to poor diet in 2018, the study found. Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents. Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. Inadequate intake of five protective dietary factors — fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and yogurt — was responsible for just over 39% of the new cases. People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains. “Our modeling approach does not prove causation, and our findings should be considered as estimates of risk,” the authors wrote.

      How to stick with new habits — or kick old ones
    ","Did you set a New Year’s resolution to kick a bad habit, only to find yourself falling back into old patterns? You’re not alone. In fact, research suggests up to 40% of our daily actions are habits — automatic routines we do without thinking. But how do these habits form, and why are they so difficult to break? Habits can be likened to riverbeds. A well-established river has a deep bed, and water is likely to consistently flow in that direction. A new river has a shallow bed, so the flow of water is not well defined — it can vary course and be less predictable. Just like water down a riverbed, habits help our behavior “flow” down a predictable route. But what we are really talking about here is learning and unlearning. READ MORE: How blood flow limits the brain During the early stages of habit formation, the decision parts of your brain (prefrontal cortices) are activated, and the action is very deliberate (instead of hitting snooze, you make the choice to get out of bed). When a new routine is initiated, brain circuits — also called neural networks — are activated. The more often you repeat the new action, the stronger and more efficient these neural networks become. This reorganizing and strengthening of connections between neurons is called neuroplasticity, and in the case of building habits — long-term potentiation. Each time you perform the new action while trying to form a habit, you need smaller cues or triggers to activate the same network of brain cells. Habits strengthen over time as we form associations and earn rewards — for example, not hitting snooze makes getting to work on time easier, so you feel the benefits of your new habit. Later, as habits strengthen, the decision parts of the brain no longer need to kick in to initiate the action. The habit is now activated in memory and considered automatic: The neural circuits can perform the habit without conscious thought. In other words, you don’t need to choose to perform the action any more. READ MORE: 3D-printing the brain’s blood vessels with silicone could improve and personalize neurosurgery Popular media and lifestyle advice from social media influencers often suggest it takes 21 days to make or break a habit — an idea originally presented in the 1960s. This is generally considered an oversimplification, though empirical evidence is surprisingly sparse. A seminal study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology is often cited as showing habits take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form, with an average of about 66 days. In that study, 96 people were asked to choose a new health habit and practice it daily for 84 days. Of the original 96 participants, 39 (about 41%) successfully formed the habit by the end of the study period. The level of success in forming a habit, and the length of time to form the habit, appeared to vary based on the type of goal. For example, goals related to drinking a daily glass of water were more likely to be successful and be performed without conscious thought faster than goals related to eating fruit or exercising. Furthermore, the time of day appeared important, with habits cued earlier in the day becoming automatic more quickly than those cued later in the day (for example, eating a piece of fruit with lunch versus in the evening, and walking after breakfast versus walking after dinner). The study was fairly small, so these findings aren’t definitive. However, they suggest that if you haven’t been able to embed a new habit in 21 days, don’t fret — there’s still hope. READ MORE: Why certain types of music make our brains sing, and others don’t Most of us will also have habits we don’t like — unwanted behaviors. Within the brain, breaking unwanted habits is associated with a different form of neuroplasticity, called long-term depression (not to be confused with the mental health condition). Instead of strengthening neural connections, long-term depression is the process of weakening them. So, how do you silence two neurons that previously have been firing closely together? One popular approach to breaking a bad habit is pinpointing the specific cue or trigger that prompts the behavior and the reward that reinforces the habit. For example, someone might bite their nails when feeling stressed, and the reward is a temporary feeling of distraction, or sensory stimulation. Once the person has identified this connection, they can try to experiment with disrupting it. For example, by using a bitter nail polish, and focusing on deep breathing exercises when feeling stressed. Once disrupted, over time the old behavior of biting the nails can gradually fade. READ MORE: Fatherhood changes men’s brains, according to before-and-after MRI scans To break a habit: To form a habit: If you think of habits like that riverbed, what deepens a river is the volume of water flowing through. With behavior, that means repetition and similarity in repetition: practicing your new habit. Because new habits might be overwhelming, practicing in small chunks can help — so that you are not creating a new riverbed but maybe just deepening parts of the main stream. Finding meaning in the new habit is critical. Some studies have reported strong findings that the belief you can change a habit is also critical. Believing in change and being aware of its potential, along with your commitment to practice, is key.

      How long you can use your vintage Tupperware and other plastic food storage products
    ","Since Tupperware, the iconic kitchen brand that’s been a household name for decades, signaled recently that it might be going out of business, you might be wondering how long your stash of its food storage containers is safe to use — especially if it’s vintage. Figuring out the answer to that question for any type of reusable plastic food storage products — not just Tupperware — often comes down to understanding what they’re made of. Bisphenol A, more commonly known as BPA, is a chemical that, according to the United States Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, has been used for years in the production of certain plastics to make them more durable and shatter-resistant. Unfortunately, it can also make them potential health hazards. In human studies, BPA exposure has been associated with a higher risk of a wide range of health conditions or issues, such as infertility, altered fetal growth of the fetus, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and aggression among children, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis and heart disease, said Laura Vandenberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In addition to food containers, BPA has been used in various other products, such as shatterproof windows, water bottles and eyewear, and in resins coating metal food cans, bottle tops and water supply pipes. The composition of your plastic product can depend on the year you bought it, Vandenberg said. Since March 2010, items Tupperware sells in the US and Canada are BPA-free, according to its website. CNN has contacted Tupperware for comment but has not received a response. “We worry about those hard, shatter-resistant plastics that were made a decade ago, that were made with BPA,” Vandenberg said. “Every single time that they’re used, they’re leaching small amounts of BPA out of them. … Even the low levels of BPA that leach from consumer plastics, canned food linings or other consumer goods … have been shown to be associated with harm, and people certainly should care about it.” “If it’s not safe the day you buy it, it’s not safe 10 years later,” Vandenberg said. In fact, the longer you own them, the riskier they are for your health, she added. Putting stress on plastic food containers by washing them in the dishwasher or with rough scrub brushes “increase the ability of that plastic to leach whatever it was made out of,” Vandenberg said. Scratches can create deep grooves for bacteria to reside in as well, said James Rogers, director of food safety research and testing at Consumer Reports, a nonprofit research, testing and consumer advocacy organization. Putting highly acidic foods — such as tomatoes or citrus fruits — in these products does the same thing, Vandenberg said. The “microwave safe” label on some plastic containers doesn’t mean the product is totally safe from a health standpoint, she added. “Some of the plasticizers and chemicals can transfer from the plastic containers into the food during heating,” Rogers said. “So we totally advocate that you transfer your food from a plastic container into a glass bowl and microwave it that way.” Discoloration of a container can signal that a chemical change has occurred in the plastic, Vandenberg said. “Usually that is happening because there’s lots of little micro-holes or micro-tears,” she explained. “And now there’s an interaction with the food and the plastic (because the plastic is degrading). So if the plastic is discolored, it’s telling you that that plastic is breaking down.” Any damaged plastic food storage containers should be discarded, said Sam Cole, global director of product certification, food equipment and chemicals at the National Safety Foundation, an organization facilitating development of public health standards and certification programs for the protection of food, water, consumer products and the environment. The majority of daily exposure to BPA happens through diet, according to the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “The reason why we worry about BPA is that, going all the way back to the 1930s when it was tested for use as a pharmaceutical, it was clear that it acts like an estrogen,” Vandenberg said. “Estrogen is a pretty powerful hormone that is important for reproduction and fertility, but also really important for the development of sex organs, development of the brain and controlling metabolism. “It has a role in muscle development and fat development,” she added. “So even small amounts of tinkering with the estrogen or estrogen pathways in our body can have really serious outcomes for our health.” The shape of the molecules in BPA make it more likely to bind to estrogen receptors, Vandenberg added. “I avoid using those reusable plastics as much as possible, because I have yet to see good evidence that there are consumer plastics that are free from estrogenic properties.” Generally, plastics with the label “PC” (for polycarbonate) or recycling codes three or seven likely contain BPA, according to Vandenberg and the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Some manufacturers have been phasing BPA and other bisphenols, sometimes called analogues, out of their products due to public attention — rather than regulatory action — but not all, Vandenberg said. “Think about replacing them with something that’s chemically inert, like glass,” Vandenberg said. “If you can’t afford to replace everything all at once, replace them one at a time.” “I know it’s heavy, it can break and all the rest of that, but we think that the advantages to using glass containers for storing food and reheating food outweigh the risks,” Rogers said. You can also opt for porcelain, ceramic or stainless-steel containers, especially for hot foods and liquids, according to Vandenberg and the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

      Why we have nightmares and how to stop them
    ","We leave behind our fears of monsters under the bed as we say goodbye to our childhoods, but one can follow us into adulthood and loom over our heads. Nightmares are more common in childhood, but anywhere from 50% to 85% of adults report having occasional nightmares. Almost everyone can experience nightmares. “Dreams do usually incorporate things that happened during the day, leading some researchers to hypothesize that dreams and rapid eye movement sleep is essential for memory consolidation and cognitive rejuvenation,” said Joshua Tal, a sleep and health psychologist based in Manhattan. “Nightmares are the mind’s attempts at making sense of these events, by replaying them in images during sleep.” Nightmares are what the American Academy of Sleep Medicine call “vivid, realistic and disturbing dreams typically involving threats to survival or security, which often evoke emotions of anxiety, fear or terror.” If someone has frequent nightmares — more than once or twice weekly — that cause distress or impairment at work or among people, he or she might have nightmare disorder. Treatments include medications and behavioral therapies. Addressing frequent nightmares is important since they have also been linked to insomnia, depression and suicidal behavior. Since nightmares can also cause sleep deprivation, they are linked to heart disease and obesity as well. Trying out these 10 steps could help you ease your nightmares and improve your sleep and quality of life. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement sleep, the phase during which our muscles relax and we dream. Waking up during REM sleep enables recollection of the dream and resulting distress, said Jennifer Martin, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s board of directors. “One of the most effective ways to treat nightmare problems in adults is actually to get them sleeping more soundly (so) they wake up less often,” Martin said. A healthy sleep routine begets sound sleep. Develop one by exercising, setting regular sleep and waking times, ensuring your room is dark and cool, avoiding stimulating beverages after midafternoon and engaging in relaxing activities. Alcoholic beverages can induce restlessness and awakenings throughout the night — potentially helping you remember nightmares, Martin said. “A lot of people use alcohol as a way to wind down and feel sleepy at the end of the day, but it’s really not the right solution,” she added. Instead, try herbal teas and other beverages conducive to sleep. If drinking was the only part of your relaxation routine, chat with your partner or read instead. One drink more than three hours before bedtime is OK, Martin said. Just pay attention to whether it causes a post-dinner nap and alertness at bedtime, and eliminate that drink if it does. Snacking can boost metabolism, which causes your brain to be more active and could lead to nightmares, according to the National Sleep Foundation. While some people sleep better after eating a light snack, you should stop eating two to three hours before bedtime. If you notice that you have nightmares afterward, try avoiding nighttime snacking or heavier meals before bed. Some medications can prompt nightmares by interrupting REM sleep. “If people can identify that their nightmares either started or increased when they had a change in their medication, that’s definitely a reason to talk to their doctor” about their medication schedule or alternatives, Martin said. Melatonin, while a popular sleep aid, influences our circadian rhythm that regulates REM sleep, and can lead to more or fewer nightmares. If you want to take melatonin for better sleep, work with a sleep specialist to ensure you’re taking it at the right time and not compounding the problem, Martin said. Progressive muscle relaxation — tensing muscle groups as you inhale and relaxing them as you exhale — has been effective for reducing nightmares. “Nightmares activate the sympathetic nervous system, the ‘fight or flight system,’ the body’s natural response to imminent danger,” said Tal via email. “The body also has an innate relaxation system: the parasympathetic nervous system, aka the ‘rest and digest’ system.” Progressive muscle relaxation and other relaxation activities can help activate that system. Write down your worries to get them all out ahead of time, lest they rear their disquieting heads at night. Journaling can be helpful for alleviating nightmares and stress in general, Tal said. Since our nighttime observations can appear during sleep, “spend some energy engaging with things that are more emotionally neutral or even positive” before bedtime, Martin suggested. During the pandemic, our everyday lives are looking pretty scary, too. “Reading the news media and then hopping into bed is more likely to trigger disturbing and upsetting dreams than looking through pictures from your last vacation with your family,” she added. Imagery rehearsal therapy is effective “when the chronic nightmares are showing similar themes and patterns,” Tal said. Since nightmares can be learned behavior for the brain, this practice involves writing down in detail the narrative elements of the dream. Then rewrite the dream so that it ends positively. Just before falling asleep, set the intention to re-dream by saying aloud, “If or when I have the beginnings of the same bad dream, I will be able to instead have this much better dream with a positive outcome.” “By practicing a rewrite during the daytime, you increase your chances of having them at night while you’re sleeping instead of your nightmare,” Tal said. Silence is key in a sleep routine, but “for people who either don’t like it to be completely quiet or who are awakened by noises they can’t control during the night,” background noise “is a good strategy,” Martin said. Try a fan or a white noise machine or app for several consecutive nights to help your brain adapt, she added. If nothing works and you’re still having nightmares, talk with a therapist or sleep specialist. “Nightmares might be a sign of a larger issue, such as PTSD or a mood disorder,” Tal said. “It is possible to treat the nightmares without treating the underlying disorder, but it may also be helpful to treat both the symptom and the disorder. “There has been great progress on psychological treatments for nightmares, insomnia, anxiety and mood disorders,” Tal added. “Do not be afraid to ask for help; psychotherapy works and it is often short term and accessible.” ",1063,health,2020-09-04,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/health/how-to-stop-nightmares-in-adults-wellness/index.html

      When children are told they were born via assisted reproduction can affect outcomes, study finds
    ","At age 14, Helen wasn’t bothered by the fact she was born via surrogacy. “My mum is still my mum. My dad is still my dad,” she told UK researchers conducting a study on the mental health and well-being of children born through egg donation, sperm donation and surrogacy. Helen is not her real name. “I was talking to someone at school and they said they were an accident,” 14-year-old Simon (also not his real name) told the researchers. “I know I was no accident, I was really wanted, and it makes me feel special.” Parents worried their children may experience difficulties as a result of learning they were conceived by assisted reproduction can stop fretting — the kids are just fine, according to the study published this week after two decades in the making. “When we began this study more than 20 years ago, there was concern the absence of a biological link between the child and the parents could have a damaging effect on their relationship and on the well-being of the child,” said lead author Susan Golombok, professor emerita of family research and former director of the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge in the UK. However, at age 20, children born via egg or sperm donation and surrogacy were psychologically well-adjusted, the study found, especially if parents told the children about their birth history before age 7. “What this research means is that having children in different or new ways doesn’t actually interfere with how families function. Really wanting children seems to trump everything — that’s what really matters,” Golombok said. Clinical psychologist Mary Riddle, an associate professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University called the study “important, in that it represents research conducted over a long period of time.” However, Riddle, who was not involved in the study, said the results aren’t completely applicable to the United States because surrogacy can be practiced differently in the UK in several ways. Called “tummy mummies” by some of the children, surrogates in the UK may become part of the family, participating in the upbringing of the child they helped bring into the world, according to Golombok’s 2020 book, “We Are Family: The Modern Transformation of Parents and Children.” “In the UK, intended parents often know their surrogate prior to the surrogate pregnancy whereas in the US, commercial surrogates are often matched through agencies and don’t have prior relationships with the families for whom they carry babies,” Riddle said. It’s also more common in the UK to use “partial” surrogacy, in which surrogates are impregnated with the sperm of the intended father and are therefore the biological mother of the child, Riddle said. “Here in the US, gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother has no genetic connection to the child she is carrying, is far more common and thought to be potentially less fraught with psychological and legal pitfalls,” she added. The study, published Wednesday in the journal Developmental Psychology, followed 65 children — 22 born by surrogacy, 17 by egg donation and 26 by sperm donation — from infancy until age 20. Another 52 families who did not use any assistance were also followed. Researchers spoke to the families when the children were 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Young adults who learned about their biological origins before age 7 reported better relationships with their mothers, and their mothers had lower levels of anxiety and depression, the study found. However, children born through surrogacy had some relationship issues around age 7, “which seemed to be related to their increased understanding of surrogacy at that age,” Golombok said. “We visited the families when the children were 10, and these difficulties had disappeared,” she said. “Interestingly, the same phenomenon has been found among internationally adopted children. It may have to do with having to confront issues of identity at a younger age than other children.” Developmentally, children begin to notice and ask questions about pregnancy between the ages of 3 and 4, said clinical psychologist Rebecca Berry, an adjunct faculty member in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “To satisfy their curiosity they’ll begin to ask questions about babies and where they came from as a way of trying to understand why they are here,” said Berry, who was not involved with the study. Children as young as 7 will already have a basic understanding of genetics, and can be surprised when they learn they aren’t genetically connected to one or both parents, said Lauri Pasch, a psychology professor at the University of California San Francisco, who specializes in infertility and family building. “Our current thinking is that it is best for parents to share the story of donor conception with their children at a very early age, so that if I were to ask their child when they are an adult when they learned that they were donor conceived, they would respond that they ‘always knew,’” said Pasch, who was also not involved in the study, via email. “This allows the child to grow up with the information, as opposed to learning it later in life, when it comes as a surprise or shock and can hurt their trust in their parents and their identity development,” she added. When it came to maternal anxiety and depression, there were no differences between families formed by surrogacy and egg or sperm donation and families with children born without assisted conception. Nor were they any differences in the mothers’ relationships with their partners at home, the study found. However, mothers who had babies via donor eggs reported less positive family relationships than mothers who used sperm donation, likely due to insecurities about lack of a genetic connection to their children, Golombok said. Young adults conceived by sperm donation reported poorer family communication than those conceived by egg donation, the study found. That’s perhaps due to a greater reluctance on the part of fathers to disclose they are not a genetic parent, Golombok said. Only 42% of parents who had conceived via sperm donor had revealed the child’s birth history by the time their children were age 20, compared to 88% of egg donation parents and 100% of  parents who used surrogacy. When asked, many of the children said they weren’t concerned about how they were conceived. “A lot of the children said ‘It’s not a big deal. I’ve got more interesting things going on in my life,’ while others said ‘Actually it’s something a bit special about me. I like talking about it,’ Golombok said. “I think it’s really nice to hear from the children themselves and I don’t think any other study has done this.” Once told, a child needs to revisit the birth history from time to time, so parents should be sure any conversation is an ongoing one, Golombok said. “There is this idea parents will tell the child and that is it. But you need to keep having these conversations to give the child a chance to ask questions in an age appropriate way as they grow older,” she said. “Many of the parents in our study use children’s books that were specifically designed for this purpose,” Golombok added. “Then they could bring the child’s own story into the narrative.” ",1216,health,2023-04-12,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/health/children-of-surrogates-wellness/index.html

      This California city’s newest police recruit, ‘Officer Hops,’ is a therapy bunny
    ","Police dogs are nothing new — but a bunny in uniform is something that sound more like a character in an animated children’s movie than real-life recruit. Not anymore. “We would like to introduce Wellness Officer Percy,” wrote police department in Yuba City, California in a recent Facebook post, sharing a picture of a brown and white bunny rabbit in a tiny K9 police harness. “Officer Percy lounges at the police department during the day and is a support animal for all.” Also known as “Officer Hops,” Percy is a part of the department’s recent focus on promoting mental health support for their staff. He serves as an outlet for stress when he is in the office, and as a friendly face when he is out visiting in the community. “Our wellness program promotes the importance of prioritizing mental and physical health, providing tools and resources to reduce stress and create a positive foundation for well-being,” said the department in their Facebook post. Percy was found by Ashley Carson, a member of the police department, in the middle of a road last October. Carson took the rabbit to animal control once realizing he was domesticated, but he was never claimed, according to the department. Newly-named after the road he was found on — Percy Avenue — the bunny was adopted by another staff member soon after. Emotional support animals have become increasingly popular in recent years, with several studies reporting evidence of their health benefits, including the decrease of anxiety and depression in their owners. A 2020 study found that petting an animal can boost cognitive and emotional brain activity, for example, while a 2022 study found that just 10 minutes with a therapy dog reduced pain in emergency room patients. “Recognition of our mutually beneficial relationship with domesticated animals, and in particular companion animals, is ever evolving,” said Colleen Dell, a sociology professor at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, via email. Dell has for years researched the relationships between humans and animals. “When our team first started researching the impact of therapy dogs visiting with university students ten years ago, there was somewhat limited recognition of their potentially important role in human’s lives,” Dell said. “Today, therapy dogs are on many campuses across North America, and in spaces you would never have thought you would see (them), like a hospital emergency department.” It’s important to keep in mind a support animal’s feelings too, Dell noted, as any human-animal relationship can be complicated. Picking up on body language is important to monitor their wellness — in the case of Percy, purring can signal a happy bunny, whereas pushed-back ears likely mean the opposite. Percy’s new position could also help bring attention to the wider welfare of his species, which is often neglected, according to Dell. “Bunnies are adored in North America for being cute, friendly and cuddly,” Dell said. “In face of what officers and others in the station may face in their jobs, this can serve as a nice counterbalance.” “This is an excellent way to establish rapport with the community,” she added. “There is a strong message here to build upon, of respecting others, including animals.” ",530,health,2023-04-11,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/11/health/officer-hops-police-department-bunny-wellness/index.html

      After fall of Roe, future doctors show less interest in training in states with abortion bans or as ob/gyns
    ","The Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal right to an abortion created a patchwork of laws across the United States and widespread uncertainty. Among those with questions are the nation’s future doctors. Morgan Levy, a medical school student at the University of Miami, said the impacts of the ruling immediately became a point of discussion among her peers. She’ll be applying to residency training programs this fall, and now has to assess whether the new laws will affect what she’s taught and how. “More than ever, I recognize the importance of good, comprehensive, evidence-based reproductive health care,” said Levy, who plans to train as an ob/gyn. In some states, though, it has become “all but impossible” to get formal family planning training, including abortion practices. “There is definitely a consideration of making sure that the training programs that I’m applying to are going to be able to provide the kind of training that I’m going to need in order to be able to do that for my patients,” she said. And new data suggests that these restrictions are having an impact on where – and what – future doctors plan to practice. The number of medical school students who applied to residency training programs ticked down last year, and applications to programs in states with abortion bans dropped the most, according to a new analysis from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Interest in the ob/gyn speciality took a notable dip, with applications dropping 5% nationwide and twice as much in states where abortion is banned. Emergency medicine also saw a significantly large drop in applications. Despite the decline in applications, all ob/gyn residency positions and most others were filled. So while there’s no immediate shortage of physicians in-training, experts say the shift is reason for concern. “I worry about exacerbating these maternal health care and abortion deserts that already exist. We already have a gap,” said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn in New Jersey and chair of the board of directors for Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Because of that, we need more ob/gyns to join the field to help build up practice in places where we’re losing providers for other reasons.” More than a third of US counties have limited or no access to maternity care, according to a recent report – and there’s notable overlap between maternity care deserts and states where abortion access is limited. Most physicians stay in the area that they trained. If programs in states with abortion bans shift to less desirable training plans, more and more students could prioritize being in less restrictive states for residency – and eventually to practice. Long-term, that could create a “tiered system of health care,” Brandi said. However, experts say it will be important to track the preferences for medical school students in the years to come. Last year’s graduating class applied to residency programs just months after the Supreme Court’s ruling. They had to make decisions before seeing exactly how the programs would react and adjust. “For the next year or two, things are gonna be really uncertain for people. And I think that many people didn’t want to engage in that uncertainty, not knowing what they were signing up for,” Brandi said. For Levy and others, perhaps more important than the specific location of a program is evidence that there is a strong and well-established commitment to training around family planning. “That’s really a green flag to me when programs have a really formal plan in place,” Levy said. The Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell has long participated in the Ryan Residency Training Program that offers a specific focus on abortion and family planning. Dr. Nagaraj Gabbur, who is the director of the ob/gyn residency program there, said that this specialized curriculum is usually one of the top reasons applicants give for why they want to practice there – and especially in the latest round of interviews. For programs outside of “haven states” like New York, this could involve an out-of-state rotation. But for Brandi, rotational programs are just a “Band-Aid” that don’t address the underlying issues challenging reproductive health care – and don’t consider the livelihood of the individual trainee. Also, most of the physicians in the ob/gyn field are women. Even if certain training programs suffice, there might be personal concerns about living in states where abortion is banned, she says. “This may impact not only the care that they want to provide as physicians, but also the care they can receive themselves,” Brandi said. As Levy and her peers consider a major step forward for their lives and career, discussions on the topic are constant – and complicated. “It’s not a black or white or red versus blue kind of issue,” Levy said. There are a lot of mixed emotions as people weigh many different factors, including clinical interests, logistics of the role, personal preference for location and broader implications. Some feel strongly that they should train in a state that has preserved access to abortion, while others, like Levy, feel that there may be opportunity for advocacy in more restrictive environments. “It’s almost less so about the state itself and more so about the program’s attitudes and responses to the decision and the ways in which they’ve affirmed their commitment to making sure great care is provided in their states,” Levy said.

      Silence along Ukraine’s southern front fuels speculation over counteroffensive
    ","Miles of empty fields where you might expect a build-up of armor. Tank tracks that emerge in the mud from nowhere, and lead there too. Distant artillery duels that locals say peak and ebb. The silence is beginning to be telling. Ukraine has made extraordinary efforts to conceal the start of its strategically vital counteroffensive. Like with its fast and smart push around Izyum and Kharkiv in the late summer last year, we may only learn of success once it has been conclusively achieved. Ukraine’s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar stated last week that the counteroffensive would not be announced. Russia, for its part, is also reluctant to speak of Ukrainian momentum, perhaps in case that shatters flaky morale among its own troops; little, too, has emerged from its side. Just Sunday, the US-based Institute for the Study of War reported comments by Russian military bloggers suggesting that Ukrainian forces had crossed the Dnipro River near Kherson – in small numbers, but in places where Moscow would prefer to think they were not. It was unclear how sustained or unprecedented the apparent small Ukrainian landings were, or how they fitted in to Ukraine’s wider plan. Ukraine’s Southern Command said little but opaquely called for “patience.” Its spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said: “The conditions of the military operation require information silence until it is safe enough for our military.” Over the past 10 days, Ukraine has been noticeably silent about the whole Zaporizhzhia area where its counteroffensive is largely expected. Only there can its military separate the occupied peninsula of Crimea from occupied territory in eastern Ukraine and the Russian mainland. There have been tiny comments from Russia’s legion of military bloggers who have been, given the tight operational security deployed by Kyiv, often the first source of information about Ukrainian maneuvers in the past offensives. Kopani, Marfopil, Kamianske, Polohy – these are all places where pro-Russian bloggers have suggested Ukrainian attempts to move forward. The evidence for these claims is frustratingly unclear, and bloggers have a poor track record. Russian aviation is also trying to hit what it thinks are Ukrainian targets. The town of Orikhiv, about 40 miles southeast of Zaporizhzhia, has seen the repeated bombardment of anything that might resemble a military hub: a sports school, a farming warehouse - empty buildings now featuring a vast crater. The tiny settlement of Vuhledar, on the further eastern end of where Ukraine might launch a counteroffensive in the south, has been hit by several heavy airstrikes in the past 48 hours. The intense and indiscriminate Russian firepower suggests the high stakes of the weeks ahead. This is a fight that Moscow has known is coming for six months. The Russians have had ample time to prepare. Russian President Vladimir Putin himself even visited the theater of war last week and met with the head of the airborne forces, Mikhail Teplinsky, whose paratroopers will be at the forefront of any defense. They have dug networks of winding trenches and defenses, which Ukrainian troops will likely either stumble on, or just go around. It is a decisive moment in the war for the Kremlin. Russia’s leaders have publicly invested what little resources they have left in a so-far unsuccessful push for the strategically unimportant city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The enormous losses on both sides, over a savage winter in which the city has been mauled beyond recognition, have not reflected the small advantage Russia would have if it eventually gained control of the entire city. It has yet to do so, and – as now is often the case – would be the victors over uninhabitable rubble. Gains for Ukrainian forces in Zaporizhzhia, however, could strike a more potent blow to Russia’s wider campaign. It is the land corridor from occupied Donbas to occupied Crimea – the piece of territory seized by Russia last year that is in the long term the most useful, linking by land a peninsula annexed in 2014 with the Russian mainland. Losing this would greatly imperil Russia’s military in Crimea and split its occupation in two. It would also betray the strategic incompetence of its military, if they were unable to prevent this most glaringly obvious of Ukrainian ambitions. This is also as decisive a moment for Kyiv. NATO has been uncharacteristically united and bold in its support and arming of Ukraine. This sort of clarity of purpose is an outlier in Western democracies, and one that elections, economic variables, and other distractions may dilute in the year ahead. Ukraine cannot count on this level of support this time next year, whatever the press releases today say. The Ukrainians face an enemy weaker than it has been for months, with the Russians even sending wounded convicts back to fight on the frontline, according to accounts from convict recruits. Kyiv’s forces have better weaponry and training from NATO than ever before. And they surely have good, real-time information from their Western allies to pry open any advantage. And the silence that we see now – the near total absence of TikToks or commentary from the Zaporizhzhia front line – may be the clearest indicator yet that this vital step is afoot.

      Chinese ambassador sparks European outrage over suggestion former Soviet states don’t exist
    ","European countries are demanding answers from Beijing after its top diplomat in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet republics, in comments that could undermine China’s efforts to be seen as a potential mediator between Russia and Ukraine. The remarks by China’s ambassador to France Lu Shaye, who said during a television interview that former Soviet countries don’t have “effective status in international law,” have caused diplomatic consternation, especially in the Baltic states. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia would be summoning Chinese representatives to ask for clarification, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis confirmed on Monday. Officials including from Ukraine, Moldova, France and the European Union also all hit back with criticisms of Lu’s comments. Lu made the remarks in response to a question on whether Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, was part of Ukraine. “Even these ex-Soviet countries don’t have an effective status in international law because there was no international agreement to materialize their status as sovereign countries,” Lu said, after first noting that the question of Crimea “depends on how the problem is perceived” as the region was “at the beginning Russian” and then “offered to Ukraine during the Soviet era.” The remarks appeared to disavow the sovereignty of countries that became independent states and United Nations members after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 – and come amid Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine under leader Vladimir Putin’s vision the country should be part of Russia. The Chinese embassy in France said later that Lu’s comments were “not a statement of policy, but an expression of personal views.” “On territorial sovereignty, the Chinese side’s position is consistent and clear. The Chinese side respects the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries and upholds the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,” the embassy said in a statement on Monday. “Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the countries concerned… The Chinese side respects the status of the republics born after the dissolution of the Soviet Union as sovereign countries,” it added. The statement followed similar comments from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a press briefing earlier Monday. Beijing has so far refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or call for a withdrawal of its troops, instead urging restraint by “all parties” and accusing NATO of fueling the conflict. It has also continued to deepen diplomatic and economic ties with Moscow. The statement from the Chinese embassy in France continued: “On the issue of Ukraine, China’s position is consistent and clear. It is ready to continue working with the international community to make its own contribution to the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.” Meanwhile, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said that China will be discussed during a foreign ministers meeting on Monday. “We have been talking a lot about China (over) the last days, but we will have to continue discussing about China because it’s one of the most important issues for our foreign policy,” Borrell said. The EU foreign ministers will also raise the situation in Moldova and Georgia, as those countries “see the war (in Ukraine) very close, they feel the threat,” he added. Moldova is a small country on Ukraine’s southwestern border that has been caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion. Georgia, which shares a frontier with Russia further east, has also come under the spotlight, after protests erupted over a controversial foreign agents bill similar to one adopted in the Kremlin to crack down on political dissent. “For us Georgia is a very important country and remember that it has specific security issues because its territory is partially occupied by Russia,” Borrell said. On Sunday, he tweeted that the remarks by the Chinese ambassador were “unacceptable” and “the EU can only suppose these declarations do not represent China’s official policy.” France also responded Sunday, with its Foreign Ministry stating its “full solidarity” with all the allied countries affected and calling on China to clarify whether these comments reflect its position, according to Reuters. Germany on Monday also called for China to clarify, especially since the statements “were not in line with the Chinese position known to us so far.” “Of course we expect China to explain its position unequivocally,” German Foreign Office spokesman Christian Wagner said. “The sovereignty and territorial integrity of these states is inviolable,” he added. Several leaders in former Soviet states, including Ukraine, were quick to hit back following the interview, which aired Friday on French station LCI. Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics called for an “explanation from the Chinese side and complete retraction of this statement” in a post on Twitter Saturday. He pledged to raise the issue during a meeting of EU foreign ministers Monday. “We are surprised about Chinese (ambassador’s) statements questioning sovereignty of countries declaring independence in ’91. Mutual respect & (territorial) integrity have been key to Moldova-China ties,” the Moldovan ministry said on its official Twitter account. “Our expectations are that these declarations do not represent China’s official policy.” “It is strange to hear an absurd version of the ‘history of Crimea’ from a representative of a country that is scrupulous about its thousand-year history,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s Presidential Administration, also wrote on Twitter. “If you want to be a major political player, do not parrot the propaganda of Russian outsiders,” he added. This is not the first time that Lu – a prominent voice among China’s so-called aggressive “wolf-warrior” diplomats – has sparked controversy for his views. “He’s been a well-known provocateur,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. “But he’s a diplomat, he represents his government, so it reflects some thinking within China about the issue,” he said. adding, however, that it’s “not the time for China to put at risk its relationship” with France. The comments place Beijing under the spotlight at a particularly sensitive moment for its European diplomacy. Ties have soured as Europe has uneasily watched China’s tightening relationship with Russia and its refusal to condemn Putin’s invasion. Beijing in recent months has sought to mend its image, highlighting its stated neutrality in the conflict and desire to play a “constructive role” in dialogue and negotiation, further fueling debate in European capitals over how to calibrate its relationship with China, a key economic partner. That debate intensified this month following a visit to Beijing from French President Emmanuel Macron, who signed a raft of cooperation agreements with China during a trip he framed as an opportunity to start work with Beijing to push for peace in Ukraine. Voices in former Soviet states, where many remember being under Communist authoritarian rule, have been among those in Europe critical of such an approach. “If anyone is still wondering why the Baltic States don’t trust China to ‘broker peace in Ukraine,’ here’s a Chinese ambassador arguing that Crimea is Russian and our countries’ borders have no legal basis,” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Landsbergis wrote on Twitter Saturday following Lu’s interview. Moritz Rudolf, a fellow and research scholar at the Paul Tsai China Center of the Yale Law School in the US, said China had been “increasingly successful in being perceived as a responsible power that might play a constructive role in a peace process in Ukraine.” Lu’s comments “directly undermined China’s latest diplomatic outreach efforts to Europe and Beijing’s ambition to be viewed” in this light, Rudolf said. They also contradicted China’s “official position and practice,” including as Beijing had not recognized Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea or any territory it annexed since 2014, he added. “Beijing is now exercising damage control underlining that the stakes are high for the (People’s Republic of China),” he said, pointing to the statements from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassy in France. Others suggested Lu’s remarks may also shed light on Beijing’s real diplomatic priorities. For Russia, giving up control of Crimea is widely seen as a non-starter in any potential peace settlement on Ukraine. This means Beijing may have a hard time giving a straight answer on this question, according to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center. “The question is impossible to answer for China. China’s relationship with Russia is where its influence comes from,” she said, adding that didn’t mean Lu could have given a “better answer.” “Between sabotaging China’s relationship with Russia and angering Europe, (Lu) chose the latter.” ",1413,china,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/china/china-ambassador-lu-shaye-baltic-soviet-states-europe-intl-hnk/index.html

      Russia’s deputy defense minister is under sanctions. His ex-partner is still living the high life in Europe, investigation reveals
    ","On a rainy Sunday afternoon, a handful of protesters gather outside an upscale Parisian apartment complex. “Freedom for political prisoners!” they chant. “Down with Putin! Putin is a war criminal!” Several hold signs: “He makes money off the war in Ukraine. His family lives in France,” or “Family of a war criminal lives in Paris.” What’s brought them here is the Russian socialite who reportedly rents one of the apartments inside, and her other half, Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov. Svetlana Maniovich is a woman of expensive tastes: invite-only Parisian jewelers, couture clothing and yacht vacations on the Mediterranean. The lifestyle isn’t unusual for people in her elite Russian circle, and her lavish spending has been on display on social media and in Russia’s society pages. But she’s no ordinary Moscow highflyer. Her former partner, Ivanov, is a senior architect of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – a man who, on paper, reportedly has an official income of around $175,000 per year. He’s also the subject of European Union (EU) and American sanctions over the war on Ukraine. Maniovich is the subject of an extensive investigation by the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), an investigative team founded by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The ACF, which organized the Paris protest, alleges that it is Ivanov, and ill-gotten gains brought in by his government position, that has funded Maniovich’s lifestyle. “For the uber-corrupt people, it’s almost like it was – almost like nothing changed,” said Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations for the ACF, in reference to the impact of Western sanctions. Drawing on a trove of 8,000 leaked emails, Pevchikh and her team assembled a picture of a woman who has seemingly escaped all scrutiny for Ivanov’s role in Ukraine, and the extreme profits he’s allegedly reaped. A video about Maniovich produced by the ACF has racked up over six million views on YouTube. Using invoices found in her email, the ACF investigation claims, for instance, that on March 25, 2022 – as Russian missiles were raining down on Kharkiv – Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewelry store on the famed Place Vendome. Just last month, and more than five months after the EU placed Ivanov on its sanctions list, a Ukrainian video crew caught Maniovich on camera shopping and dancing in Courchevel, the elite French ski resort. Maniovich – who also goes by Svetlana Ivanova, as well as by her maiden name, Svetlana Zakharova – did not return CNN’s request for comment. CNN has not independently verified the source of Maniovich’s apparently unexplained wealth. Her lifestyle is funded, the ACF alleges, by the graft of Ivanov, who holds “one of the most lucrative jobs that one can have in the Ministry of Defense,” according to Pevchikh. “He is responsible for construction,” Pevchikh said. “So every building site (that) there is for the Russian army, that’s his domain.” His extreme wealth – with assets including, the ACF says, a historical house in one of Moscow’s most expensive districts, and a luxurious dacha – has a simple explanation. “The answer is corruption,” Pevchikh argued. “Corruption, and specifically kickbacks. This is the system, the core concept of Russian corruption.” The Russian Ministry of Defense did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. The ACF alleges that Ivanov, already a wealthy man, is benefitting extensively from the invasion of Ukraine. The minister is frequently pictured in Russian-occupied Mariupol by state media, cutting ribbons on various construction projects. When Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Mariupol in March, he held what was billed as an impromptu middle-of-the-night encounter with residents at one of Ivanov’s new apartment blocks. “They destroyed Mariupol first, and then they designated a little plot of land where they built display houses,” Pevchikh said. “The same company that built the display houses in Mariupol is paying for Timur Ivanov’s personal bills, personal construction projects, like his house on the outskirts of Moscow and his house in the center of Moscow,” she claimed. So how is Maniovich able to get away with her luxurious, European lifestyle? “It’s a very simple trick that they’ve played,” Pevchikh said. First, she said, Maniovich has an Israeli passport, through her first husband. But more to the point, the ACF alleges, Maniovich and Ivanov have severed their ties – at least on paper. The pair finalized their divorce in August 2022,  according to court documents included by ACF in their investigation – six months after the war began and just two months before the EU placed an asset freeze and travel ban on him – but not her. Yet no public records show Maniovich and Ivanov have even begun the process to divide assets or custody (which can take years), the ACF says. “The biggest indication of a real divorce is the division of assets afterwards. We see none of that,” Pevchikh said, referring to the evidence uncovered by ACF’s investigative team. “In terms of the things that legally point to a real divorce, we don’t see any changes. It all still looks the same.” In a statement to CNN, the French Foreign Ministry said it does not comment on individual cases, but that it had targeted 1,499 Russian officials with sanctions. “We are continuing discussions with other member states in order to adopt new sanctions, to maintain pressure on Russia and to hinder its war effort,” the ministry said. Whether the protesters’ demand that Maniovich herself face a reckoning is, so far, a question without a satisfactory answer.

      Foreign powers rescue nationals while Sudanese must fend for themselves
    ","Foreign powers have rescued embassy staff, diplomats and nationals caught in Sudan’s deadly fighting, even as on the ground many Sudanese are stuck in deteriorating and deadly conditions. At least 50 people were injured and an unknown number killed in shelling that rocked the capital Khartoum on Monday, the Preliminary Committee of Sudan Doctors’ Union said in a statement. Meanwhile foreign governments led rescue efforts to evacuate civilians from the intense conflict. US special forces helped bring almost 100 people – mostly US embassy staff, as well as a small number of diplomatic professionals from other countries – to safety over the weekend, US officials said. Many other nations are scrambling to do the same, with more than 1,000 European Union nationals evacuated so far. The United Nations has temporarily relocated its Khartoum-based staff to Port of Sudan, it said in a statement. Around 700 UN, international NGO and embassy staff and their dependents traveled by road to the Red Sea city, the statement said. The evacuations have been complicated by ongoing clashes. The two sides at the center of more than a week of fighting – Sudan’s army and a paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – blamed each other after a French evacuation convoy came under fire trying to leave Sudan, with one French national injured. An Egyptian diplomat, Mohamed Al-Gharawi, was shot and killed on his way back to the Egyptian embassy in Khartoum on Monday following “evacuation procedures for Egyptian citizens in Sudan,” Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. The Sudanese Armed Forces accused RSF for the death, which CNN has been unable to independently verify. The RSF responded by offering their sincerest condolences to the Egyptian government and said that they will “spare no effort in cooperating with the brothers in the Republic of Egypt to uncover the facts about the Gharawi incident.” Meanwhile, many Sudanese civilians are either trapped in their homes with dwindling food, or desperately looking to find exit routes out of the country via its land borders, with the capital’s main international airport still shuttered. Sudan’s military leader, Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, and commander of the RSF, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, seized control of the country in a military coup in 2021 and were due to hand over power to a civilian government but turned on each other instead. More than 420 people have been killed and 3,700 injured in the fighting, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The humanitarian situation on the ground is deteriorating without access to medical services, and with many left stranded without food or water. A series of ceasefires, including the latest called for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, have been broken. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the warring factions had agreed on a new 72-hour ceasefire to begin at midnight, “following intense negotiation over the past 48 hours.” Residents in parts of Khartoum told CNN early on Sunday morning that there were no signs that the cessation of hostilities was being adhered to, as they awoke to aerial attacks, heavy artillery, explosions and gunfire. They relayed that clashes were raging around the military headquarters and presidential palace in the city center. Despite the risks, foreign governments continue to announce rescue missions for their citizens. French Foreign Minister spokesman Anne-Claire Legendre told CNN’s  Isa Soares on Monday that France evacuated approximately 500 people including almost 200 of them from 36 other countries. Legendre said, “We’ve evacuated approximately 500 people. Now they’re safe and in security in Djibouti in our air force base there,” and added “We offered support to our friendly partners and allies. And there’s more than 36 nationalities, different nationalities that have been rescued, so almost 200 people from 36 other countries that we managed to evacuate.” France evacuated “12 American citizens as well as British, Irish but also from Africa, Asia and rest of the world,” Legendre pointed out. Several other countries have successfully carried out evacuations, including Spain, Jordan, Italy, Denmark and Germany, while the United Kingdom has evacuated embassy staff. Several of those convoys also carried citizens from other countries, including Swedes, Portuguese, Mexicans, Palestinians, Iraqis and Syrians. US citizens in Sudan were advised they could join evacuation convoys organized by the UAE and Turkey on Sunday, with the US government saying it has no plans for its own citizen evacuation. There are an estimated 16,000 American citizens in Sudan – most of whom are dual nationals. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said Monday that more than 1,000 EU nationals have been evacuated so far, calling it a “successful operation.” More evacuations are still being planned or are underway for the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Egypt, Turkey, Libya, India, Russia, Australia, Japan, China and the Philippines. About 500 Indian nationals reached Port Sudan with more on the way, India’s Minister of External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar said Monday. The German Armed Forces evacuated 311 people on Monday morning, including Germans and evacuees from more than 20 other nations. A Spanish military plane with 34 Spaniards and 38 citizens from 11 other nations landed in Madrid on Monday morning, according to Spain’s foreign ministry. Uganda is evacuating 300 of its citizens via buses to the Ethiopian border, where they will fly out of Ethiopian city of Gondar, Dickson Ogwang, the head of the chancery of the Ugandan embassy in Khartoum, told CNN. Up to 50 Irish citizens have been extracted from Sudan in the last 24 hours with the assistance of France and Spain, the country’s foreign minister said Monday. In Rome, the first Italian nationals evacuated from Sudan landed in the capital on Monday evening local time. Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that some Japanese nations evacuated from Sudan had arrived in Djibouti, with the help of the French government. At the same time, Britons in Sudan said they feel “abandoned” by the UK government’s move to evacuate diplomats only. One British citizen, named Fatima, told the BBC that she feels “abandoned” by the government, calling the situation on the ground “traumatizing.” Meanwhile, the UK’s Africa Minister Andrew Mitchell has stressed that the government “will do everything” it can to get thousands of British citizens out of Sudan. But as foreign nationals rush out on evacuation planes, millions of Sudanese citizens have been left to fend for themselves – stranded for days in their homes and uncertain of how to make their way out to safety. International organizations have condemned the fighting, which has targeted hospitals. Out of 79 hospitals in the Sudanese capital, only 22 are currently operational, according to the Central Committee for Sudan Doctors. One doctor told CNN that food and medical supplies are running precariously low. Howeida Al-Hassan, who is a doctor at Khartoum’s Alban Jadid Hospital, told CNN that  most victims coming into the hospital have suffered multiple gunshot wounds. “Every injured person we get has multiple gunshot wounds – bullets in the chest, stomach, leg. Each surgery takes a long time,” Al-Hassan told CNN on Monday. She also says the medical team at the hospital have been working around the clock for the past 10 days. “It’s the same staff from the first day [of the fighting].  We went in and never left. We are very exhausted. We sleep sitting down,” Al-Hassan said. “You can’t really call it sleeping, it’s more like passing out.” As regions of Sudan are battered by the violence, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it will have to “adapt” its emergency response. “We have managed to relocate some our staff by road to Kassala and Gedaref and will try to evacuate some non-essential personnel by road to Ethiopia and Chad,” Africa’s regional spokesperson Alyona Synenko told CNN in a statement. “We are also urgently looking for ways to deploy additional personnel and deliver supplies to provide emergency response in Khartoum and other regions of Sudan affected by fighting.” Isma’il Kushkush, a Sudanese-American journalist based in Khartoum, was trapped with 29 residents, including children and foreign nationals, in a building in downtown Khartoum near the presidential palace for days. “No power or water for five days. Using little water remaining in water tank. Running out of food rations. Unable to leave the building which is located two blocks from the presidential palace. Epicenter of the fighting since the conflict began,” he said in a string of text messages to CNN. The group was later safely evacuated. In neighborhood WhatsApp group chats and on social media, others were deliberating over where to get water, to charge phones, find medics and find safe passages out of Khartoum free of fighting. Many asked for advice on routes to Egypt on public transportation. A woman in her 30s, who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CNN that she managed to flee Khartoum by bus to Egypt. She said she was driven to do so by the unpredictability of the RSF and the worsening conditions in the capital. While her family had a generator and they were able to supply water to houses in their neighborhood, it was unclear how long they would be able to carry on or when the tide of clashes might bring fighters to their doorstep. “It was a case of do we stay and risk starvation. Or be killed by a stray bullet? … We decided to take the risk,” she said, adding that she had heard of people without food and water dying in their homes. “We just figured we were sitting ducks  sheltering in our houses.” A group of her relatives, including two babies and an elderly woman with a serious medical condition, found a bus driver willing to take them to Egypt. They left Friday morning and arrived at the border on Saturday evening; the group was only stopped once by Sudan’s armed forces in Omdurman, she said. But they struggled to get men without visas into Egypt and a few people without passports – including newborn babies – were turned away. “They had to be left behind. And we’re still trying to work out how to get them paperwork to get them across the border,” she said.

      NASA mission detects first seismic waves traveling through the center of Mars
    ","When quakes rumbled on Mars and a meteorite smacked into the red planet during the past four years, NASA’s InSight lander collected soundwaves that helped reveal secrets of the Martian interior. During these events, InSight detected for the first time seismic waves traveling through the Martian core. Now, scientists have used the lander’s data to determine that Mars has a liquid iron-alloy core that also includes lightweight elements such as sulfur and oxygen, as well as smaller amounts of hydrogen and carbon. Developing a greater understanding of the Martian interior can help scientists learn more about how rocky planets such as Earth and Mars form, how the two planets differ, and the factors that help make other planets habitable for life. A study detailing the findings was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “In 1906, scientists first discovered the Earth’s core by observing how seismic waves from earthquakes were affected by traveling through it,” said study coauthor Vedran Lekic, associate professor of geology at the University of Maryland, College Park, in a statement. “More than a hundred years later, we’re applying our knowledge of seismic waves to Mars. With InSight, we’re finally discovering what’s at the center of Mars and what makes Mars so similar yet distinct from Earth.” Researchers analyzed how long it took seismic waves generated by one marsquake as well as a meteorite impact to travel through the Martian core, allowing them to estimate the core’s density and chemical composition. Earth has a liquid outer core and a solid inner core, but the Martian core appears to be made entirely from liquid. Mars’ core is also slightly denser and smaller than scientists believed, with a radius of approximately 1,106 to 1125 miles (1,780 to 1,810 kilometers). “You can think of it this way; the properties of a planet’s core can serve as a summary about how the planet formed and how it evolved dynamically over time,” said study coauthor Nicholas Schmerr, associate professor of geology at the University of Maryland, College Park in a statement. “The end result of the formation and evolution processes can be either the generation or absence of life-sustaining conditions. The uniqueness of Earth’s core allows it to generate a magnetic field that protects us from solar winds, allowing us to keep water. Mars’ core does not generate this protective shield, and so the planet’s surface conditions are hostile to life.” Mars currently lacks a magnetic field, but there are traces of magnetism that linger in the Martian crust. The traces lead scientists to believe that Mars likely once supported a potentially habitable environment, but evolved over time to become an inhospitable frozen desert. “It’s like a puzzle in some ways,” Lekic said. “For example, there are small traces of hydrogen in Mars’ core. That means that there had to be certain conditions that allowed the hydrogen to be there, and we have to understand those conditions in order to understand how Mars evolved into the planet it is today.” Initially, the InSight mission, the first to study the interior of Mars, was only supposed to last for about two years. But NASA extended the mission for another two years. “The extra mission time certainly paid off,” said lead study author Dr. Jessica Irving, senior lecturer in Earth sciences at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, in a statement. “We’ve made the very first observations of seismic waves travelling through the core of Mars. Two seismic signals, one from a very distant marsquake and one from a meteorite impact on the far side of the planet, have allowed us to probe the Martian core with seismic waves. We’ve effectively been listening for energy travelling through the heart of another planet, and now we’ve heard it.” The InSight mission continued to collect data about Mars until the very end, falling silent in December 2022 after dust blocked its solar panels from receiving necessary sunlight. But the treasure trove of data the lander collected during four years on the Martian surface has changed the way scientists understand the red planet. “InSight will continue to influence how we understand the formation and evolution of Mars and other planets for years to come,” Lekic said.

      Why the northern and southern lights appear to be so active right now
    ","The breathtaking dancing shimmer of the aurora borealis and its counterpart in the southern hemisphere, aurora australis, dazzles those lucky enough to catch a glimpse of Earth’s greatest light show. The northern and southern lights, which are usually confined to the Arctic and Antarctica, have generated awe and wonder for centuries. In recent months, photographers and night sky watchers have been capturing the colorful display further south (or north if you’re in the southern hemisphere) than usual — places like the state of Colorado, the southeast of England and New South Wales. Pilots have circled their planes mid-flight to give their passengers a closer look at the phenomenon. A new solar event over the weekend caused colorful auroras Sunday night and Monday morning, and more can be expected Monday night, according to EarthSky. Auroras may be visible as far south as Alabama and northern California, according to NOAA’s Aurora Forecast. Check to see if your state might be one of many in the viewing area and the best ways to see auroras. Auroras are caused by activity on the sun — particularly a type of solar storm called a coronal mass ejection,  which emits electrified gas and particles into space. When these electrified particles reach magnetic field lines at the north and south poles, which usually takes around three days, they enter into Earth’s atmosphere. Once there, the particles and energy interact with gases in the atmosphere, producing different colored light in the sky. Oxygen gives off green, the most commonly seen color, as well as red light, according to Aurora Watch at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. Nitrogen glows blue and purple, according to NASA. Clear weather can also help make the auroras more visible. A severe geomagnetic storm was generated by a coronal mass ejection on April 21, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center is monitoring the event. The plasma ejected by the sun traveled at almost 2 million miles per hour toward Earth at 3:26 p.m. ET on April 23. Previously, researchers at NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory said they detected two M-class solar flares in March that led to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), triggering elevated geomagnetic activity and producing the captivating auroras. The smallest solar flares are designated A-class, followed by B, C, M and X, the largest, according to NASA. The CMEs can also sometimes disrupt satellite operations and communication on Earth. The recent uptick in geomagnetic activity in March was driven by a “large and magnetically complex” sun spot region known as AR3234, according to the UK’s Met Office. Over the next few years, the northern lights might appear further south more regularly, said Robert Massey, executive director at the Royal Astronomical Society. The sun goes through an 11-year solar cycle where the flare activity level fluctuates. Cycle 25, the latest one, began in December 2019 with a solar minimum — a period when the sun is still active, but it’s quieter and has fewer sunspots. We’re now approaching a solar maximum, expected to occur in July 2025, which will be a time when there are a large number of sunspots and increased solar activity. Massey said the solar events that cause auroras will become more common as we head toward the solar maximum. This month’s event is the third severe geomagnetic storm, following events in November 2021 and March 2023, since the new solar cycle began in 2019. “This increased activity from the sun is consistent with the current state and timing of the solar cycle,” said Rob Steenburgh, NOAA space scientist, in a statement. “Energetic events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections have become more frequent in the past year, and especially in the past month, and we expect activity to continue ramping up to the peak next year.” Other planets in the solar system also experience auroras. Jupiter is bathed in spectacular color at its poles, although its powerful auroras are caused by a different mechanism that those on Earth, according to research published in 2021.

      Russia’s Lavrov hosts UN meeting on ‘international peace,’ gets slammed by Western diplomats
    ","Western diplomats slammed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for his country’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine during a face-to-face session hosted by Moscow’s top diplomat at the United Nations Security Council on Monday. Lavrov was in charge of the meeting, titled “Maintenance of international peace and security,” because Russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council. The last time Russia presided over the Security Council was February 2022, when it launched its invasion of Ukraine. UN ambassadors for the United States, United Kingdom and Switzerland all used their speeches at the meeting to condemn Russia’s invasion. The three women – the US’s Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Britain’s Barbara Woodward and Switzerland’s Pascale Baeriswyl – all voiced strong, direct criticism of Russia and Lavrov, at times looking directly at the top Russian diplomat. “Our hypocritical convener today, Russia, invaded its neighbor, Ukraine, and struck at the heart of the UN Charter. This illegal, unprovoked and unnecessary war runs directly counter to our most shared principles – that a war of aggression and territorial conquest is never, ever acceptable,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “As we sit here, that aggression continues. As we sit here, Russian forces continue to kill and injure civilians. As we sit here, Russian forces are destroying Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. As we sit here we brace ourselves for the next Bucha, the next Mariupol, the next Kherson, the next war crime, the next atrocity,” she added. Opening the session, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned Russia’s actions. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, is causing massive suffering and devastation to the country and its people and adding to the global economic dislocation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said, sitting right next to Lavrov. Russian diplomats have been largely cut off from various international conferences since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. However, the leadership of the Security Council, UN’s most powerful body, rotates alphabetically among its 15 member nations. Five countries – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – have permanent seats on the council. The remaining 10 members are elected for two-year terms by the UN General Assembly. Russia assumed the presidency on April 1, an event that multiple diplomats described as an “April Fool’s joke.” The meeting on Monday was attended by Elizabeth Whelan, whose brother Paul Whelan has been detained in Russia for more than four years. The US considers Whelan to be wrongfully detained. The US government was unable to secure Whelan’s release last year when it brought home two other Americans who the US said had been wrongfully detained in Russia – Trevor Reed in April and Brittney Griner in December. European Union countries issued a joint statement before the meeting, condemning Russia’s actions in Ukraine and criticizing Lavrov’s appearance at the meeting. “Russia is trying to portray itself as a defender of the UN charter and multilateralism. Nothing can be further from the truth. It’s cynical,” said Olaf Skoog, European Union representative to the UN. “We all know that while Russia is destroying, we are building. While they violate, we protect.” In his opening remarks, Lavrov launched into a tirade of unsubstantiated accusations against Ukraine and its western allies, blaming the conflict on them. “As was the case during the Cold War, we have reached the dangerous, possibly even more dangerous threshold,” Lavrov said, accusing the “United States and its allies” of “abandoning diplomacy and demanding clarification of relations on the battlefield.” Lavrov repeatedly described the Ukrainian government as “the putchists” and “the Nazi Kyiv regime,” a baseless claim that Russia has repeatedly made to justify its illegal invasion of the country. Lavrov also criticized Western countries for not recognizing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea as Russian territory, despite “a referendum being held there.” Russia forcefully annexed Crimea in 2014 after holding a sham referendum there. Ukraine and its Western allies consider the area occupied Ukrainian territory. The UN overwhelmingly rejected the referendum as illegitimate and the annexation as illegal.

      Spain exhumes fascist founder’s body as sympathizers salute and sing
    ","Spain on Monday dug up the body of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of the fascist Falange movement that supported the Francoist regime, and removed it from a mausoleum carved into a mountainside near Madrid as sympathizers gave fascist salutes. A handful of supporters gathered outside the gates of the complex formerly known as the Valley of the Fallen made the gesture and held up banners saying “José Antonio is present” or shouted “Long live Spain” as his hearse drove past. Police struggled to hold back a larger crowd of about 150 Falange supporters gathered outside the San Isidro cemetery in southern Madrid, where he was to be reburied. They gave the fascist salute and sang the Falangist hymn “Facing the sun.” The exhumation, which follows the 2019 removal of the remains of dictator Francisco Franco, is part of a plan to convert the complex built by Franco, which last year was renamed the Valley of Cuelgamuros, into a memorial to the 500,000 people killed during Spain’s 1936-39 civil war.Presidency Minister Felix Bolaños on Friday hailed the exhumation as another step in giving the valley new symbolism. “No person or ideology that evokes the dictatorship should be honored or extolled there,” he said at the time. The son of dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, who governed Spain from 1923-1930, José Antonio was shot by firing squad in November 1936 by left-wing Republican forces in Alicante. It is the fifth time his body has been buried and the fourth time it has been exhumed. In 1939, after having lain in two different mass graves in Alicante, his coffin was paraded 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the eastern coastal city to San Lorenzo de El Escorial, a town near Madrid where Spain’s royals are buried. His remains were moved again on the completion of the Valley of the Fallen monument 20 years later and buried under the altar of the basilica, where Franco would join him on his death in 1975. Franco, a conservative general, and Primo de Rivera, a flamboyant playboy, had little love for each other, according to Franco’s biographer, Paul Preston. Franco sabotaged several efforts to organize a rescue or a prisoner swap that would have saved Primo de Rivera’s life, Preston wrote in his biography. His death allowed Franco to eliminate a rival and take control of the Falangists, subsuming them to a broader far-right movement that supported his dictatorship. The government is carrying out works in the mausoleum to permit access to the crypts where the remains of 34,000 people, many of them victims of Franco’s regime, are buried anonymously, allowing families to identify their relatives.

      Palestinian reporter breaks barriers by reporting in Hebrew on Israeli TV
    ","Sitting at the oversized crescent desk on a set lit up by massive screens, smartly-suited Suleiman Maswadeh fits right in with his colleagues at Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11. But between his name and very slight accent in Hebrew, it’s clear Maswadeh is something not often seen on Israeli television. He is one of the few Palestinian reporters who report in Hebrew, on Israeli TV. Maswadeh is not the first or the only Palestinian reporter on Israeli TV – there are several on the Arab affairs beat. But Maswadeh doesn’t cover only “Palestinian” stories. Recently promoted to political correspondent and anchor, he’s leaving his hometown of Jerusalem for the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv. All this by the age of 27, when only seven years ago, he did not even speak Hebrew. Speaking to CNN from Kan’s Jerusalem studios, Maswadeh said he lives his life now between worlds, feeling a constant internal debate and sometimes struggle, not only from being a reporter, but from the pressures of a community that doesn’t always approve of what he does. “I was born in East Jerusalem to a Palestinian family, to a Palestinian culture. I’m not ashamed to say that I’m Palestinian. But I also live in Israel and also feel Israeli in some ways,” Maswadeh said. “When people ask me, ‘who are you?’ I don’t know. I just say I come from Jerusalem and I’m a journalist. And that’s the two most important things of my identity.” From the Old City of Jerusalem, Maswadeh does not hold Israeli citizenship. He is one of the many Palestinians, mostly from East Jerusalem, who hold Israeli identity cards and residency, but a Jordanian passport. That passport, Maswadeh explained, is only a travel document that many Palestinians hold, and does not bestow Jordanian citizenship. He grew up in and around some of the most prominent and newsworthy places in the world. He attended a strict, all-boys Islamic school in the Old City, and played as a child in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound – known to Jews as the Temple Mount – the site of regular clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian Muslims that often trigger broader conflict. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in a 1967 war and now considers it, with West Jerusalem, as part of its “undivided capital.” Most of the international community however considers it to be occupied territory and the Palestinians want it as the capital of their future state. Maswadeh says his first interest in journalism came during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s, when there were frequent suicide bombings and other attacks in Jerusalem. “We were there looking at the TV – Israeli TV – and saw, you know, the smokes and people screaming and I didn’t know what’s happening, I didn’t speak Hebrew. I just looked at TV and I felt that I want to be there, like I want to report, I want to do something,” Maswadeh said. But his path to journalism was far from straightforward. While studying accounting at the Palestinian Birzeit University, Maswadeh worked at a high-end hotel in Jerusalem, where he said he quickly realized the mostly-Jewish waiters who spoke Hebrew made better money, because they would earn tips in the lobby where they could converse with the customers. “I decided to drop out of university and go find work because I told myself it’s better not to, you know, spend my years just working for nothing,” Maswadeh said. A friend tipped him off about a scholarship that would help him learn Hebrew in under a year. He then transferred to an Israeli college, where he studied journalism – and landed an internship at Kan’s Arabic channel. After a few months, he moved to the main Hebrew channel and worked as a field producer. His first on-air role was as Arab affairs reporter. “I really hated that. I don’t know why, it’s just I saw that all the Arab reporters, or most of the Arab reporters in Israel, report about the Arab society or something and I didn’t like that,” Maswadeh said. “I said that I can be a reporter that covers Arabs and Jews, I can cover the police and we can cover Knesset [the Israeli Parliament] or cover the prime minister’s office as any other Jewish journalist.” It was as Jerusalem correspondent that Maswadeh really made his mark, reporting from Palestinian refugee camps during police raids, on protests in East Jerusalem between Israelis and Palestinians, and on Israeli politics. He’s been a mainstay of recent coverage of the massive protests against the Israeli government’s planned judicial overhaul, and has even sat down with the extreme right-wing figures of Israel’s new government, like National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who was once convicted of racist incitement against Arabs and supporting terrorism. If at first he thought his background would hinder his ability to report on all the complex, intertwined and tense sectors of Jerusalem, Maswadeh said, instead he feels it has opened the city up for him. “When we have stories in East Jerusalem, actually the fact that I’ve come from there and people know me and people hear me, speak their language … it makes them feel comfortable talking to me and has given me access as well,” Maswadeh said. “I come to the [Israeli] police officers, I tell them my story and they see that I can understand both the Arab society and also the Jewish society, which gives me access to police officers as well. So if at the beginning I thought that it’s going to restrict me – being an Arab, or you know, covering Jerusalem as an Arab – it actually was the other way.” But one of his first major scoops as Jerusalem correspondent laid bare what he says is a “constant dilemma” – reporting on when “something bad happened in my society.” In 2020, Maswadeh revealed how Covid-19 restrictions were being violated at the Al-Aqsa mosque. Worshippers were crowding inside the mosque, many, if not most, without masks, according to his report. “I remember my grandfather calling me and telling me that everyone there is talking to him and telling him that what his grandson did was a shame to the community. And I should, you know, just leave my job right now,” Maswadeh said. “I told him, ‘it might be bad what I did, but I wouldn’t forgive myself if you died because your son prayed there and he came back and sat with you (at) dinner and infected you’.” The pressure from his family hasn’t let up, he says. “Every day that I go to a Friday dinner with my family they told me ‘Please just leave the job. Just leave it. We love seeing you on TV, it gives us a lot of pride, but you can’t do this anymore,’” Maswadeh said. Maswadeh said he gets death threats for his work, and sometimes goes into the field with security. He now only visits his parents at night. “I get threats from both sides [Palestinian and Israeli], but it was mainly from Palestinians who don’t like the fact that I work for Israeli TV,” he added. He says he tells his detractors that his presence in the newsroom and on Israeli TV helps bring the Palestinian voice to a place where it’s missing. “Sometimes when I go to the field I get people threatening me that I have to leave because I work for an occupying system. My answer to that is, this is where you make things different.

      Death toll in Kenyan starvation cult rises to 58, police say
    ","Kenyan police have recovered 58 bodies from mass graves in the Shakahola forest in eastern Kenya, thought to be followers of a Christian cult who believed they would go to heaven if they starved themselves, the country’s police chief said on Monday. The death toll, which has been rising steadily over the past two days as exhumations have been carried out, could rise further as the Kenyan Red Cross has said 112 people have been reported missing to a tracing desk it operates. The cult was called the Good News International Church and its leader, Paul Mackenzie, was arrested following a tip-off that suggested the existence of shallow graves containing the bodies of at least 31 of his followers. Police near the coastal town of Malindi started exhuming bodies on Friday from the Shakahola forest. Earlier this month, police rescued 15 members of the group – worshippers at the church – who they said had been told to starve themselves to death. Four of them died before they reached hospital, police said. Local media, citing police sources, reported that Mackenzie has refused to eat or drink while in police custody. Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the entire 800 acre forest had been sealed off and declared a scene of crime. “This horrendous blight on our conscience must lead not only to the most severe punishment of the perpetrator(s) of the atrocity on so many innocent souls, but tighter regulation (including self-regulation) of every church, mosque, temple or synagogue going forward,” he said.

      Rival generals are battling for control in Sudan. Here’s a simple guide to the fighting
    ","Fierce fighting across Sudan has left hopes for a peaceful transition to civilian rule in tatters. Forces loyal to two rival generals are vying for control, and as is so often the case civilians have suffered the most, with dozens killed and hundreds injured. Doctors’ organizations and several eyewitnesses said medical facilities were being bombarded with military strikes in targeted attacks, as clashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary ramped up for the third day. Both sides later denied shelling hospitals, in comments to CNN. Here’s what you need to know. At the heart of the clashes are two men: Sudan’s military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. Until recently, they were allies. The pair worked together to topple ousted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and played a pivotal role in the military coup in 2021. However, tensions arose during negotiations to integrate the RSF into the country’s military as part of plans to restore civilian rule. The key question: who would be subordinate to who under the new hierarchy. These hostilities, sources told CNN, are the culmination of what both parties view as an existential fight for dominance. It is difficult to overstate how seismic Bashir’s overthrow was. He had led the country for nearly three decades when popular protests that began over soaring bread prices toppled him from power. During his rule, South Sudan split from the north while the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Bashir alleged war crimes in Darfur, a separatist Western region. After Bashir’s ouster, Sudan was ruled by an uneasy alliance between the military and civilian groups. That all ended in 2021, when the power-sharing government was dissolved by armed forces. The Rapid Support Forces are the preeminent paramilitary group in Sudan, whose leader, Dagalo, has enjoyed a rapid rise to power. During Sudan’s Darfur conflict in the early 2000s, he was the leader of Sudan’s notorious Janjaweed forces, implicated in human rights violations and atrocities. An international outcry saw Bashir formalize the group into paramilitary forces known as the Border Intelligence Units. In 2007, its troops became part of the country’s intelligence services and, in 2013, Bashir created the RSF, a paramilitary group overseen by him and led by Dagalo. Dagalo turned against Bashir in 2019, but not before his forces opened fire on an anti-Bashir, pro-democracy sit-in in Khartoum, killing at least 118 people. He was later appointed deputy of the transitional Sovereign Council that ruled Sudan in partnership with civilian leadership. Burhan is essentially Sudan’s leader. At the time of Bashir’s toppling, Burhan was the army’s inspector general. His career has run an almost parallel course to Dagalo’s. He also rose to prominence in the 2000’s for his role in the dark days of the Darfur conflict, where the two men are believed to have first came into contact. Al-Burhan and Dagalo both cemented their rise to power by currying favor with the Gulf powerhouses. They commanded separate battalions of Sudanese forces, who were sent to serve with the Saudi-led coalition forces in Yemen. Now they find themselves locked in a power struggle. Speaking with CNN, Burhan, characterized the RSF offensive as an “attempted coup.” “This is an attempted coup and rebellion against the state,” Burhan told CNN by phone. He said that RSF leader Dagalo had “mutinied” against the state, and if captured, would be tried in court of law. Burhan alleged in the CNN interview that the RSF had tried to “capture me and kill me.” When asked about that claim, an RSF spokesperson told CNN that the group was “seeking to capture him” and bring him to justice for “many treasons acts against the Sudanese people.” “We are fighting for all Sudanese people,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We [are] going to bring all responsible parties to justice and give them a fair trial.” When challenged on why the Sudanese people should trust him, given his former alliance with Dagalo, Burhan told CNN: “The Sudanese Army is the people’s army. “It is not owned by specific people or specific organizations,” he said. “It is a national institution, which is tasked with defending Sudan.” Where the fighting will end is unclear. Both sides claim control over key sites and fighting has been reported across the country in places far from the capital Khartoum. While various official and non-official estimates place the Sudanese armed forces at around 210-220,000, the RSF are believed to number approximately 70,000 but are better trained and better equipped. International powers have expressed alarm, with the UN Security Council holding its first meeting on the crisis in Sudan on Monday. Apart from concerns over civilians there are likely other motivations at play – Sudan is resource-rich and strategically located. CNN has previously reported on how Russia has colluded with Sudan’s military leaders to smuggle gold out of Sudan. Dagalo’s forces were a key recipient of Russian training and weaponry, and Sudan’s military leader Burhan is also believed by CNN’s Sudanese sources to have been backed by Russia, before international pressure forced him to publicly disavow the presence of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, in Sudan. Sudan’s neighbors Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate, but in the meantime all that is certain is more misery for the Sudanese people.

      Son of Kremlin spokesman Peskov says he served in Ukraine
    ","The son of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Nikolai Peskov, claimed in an interview with Russian media that he decided to serve in Ukraine with Russia’s Wagner mercenary force. “I considered it my duty… I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and watch friends and other people go there,” Peskov said in an interview with Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. “When I went there, I had to change my last name. Nobody really knew who I was.” He said he served for nearly six months and received the Medal for Courage. CNN could not independently verify the claims. Children of government figures and Russia’s elite have received criticism in the past for failing to fight in Ukraine. Nikolai Peskov’s interview comes after the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Friday that the Kremlin spokesperson’s son had served as a gunner with his mercenary force. Prigozhin did not specify what period of time he was talking about. According to Prigozhin, Nikolai Peskov served in PMC Wagner for six months under false documents with a different last name, working as a loader of an ammunition supply vehicle.

      Japan approves first abortion pill, decades after other countries
    ","A panel in Japan’s health ministry has approved the country’s first abortion pill, in a major step for reproductive rights decades after other countries made abortion medication widely available. The ministry’s pharmaceutical board granted approval on Friday to the MeFeego Pack, an abortion pill manufactured by British pharmaceutical Linepharma, according to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The ministry had first convened in January to review the drug, before asking for the public to submit their opinions through an online portal. It will now go to the health minister for final approval. The medication consists of two types of pill, and can be used within nine weeks of pregnancy, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. In a clinical trial in Japan, 93% of participants had a complete abortion within 24 hours, NHK reported. The medication combines mifepristone and misoprostol, which the World Health Organization has included in its Essential Medicines List, described as safe and effective for pregnant people. To date, only surgical abortion is available in Japan through two methods: the curettage method, which removes tissue inside the uterus with a metal instrument, and the evacuation method, which sucks out tissue through a tube, according to NHK. The WHO has described curettage as an “obsolete” method that is less safe and much more painful, and has called for it to be replaced by the evacuation method or by medication like abortion pills. The move also comes as abortion and reproductive rights have gained revived attention worldwide, with the US Supreme Court reversing overturned Roe v. Wade last year – ruling that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion. Since then, a number of states have restricted access to abortions, while others moved to increase access. The Japanese panel’s decision on Friday was celebrated by the country’s medical experts online. Kanako Inaba, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, wrote on Twitter that the approval of abortion pills was an opportunity to spread greater sex education and awareness about contraceptive methods. Japanese activists have been pushing for years for approval of the pills, with similar medications made available decades ago in other countries as Japan lagged ever further behind. For instance, mifepristone was first approved in France in 1988, and in the US in 2000. But others also pointed to the long road ahead, calling for greater protection for women. Mihyon Song, another well-known Japanese obstetrician and gynaecologist, pointed to Japan’s controversial abortion laws, which require spousal consent – which activists have long argued denies women the right to make decisions on their own body. Under Japan’s existing laws, women can only receive an abortion if a pregnancy “may significantly damage the person’s physical health due to bodily or economic reasons” or if they became pregnant due to rape.

      Italian minister sparks fury for saying immigration leads to ‘ethnic replacement’
    ","The brother-in-law and close political ally of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has warned that Italy’s low birth rate and an increase in irregular immigration could lead to “ethnic replacement,” sparking anger from the country’s opposition. Francesco Lollobrigida remarks comes in response to a recent report which found Italy has one of the world’s lowest birthrates with fewer than 400,000 births in 2022. He made the comments at a conference on Tuesday, where he said that incentives to have more babies, suggested by Meloni, did not mean women had to stay home to raise them. “The way is to build a welfare system that allows you to work and have a family, supporting young couples to find employment,” he said. “Italians are having fewer children, so we’re replacing them with someone else. Yes to helping births, no to ethnic replacement. That’s not the way forward.” Elly Schlein, the new head of Italy’s Democratic Party, described Lollobrigida’s statement as “disgusting” and “reminiscent of the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.” She accused Lollobrigida of reverting to the mentality of the 1930s, saying his words “have a flavor of white supremacism.” Speaking to reporters at a protest against the state of emergency against migrants in Rome, Schlein added that she hopes Meloni’s government distances itself from the statements, “made on the day when President (Sergio) Mattarella is visiting Auschwitz.” Lollobrigida said that while he was not against controlled immigration, noting his grandfather emigrated to Italy, irregular migration is a threat. “If there are requests for a workforce, when you have exhausted the internal demand, you can, you must provide a workforce that also comes from other countries. It must be clarified that the first enemy of regular immigration, made through organized flows, is illegal and clandestine immigration,” he said. Meloni’s spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and she has yet to make a public statement. Matteo Salvini, a junior partner in Meloni’s coalition of far-right and center-right parties, had previously tweeted about the threat of “ethnic replacement” in 2017, and Meloni had used the term in political speeches in 2016. Italy has had a record number of arrivals by sea this year, with 34,715 people arriving as of April 19, according to the Interior ministry. Far right White supremacist groups and conservative media personalities in both Europe and the US have been widely condemned in recent years for attempting to inflame nativist feelings among conservative White populations by warning that immigrants are “replacing” native born populations. Replacement theory was first popularized by French writer Renaud Camus with his 2011 essay, “Le Grand Remplacement,” which posited White Europeans were being replaced by Muslim immigration.

      One of the last survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto resistance tells of the bravery of those who dared to stand up against the Nazis
    ","One of the last surviving members of the Warsaw Ghetto resistance has told CNN the world must never forget the bravery of those who stood up to the Nazis, 80 years after World War II’s largest Jewish uprising. On April 19, 1943, a group of Polish Jews fought back against their German occupiers in what became known as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The fighters, though small in number and lacking in resources, dared to defy the odds. While the uprising lasted just a month, it is remembered today as a heroic act of Jewish defiance during the Holocaust. Established by the Germans in October 1940, the Warsaw Ghetto was the largest Jewish ghetto in German-occupied Europe. About 400,000 Jews were sealed off from the rest of the Polish capital behind a high wall topped with barbed wire. Though just 15 by the time of the uprising, Aliza Vitis-Shomron – then known by her maiden name, Melamed – was actively engaged in the resistance through her involvement with a youth movement within the ghetto. She told CNN that she acted as a messenger, warning the Jews forced to live there that the Nazis were planning to liquidate it. Speaking to CNN from the World Holocaust Remembrance Center at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem on Wednesday, Vitis-Shomron said she and her fellow couriers acted like “the television, radio or newspapers which we didn’t have.” Find out more: Remembering the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the people who fought back “We would spread the news to different parts of the ghetto,” she said. “I would sometimes take leaflets of news and orders and would hide them under my clothes on my body so that the Germans wouldn’t catch me when they searched me. “The messengers were not fighters but had a very important mission to complete. It was very dangerous and we knew it,” she said. Her parents had forbidden Vitis-Shomron to be involved, but she carried on, determined to play her part. Two days before the uprising erupted, the teenager escaped the ghetto with her mother and 10-year-old sister by climbing over a wall. Vitis-Shomron hadn’t wanted to leave. “I wanted to stay and fight with my fellow fighters,” she told CNN, explaining that she had sought the advice of one of the commanders within the resistance movement. “I told her that my parents wanted me to leave the ghetto and that they had found a hiding place for me. She told me that I should go because she said ‘we need someone to survive to tell our story.’” “She knew that if I stayed I would not survive and it was more important to her that someone would be left alive to tell the story and because of that I agreed to leave the ghetto,” said Vitis-Shomron, who made a commitment to tell the world what had happened after she escaped with her mother and sister on April 17. The uprising began just two days later, after German troops and police stormed the ghetto in an attempt to deport the surviving inhabitants to concentration camps. They were unprepared for the resistance they met from the ghetto’s Jewish inhabitants and the urban revolt lasted for a month. About 700 young Jewish fighters participated in the uprising, which also saw the ghetto’s civilian population resist by refusing to assemble at collection points and hiding in underground bunkers. Vitis-Shomron recalled: “The uprising broke out two days later and I was on the other side. I remember seeing the fires over the ghetto walls and the sky glowed red and black from the fires and smoke.” But by May 16 the uprising had been crushed. At least 7,000 Jews died fighting or in hiding in the ghetto, while a similar number were captured and deported to concentration camps and extermination centers. Among them was Vitis-Shomron’s father, Simcha Melamed, who was trapped within the ghetto. He was later deported to the Majdanek concentration camp, where he was murdered on November 3, 1943. Vitis-Shomron, her sister and their mother were eventually captured and sent to Bergen-Belsen – where they remained until US forces liberated the camp at the end of the war. A mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, Vitis-Shomron lives today on Kibbutz Givat Oz in northern Israel. She has spent her life speaking publicly about her experiences. In 1945, she emigrated to what was then Palestine, after losing more than 70 members of her family in the Holocaust. She told CNN: “It is important for me to tell the story, not so much my story, but how we fought bravely. If we don’t tell the world how we Jews fought, the world will only look at us as victims who went like lambs to the slaughter. “But we did fight and we did it in so many different ways. We need to tell people the truth.” Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem, told CNN that there were “countless instances of Jewish solidarity” during World War II. He said: “The Warsaw Ghetto uprising has become the iconic representation of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust. “But not all resistance was physical fighting. Resistance was spiritual, cultural, educational and religious. It was the basic human desire to maintain dignity even in the context of the harshest realities imaginable. These actions are not self-evident in the reality of the harsh persecution and ultimate extermination that the Jews suffered during the Holocaust. This anniversary marks all of that bravery and heroism.” ",907,europe,2023-04-19,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/europe/warsaw-ghetto-survivor-scli-intl/index.html

      Russia having difficulty making new weapons, but might have enough older ones, report says
    ","Battlefield losses and Western sanctions have left the Russian military in a state of decline, but Moscow will still have enough firepower to extend the war in Ukraine, according to a new independent analysis. The report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies gives stark numbers of Russian military losses – almost 10,000 units of key equipment such as tanks, trucks, artillery pieces and aerial drones, according to one estimate. But it also says Russia can dip into Cold War-era and older stocks on the front lines to make up in numbers what it may have lost in technology. “The quality of the Russian military in terms of advanced equipment will likely decline, at least over the near term,” the CSIS report says. It notes how Russian losses of main battle tanks, especially modern ones, have been severe. “Moscow is estimated to have lost anywhere from 1,845 to 3,511 tanks one year into the war,” the CSIS report says, with losses of its newer, upgraded T-72B3 main battle tank, first delivered in 2013, noted as especially damaging. The Netherlands-based open source intelligence website Oryx says it has visual evidence of more than 500 variants of T-72B3 destroyed, damaged, abandoned or captured as of this week. Western officials, speaking during a briefing Tuesday, also noted the pressure on the Russian tank fleet. “They’re going backwards in terms of equipment,” the officials said of Russian armor, noting that T-55 tanks, introduced in 1948, are now turning up on the battlefield. The CSIS report highlights the problem Russia faces in new tank construction, citing Russian media reports. One tank plant, UralVagonZavod, can make about 20 tanks a month. But Russia loses, on average, almost 150 tanks of all types in Ukraine each month, it says. And then there’s the lack of modern hardware. The CSIS report says Moscow has to refurbish and put its decades-old tanks back into action because it just doesn’t have the resources to build new ones, with Western sanctions leaving it unable to source parts and tools needed to put together a modern tank. Sanctions have cut Russian access to optical systems – needed for tank gunners to pick out targets – ball bearings and machine tools, the CSIS report said. Specifically for optical systems, Russia relied on French imports during its pre-war production, the report said. With those imports cut off by sanctions, it’s forced to put older, less sophisticated gunner’s sights in even its most modern tanks, resulting in a possible loss of up to two kilometers in range, it said. In the case of high-quality ball bearings – “critical to producing any type of moving vehicle,” the report said – 55% of Russia’s pre-war supply came from Europe and North America. With those sources now lost, it may try to make up the deficit with domestically produced supplies or imports of lower quality from China or Malaysia, the report said. Either way, Russia can’t get the quality it did before the war. “Moscow is under pressure to adapt, often turning to less-reliable and costlier suppliers and supply routes, lower-quality imports, or trying to reproduce Western components internally. This is likely hampering the rate and quality of Russian defense production,” the report said. The loss of Western components is not just felt in tanks, the report says. Manned and unmanned aircraft, missiles and electronic warfare equipment need modern, high-tech parts – including microchips – that Russian can’t source adequately from internal suppliers and has difficulty importing because of Western sanctions, it said. But the report cautions that Ukraine and its Western supporters should not expect these supply problems to quickly stop the hostilities. “Sanctions and export controls are not a silver bullet that will force Russia to bring the war to an end,” it said. Russia still retains numerical advantages over Ukraine, the report said, because it has large inventories in reserve. “Russia’s military capabilities still greatly outnumber those of Ukraine on most indicators, including man-, air-, land, and naval power,” the report says. “While an accurate count of Moscow’s current military stocks is not available publicly, it has been roughly estimated that, as of February 2023, the total number of aircraft at the Kremlin’s disposal has been 13-15 times more than Kyiv’s. Russia has nearly 7-8 times more tanks and 4 times more armored fighting vehicles, while its naval fleet is 12-16 times larger than Ukraine’s,” it says. The numerical advantages will enable Moscow to run a war of attrition over the next year, throwing numbers on the battlefield until Ukraine, even with fewer losses, runs out of hardware, the report says. To offset the Russian numerical advantages, even of inferior weaponry, it is vital that Western countries keep technologically superior armaments flowing to Ukraine. For instance, the older tanks are vulnerable to hand-held Javelin missiles, it says. “This is the crux of this war in its second year: the Russian military can rely on its mass and continue feeding older or less than state-of-the-art technology as long as it thinks it can simply outlast the Western deliveries of weapons and systems to Ukraine,” the CSIS report says.

      Two Russians claiming to be former Wagner commanders admit killing children and civilians in Ukraine
    ","Two Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time in Ukraine. The claims were made in video interviews with Gulagu.net, a human rights organization targeting corruption and torture in Russia. In the video interviews posted online, former Russian convicts Azamat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev – who were both pardoned by Russian presidential decrees last year, according to Gulagu.net – described their actions in Ukraine, during Russia’s invasion. CNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022. Uldarov, who appears to have been drinking, details how he shot and killed a five- or six-year-old girl. “(It was) a management decision. I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said. According to Gulagu.net, the testimonies were given to founder and Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin over the span of a week. It said Uldarov and Savichev were in Russia when they spoke. “I want Russia and other nations to know the truth. I don’t want war and bloodshed. You see I’m holding a cigarette in this hand. I followed orders with this hand and killed children,” Uldarov said, describing his motivation for the interview. The Wagner Group is a Russian private mercenary organization fighting in Ukraine, headed by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin. It has recruited tens of thousands of fighters from Russian jails, offering freedom and cash after a six-month tour. It’s estimated by Western intelligence officials and prison advocacy groups that between 40,000 and 50,000 men were recruited. Uldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut – which have seen some of the fiercest fighting – Wagner mercenaries “were given the command to annihilate everyone.” “There is a superior over all the commanders – it’s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,” he added. CNN has previously reported on former Wagner fighters making similar claims. Uldarov has since appeared to recant his account in a video call with Prigozhin-linked Russian news agency RIA-FAN. At one point in the interview, Savichev described how they “got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.” He also talked about getting orders to ‘sweep’ a house. “It doesn’t matter whether there is a civilian there or not. The house needs to be swept. I didn’t give a f**k who was inside,” he said. “Whether a hut or a house, the point was to make sure that there wasn’t a single living person left inside,” he said. “You can condemn me for this. I will not object. It’s your right. But I wanted to live, too.” Savichev said Wagner fighters who did not follow orders were killed. Wagner Group chief Prigozhin confirmed on his Telegram channel that he had watched parts of the video, and threatened retribution against the two former Wagner fighters. “As for what (Osechkin) filmed, I looked at the pieces of video I managed to see,” he said. “I can say the following: if at least one of these accusations against me is confirmed, I am ready to be held accountable according to any laws.” But Prigozhin said that “if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a ‘fair trial,’ so to speak.” “They will not be “civilians” for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. This is a flagrant lie. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.” Earlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: “Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.” Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable. “Russian terrorists confessed to numerous murders of Ukrainian children in Bakhmut and Soledar. Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be. How many more crimes like these have been committed?” he said. In February, CNN spoke to two former Wagner fighters who described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. Deserters, or those who refuse orders are killed and there was no evacuation of the wounded, they said. In January, US Treasury Department designated Wagner Group as a significant transnational criminal organization, and imposed a slew of fresh sanctions on a transnational network that supports it. The US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to “target a range of Wagner’s key infrastructure – including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies,” according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

      Two men claiming to be ex-Wagner fighters said they killed civilians in Ukraine. One recanted. Wagner is looking for the other
    ","A Russian man who said he had killed children and other civilians while serving with the Wagner private military company in Ukraine appears to have recanted the claim, suggesting he was blackmailed into making it. Azamat Uldarov, a former convict, made his retraction in a video call with Russian news agency RIA-FAN. It’s unclear if there were any conditions to the interview. He and another former convict, Alexey Savichev, previously gave long and rambling interviews to Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, saying they were among the tens of thousands of Wagner fighters recruited from Russian jails to fight in Ukraine. Speaking with Gulagu founder Vladimir Osechkin, Uldarov said he shot and killed a young girl, calling it “a management decision.” “I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said, estimating that the girl was five or six years old. In his interview with RIA-FAN – which is associated with Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin – Uldarov said he was drunk when he gave the interview, and alleged that Osechkin had blackmailed him about his time in prison. Asked by RIA-FAN: “They made you say what you said in the video, correct?” Uldarov replied: “Not only correct, it’s [expletive] correct. I had to say it because I had no choice.” “I said whatever I was told to say,” Uldarov then said. “Prigozhin is a great guy,” he added, giving a thumbs up. “He saved our lives.” He also claimed – without specifying who – that “they have a video of me,” adding: “They are exploiting me, using my past life and my previous conviction.” The call appeared to end with Uldarov saying: “What was said there was said under dictation. Is this enough? Have you got enough?” But Gulagu’s Osechkin, who is based in France, told CNN he stood by the content of his interviews with the two men, citing Uldarov’s retraction as proof of how quickly dissenting voices are silenced in Russia. Osechkin also claimed that both interviewees, Uldarov and Savichev, had been threatened with murder if they didn’t retract their statements to him. Savichev told Gulagu that his unit was ordered to kill any men 15 years old or older. Wagner has been seeking Savichev for the past 24 hours, according to Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. Savichev “must get in touch with the Wagner PMC call center, and I guarantee that he will not be persecuted, neither judicially nor otherwise. He must get in touch with the Wagner PMC call center and explain why he provided this falsehood, who is behind it, how he was blackmailed and whether he was given any other objectives,” Prighozhin said in a statement on social media app Telegram. “Get in touch with the Wagner PMC call center, come, tell us everything. I guarantee that you will leave safe and sound,” he added. In another statement, Prigozhin said that according to “information we are receiving from convicts and former convicts, a group of people including former convicts and Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) employees, are actively cooperating with foreign groups including Gulagu.net.” Prigozhin claimed: “This group collects compromising material on convicts and former convicts,” and he suggested that they might react by committing “quite major unlawful acts as a result of their recruitment, such as assassination of various persons protecting the interests of the Russian Federation, acts of sabotage including in frontline areas, and acts of sabotage and terrorism in the Russian Federation.” Osechkin refuted the allegation and told CNN he believed Prigozhin is doing his best to avoid criminal responsibility for Wagner fighters’ conduct.

      One-fifth of water pollution comes from textile dyes. But a shellfish-inspired solution could clean it up
    ","Every year, the textile industry uses 1.3 trillion gallons of water to dye garments – enough to fill 2 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Most of this water, loaded with harmful chemicals and dyes, flows untreated into rivers and streams. That’s why researchers at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), have created a new nanomaterial that they say can clean up these dyes and other pollutants from industrial wastewater. The material consists of tiny sand-like grains, only visible to the naked-eye in clusters, which collect pollutants on their surfaces and in their pores, says Enas Nashef, project lead and a professor of chemical engineering at Khalifa University. The nanomaterial consists of a substance called a polymer that mimics the “glue” that mussels use to stick themselves to rocks, combined with a solvent. Finding the right solvent was a challenge, says Nashef, because most solvents are toxic, but the team identified one which is both effective and, crucially, eco-friendly. “If the thing you use will pollute the water, then what is the benefit?” he says. The team tested their nanomaterial on a red-orange dye called Alizarin Red S, and published their findings earlier this year. “So far, there are no toxic effects,” says Nashef, adding that the polymer can be cleaned of the pollutants and then reused. “We’re looking at the efficiency and also the environment at the same time,” he says. While the textile industry is one of the biggest contributors to industrial wastewater, it’s not alone: manufacturing, mining, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and agriculture all add to the problem. The United Nations estimates that globally, nearly 95 trillion gallons of wastewater are produced every year – roughly equivalent to 41 years of drinking water for the entire human population. A landmark report, published last month by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), found that just 20% of wastewater is currently treated, with far less being recycled, contributing to a global shortage of clean water. The report anticipates that demand for freshwater will outstrip supply by 40% by 2030. The textiles industry accounts for up to 20% of industrial wastewater globally – one of the reasons that Nashef and his team decided to focus their efforts on dyes. They targeted “anionic dyes,” because there are not many effective methods to remove these types of dye from water. Nashef’s hopes his high-efficiency material can make a dent in the sector’s dirty wastewater problem. “Right now, they can treat the (other) dyes, but with the anionic dye, they are facing problems,” says Nashef. “So they will need (this nanomaterial) to treat it.” Now that the mussel-inspired nanomaterial has shown promising results in the lab, Nashef is looking for industrial partners, to test it in the field. He also hopes to devise solutions for cleaning more than just textile dyes from water. Nashef is developing another nanomaterial that he says could remove viruses from hospital wastewater – an innovation that could help manage the spread of future pandemics. These water-cleaning polymers could also help to make desalination processes more sustainable – an important factor in the Middle East, where freshwater sources are scarce. Desalination plants consume a lot of energy to remove salt from water. Nashef says that using membrane-based nanomaterials in pre-treatment could cut the energy needed to clean the water. “If we can target that, it will reduce the load on the desalination plants,” Nashef adds. Ultimately Nashef hopes his work in his lab will have a real-world positive impact on water supplies – and “do something for the next generation.” ",593,middleeast,2023-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/middleeast/textile-wastewater-pollutant-cleaner-hnk-scn-spc-intl/index.html

      ‘People sacrificed their lives for just 10 dollars’: At least 78 killed in Yemen crowd surge
    ","Dozens of people were killed in a crowd surge in Yemen’s capital on Wednesday as needy residents in the war-torn nation flocked to receive charity handouts from local merchants during the holy month of Ramadan, officials have confirmed. Video of the tragedy in Sanaa showed a chaotic scene with dozens of people packed tightly together, unable to move and shouting for help. Those trapped formed a tangled wall of bodies with some desperately stretching out their arms for help. A couple of men who were freed could then be seen attempting to pull others out of the deadly crush. Images from the aftermath showed shoes and slippers heaped into piles as well as scarfs strewn on the floor. “What happened tonight is a tragic and painful accident, as dozens of people were killed due to a large stampede of a number of citizens caused by a random distribution of sums of money by some merchants and without coordination with the Ministry of Interior,” the spokesman of the Houthi-run Ministry of Interior, Abdul-Khaleq al-Ajri, said in the statement. At least 78 people were killed in the crush and dozens injured, Mutahar al-Marouni, the director of the Houthi-run Health office in Sanaa, told the Houthi-run Al-Masirah news agency. According to Reuters, hundreds of people had crowded into a school to receive donations of about $9. The incident came just a few days ahead of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. During this time of the month, people start giving away Zakat al-Fitr, or the Zakat of Breaking the Fast of Ramadan, to people who are in need. Naseh Shaker, a journalist who was at the scene, told CNN there was a “very long line of people” gathered at the entrance to the school, which was being used for distributing food and financial aid. They had begun queuing after sunset with the hopes of receiving the donation, he said. When officials in charge of the distribution arrived and opened the door, “a lot of people rushed into the school.” “This is a disaster to find people sacrificed their lives for just 10 dollars,” Shaker said. “People are very hungry people are very poor.” Another eyewitness who was inside the school when the crush happened told Houthi media that more than 3,000 people had gathered to collect donations, and that they were all “standing, pushing and climbing on top of each other.” “We tried reasoning with them, told them to go back. But there were too many people,” he said. Police and rescue teams rushed to the scene, according to the Interior Ministry statement. “The dead and injured people were transferred to hospitals, and two merchants in charge of the matter were arrested,” the statement added. The head of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, Mahdi Al-Mashat, ordered an investigation into the incident on Thursday. The Houthi-run General Authority for Zakat announced in a statement it would give one million Yemeni Riyal (about $4,000) to each family of the crowd surge victims. It also said it would take care of the treatment of those injured and pay 200,000 Yemeni Riyal (about $800) to each injured person. The stampede and its overwhelming death toll reflect the current poverty rate in Yemen, said Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. “Poverty rates have greatly increased and there are more people in need,” Nagi told CNN. “The merchant who used to help 1,000 or 2,000 people now has to help 5,000 or 10,000 people.” And while the humanitarian situation is dire all over Yemen, it is particularly bad in Houthi-held areas, he said, noting that nearly 65% of Yemen’s population is under Houthi control. Houthis deal with the economic problems in areas under their control “as if they are not responsible,” attributing the different crises plaguing their cities to the war, the blockade, or other foreign actors in Yemen, Nagi said. “Assistance is not enough,” he said, “And the authorities are not concerned with society’s conditions … that is the root cause of the problem.” A top Houthi official last week told CNN that talks with the Saudis were focused on meeting the Houthis’ humanitarian demands, such as removing the blockade on ports, opening Yemen’s airspace and paying the salaries of public sector employees. Yemeni journalist Shaker said Wednesday’s tragedy was the result of years of economic desperation and the international community should “act now” to stop the war. “People are no longer killed by air strikes or by shelling of warring parties. Now they are dying because they are rushing to get food,” he said. Yemen has been described by the UN as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nine years of war have killed thousands, destroyed the economy and left 21.6 million people – two-thirds of the country’s population – in dire need of humanitarian assistance. Tens of thousands of Yemenis are living in famine, according to the UN. The country’s conflict began as a civil war in 2014, when Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government. It spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis. But it eventually became a proxy war between Iran – which has been accused of arming the Houthis – and Saudi Arabia, and the main arena for their competition for regional influence. On Sunday, a Saudi delegation arrived in Sanaa for talks with the Houthis aimed at securing a permanent ceasefire. Last Friday, negotiations bore their biggest fruits yet with a three-day prisoner swap of nearly 900 detainees from both sides. Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam tweeted on Friday that talks had been “serious and positive.” ",963,middleeast,2023-04-19,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/middleeast/yemen-sanaa-crowd-surge-intl/index.html

      Israeli police say two men shot near Jewish tomb in Jerusalem in suspected ‘terror attack’
    ","Two men have been wounded in what Israeli police say was a suspected “terror attack” that took place near the Shimon Hatzadik tomb in East Jerusalem early Tuesday local time. A police statement said the force received a report of a shooting at a vehicle in the area of Shimon Hatzadik, which is located in East Jerusalem where tensions between Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been simmering in recent years. The Shimon Hatzadik tomb is a revered holy site in Judaism located in the largely Palestinian neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem. Two people were “moderately injured,” according to medical officials and were transferred for further medical treatment, the police statement added. “Police and Border Police officers are at the scene conducting searches for the suspect who fled the scene,” it continued. In a follow-up statement, police said forces located a “Carlo” style submachine gun near the site of the shooting. A spokesperson for the Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service the two injured men involved a 50-year-old male who was sent to be treated in Shaare Tzedek Hospital and a 48-year-old to Hadassah Mt. Scopus Hospital. The attack comes amid escalating Israeli-Palestinian violence. Last year was the deadliest for both Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and for Israelis in nearly two decades, and this year is on pace to be worse. Tensions have boiled over during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which coincided this year with the Jewish Passover holiday, after Israeli police twice raided the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, whose compound is also known as the Temple Mount – one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism. Israeli police arrested hundreds whom they accused of barricading themselves inside the mosque and throwing fireworks and stones, leading to wide condemnations from the Arab and Muslim world. The complex and the neighborhood where Tuesday’s shooting took place lies in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state and which most of the international community considers to be Israeli-occupied territory. Israel captured it from Jordan in a 1967 war and considers both East and West Jerusalem as its united, “eternal capital.” ",360,middleeast,2023-04-18,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/middleeast/jerusalem-shimon-hatzadik-tomb-attack-intl-hnk/index.html

      Houthis try to reassure skeptics they won’t seek full control of Yemen, as Saudis eye exit
    ","Yemen’s Houthi rebels are not interested in spreading tyranny in the country and are willing to share power with other political factions if a permanent ceasefire with Saudi Arabia is reached, a top Houthi official has said. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, member of the Supreme Political Council and former head of Yemen’s Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said that other Yemeni factions have nothing to fear in case of a withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, promising an inclusive form of governance. “If we were not looking for full control during the war, then we will not look for full control at any other time,” al-Houthi told CNN. His attempts at reassurance will likely be viewed skeptically by the Houthis’ rivals, and come amid concerns from other stakeholders that a truce with Saudi Arabia will give the heavily-armed Iran-backed rebels free rein to take over the entire country. Yemen’s conflict began as a civil war in 2014, when Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government. It spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis. Eight years later, the coalition has been unable to dislodge the rebels, who have fired hundreds of rockets toward Saudi cities in retaliation. The war has sparked one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, leaving thousands dead and pushing parts of the country into famine. A Saudi delegation arrived in Sanaa on Sunday for talks with the Houthis aimed at securing a permanent ceasefire. And on Friday, negotiations bore their biggest fruits yet with the beginning of a three-day prisoner swap of nearly 900 detainees from both sides. Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam tweeted on Friday that talks had been “serious and positive.” Saudi Arabia has begun mending ties with old foes of late, namely Iran, Syria and now Yemen’s Houthis as it redirects its focus on economic growth at home, which requires regional stability. “Saudi Arabia currently needs stability on its southern border and to (eliminate) threats to it from Houthis and others,” said Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, adding that it will transform its role in Yemen from a military one to one of soft power. Al-Houthi told CNN the group is willing to share power and resources with the Yemeni people. “We do not want to tyrannize anything,” he said, adding that it is keen to speak to other Yemeni factions and work with them to achieve what is in their interests and “in the interest of the public.” Experts have argued that a Saudi deal with the Houthis that does not address the pre-existing political problems among Yemen’s disparate groups will only end the international dimension of the war and could escalate the civil conflict. Other factions, especially the internationally recognized government and the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) that controls parts of the south, may find al-Houthi’s promises difficult to believe, experts say, as all other stakeholders in the conflict – including the United Nations – have been excluded from the current Houthi-Saudi talks. CNN has reached out to the Saudi government for comment. “What (al-Houthi) means by Yemen’s interests is recognizing the Houthis as the only legitimate authority to rule the country,” Nadwa Al-Dawsari, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN. “What he means is that the Houthis have no intention of forcefully taking over Yemen if all other parties accept to be subordinates to the Houthis in any future arrangements.” The STC, she said, is heavily dependent on the UAE’s support and if that ends with the withdrawal of foreign forces, they don’t have a great chance to stand up to the Houthis, “who have much more sophisticated weapons, fighting experience, training, and (Iranian) commanders helping them.” The STC didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment but has said previously that it stands by its rejection of a Houthi-controlled Yemen. The group has demanded a split of the country into north and south. The Houthi leader told CNN he expected Saudi Arabia to ensure the departure of all foreign forces, including the UAE, from the country.”Our real demand is the exit of all foreign forces from the Republic of Yemen,” he said. “There is no complete resolution that can be reached unless all occupying forces leave the Yemeni republic, and this includes all islands and other areas.” The UAE is a member of the Saudi-led coalition but partially withdrew its troops from Yemen in 2019. Abu Dhabi nonetheless retains strong influence over Yemen’s south. Al-Dawsari said Abu Dhabi and Riyadh may not see eye to eye on the future of Yemen, but the UAE has repeatedly said that it supports Saudi Arabia’s efforts in the country. On Monday, a senior UAE official told CNN that the UAE “supports current efforts by Saudi Arabia to bring a political solution to the crisis, to bring peace and a permanent end to hostilities between all the various Yemen parties.” Mohamed Ali al-Houthi told CNN that talks with the Saudis haven’t included “political things,” insisting that Riyadh instead focus on meeting the group’s demands such as removing the blockade on ports, opening Yemen’s airspace and paying the salaries of public sector employees. Internal matters, including demands by the STC for the south of the country to secede, will be dealt with “in the future,” he said. The STC will be given “what is rightful (to them),” he said, but not more. He did not rule out a separation of the south but stressed that any solutions to the “southern issue” must be taken without foreign influence. Al-Houthi repeatedly stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia meeting the group’s “humanitarian demands,” referring to a compensation package that would have Riyadh pay for the rebuilding of the country and the salaries of public sector workers. The discussions remain secretive, and it is unclear how much compensation the Houthis have demanded, but experts expect it to be substantial. The Houthis have said in the past that it is seeking compensation for 1.3 million public employees and that the war has led to a cut in salaries and other expenses of nearly 95%, according to Houthi media. But some experts are concerned that the Houthis would use the money to pay its militia members. “Even if the Saudis agree to pay the salaries, we have no clear image of what that might look like,” Nagi said, adding that the internationally recognized government may also require payments. Even if a Saudi-Houthi deal is reached, there’s no guarantee that other Yemeni factions will accept it, experts say. “Based on what we see, it is clear that those who are negotiating are closer to winning,” Nagi said, “While those who are excluded from the talks are closer to losing.” ",1148,middleeast,2023-04-14,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/middleeast/yemen-saudi-houthi-interview-mime-intl/index.html

      Iranian commander sentenced to 13 years for shooting down Ukrainian passenger plane
    ","A court in Tehran convicted as many as 10 Iranian military personnel on Sunday for their involvement in the shooting down of Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 in 2020, according to Iran’s semi-official Mehr News. But the sentence was dismissed as a “sham ruling” by victims’ families who say Iranian authorities have failed to prosecute those ultimately responsible for the disaster. The main defendant in the trial was the unnamed commander of the Tor M1 surface-to-air missile defense system that shot down the plane, killing all 176 people on board. The commander was sentenced to 13 years in prison, according to Mehr. The Boeing 737 flight departed from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran on January 8, 2020, and was headed to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv when it was hit by anti-aircraft missiles shortly after takeoff. Days after the downing, Iranian authorities admitted that its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force shot the plane down by mistake after it was misidentified as a cruise missile by an air defense operator. In the Tehran court’s final verdict on Sunday, it said the passenger plane was shot down by “human error.” The commander fired missiles at the civilian aircraft twice, “contrary to the order of the command post and other instructions,” the court said, according to Mehr. The other defendants found guilty were personnel of the air defense post, Mehr reported. The Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims, an international group seeking justice for those killed, released a statement on Sunday saying the victims’ families “never recognized the Islamic Regime’s court as a legitimate tribunal.” It claimed the tribunal had failed to prosecute the “main perpetrators” of the incident, instead prosecuting “ten low-ranking officers with total obscurity of their backgrounds and identities.” The association condemned the trial as a “sham ruling,” after court sessions were held in private, with victims’ families not present for hearings. More than 70 complainants from the families of victims had withdrawn their complaints before the sentencing was handed down and rejected the competence of the court, it said. The group considers the case still open, and is demanding the dispute be considered by the International Court of Justice. The passenger jet downing happened at a time of heightened tensions with the United States, hours after Iran launched ballistic missile strikes on a US base in Iraq – an act of retaliation for the US drone killing of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani. At the time thousands of anti-government protesters in Tehran took to the streets to denounce the crash, with some calling for the removal of Iran’s supreme leader and for the prosecution of those responsible. Of those killed in the crash, 138 were traveling to Canada, according to the CBC. Among the victims were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three Britons.

      Iran executions up 75% as Tehran seeks to ‘instill fear’ in protesters, rights groups say
    ","Iran executed at least 582 people last year, a 75% increase on the previous year, according to human rights groups who say the rise reflects an effort by Tehran to “instill fear” among anti-regime protesters. It was the highest number of executions in the Islamic republic since 2015, according to a report released Thursday by the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) and the France-based Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) groups. The vast majority of the executions – at least 544 – were of people accused of murder and drug-related offenses, said the report. It added that almost 90% of the executions it recorded were not announced by Iranian authorities and some had been carried out in secret. The two rights groups said the increase was Tehran’s way of trying to frighten protesters and prevent dissent, following a nationwide uprising sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last September. “Iran’s authorities demonstrated how crucial the death penalty is to instill societal fear in order to hold onto power,” the report said. Iranian authorities have responded to the protests with brute force, mass arrests and hasty sham trials, drawing sharp global condemnation and sanctions from the United States. The report documented 15 executions carried out on the vaguely defined charges of “enmity against God” and “corruption on Earth.” Mohsen Shekari – reportedly the first person to be executed in connection with the protests – was hanged on December 8 after he was convicted of “waging war against God” for allegedly stabbing a member of the Basij paramilitary force, a wing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, at a protest in Tehran on September 23. Less than a week later, Majidreza Rahnavard was also convicted for reportedly killing two members of the same paramilitary force and injuring four others on November 17. Two other Iranian young men – Mohammad Mehdi Karami, a karate champion; and Seyed Mohammad Hosseini, a volunteer children’s coach – were hanged on January 7 this year in connection with the protests, according to Iran’s judiciary news agency Mizan. They were convicted of killing a member of the Basij paramilitary force in Karaj on November 3, Mizan reported. The human rights report said they were charged with “corruption on Earth.” Dozens of other protesters have received death sentences in recent months. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has openly praised the Basij for its role in the crackdown, describing the protesters as “rioters” and “thugs” backed by foreign forces. But United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief Volker Turk has criticized the crackdown as pushing Iran into a “full-fledged human rights crisis.” More than half of the executions last year took place after the protests erupted in September. Some 44% of all those sentenced to death were accused of drug-related offenses, despite no evidence of a marked rise in drug use or trafficking reported by international agencies, the report said. IHR Director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam suggested Iran would have executed even more people had it not been for “international reactions to the death sentences against protesters” which had “made it difficult for the Islamic republic to proceed” with the killings. “To compensate, and in order to spread fear among people, the authorities have intensified executions for non-political charges. These are the low-cost victims of the Islamic republic’s execution machine,” Amiry-Moghaddam said. “In order to stop this machine, the international community and civil society inside and outside Iran must show the same reaction to each and every execution,” he added. In the report, the two rights groups urged the international community “to increase efforts to support the demands of the Iranian people for respect of their fundamental human rights and the abolition of the death penalty.” ",615,middleeast,2023-04-14,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/middleeast/iran-execution-report-2022-intl-hnk/index.html

      ‘Beautiful lioness’ spotted in Chad’s Sena Oura National Park for first time in almost 20 years
    ","After a two-decade absence, at least one lion has returned to Chad’s Sena Oura National Park. An image of a “muscular female lion” in the park was captured by a remote camera in February, according to a news release from the Wildlife Conservation Society, which released the image on Thursday in collaboration with the government of Chad. Lions haven’t been spotted in the park for almost 20 years, says the news release. The conservationists who released the image described the big cat as “a beautiful lioness, in her prime and clearly in great health” in the release. Lions are considered extinct in Sena Oura, located near Chad’s border with Cameroon, by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The border region between Chad and Cameroon “saw a period of ruthless, organized poaching more than a decade ago, but has since benefited from a very strong commitment to conservation by the governments of both Cameroon and Chad,” the Wildlife Conservation Society said in the news release. “This has produced better protection of the national parks and wildlife populations are now starting to recover,” it added. Lions are categorized as “Vulnerable” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, with between 23,000 and 39,000 of the big cats left in the wild. Their populations are especially “small and fragmented” in west and central Africa, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Killing by humans, habitat loss, and the loss of their prey have all contributed to the population’s decline.

      Bodies exhumed in Kenya starvation cult probe
    ","Kenyan police have exhumed the bodies of 21 people thought to be followers of a Christian cult who believed they would go to heaven if they starved themselves to death. Police near the coastal town of Malindi started exhuming bodies on Friday and recovered seven bodies that day. They recovered 14 more bodies on Saturday, detective Charles Kamau told Reuters on Sunday. “This horrendous blight on our conscience must lead not only to the most severe punishment of the perpetrator(s) of the atrocity on so many innocent souls, but tighter regulation (including self-regulation) of every church, mosque, temple or synagogue going forward,” said Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki. He added that the entire 800 acre forest where the graves had been found had been sealed off and declared a scene of crime. Earlier this month, police rescued 15 members of the group – worshippers at the Good News International Church – who they said had been told to starve themselves to death. Four of them died before they reached hospital, police said. The leader of the church, Paul Mackenzie, was arrested following a tip-off that suggested the existence of shallow graves belonging to at least 31 of Mackenzie’s followers. Local media, citing police sources, reported that Mackenzie has refused to eat or drink while in police custody.

      First evacuations of foreign nationals stuck in Sudan announced
    ","Saudi Arabia has become the first country to announce evacuations of its stranded citizens from Sudan, a week after intense fighting broke out there between two rival forces. The Saudi foreign ministry said “several nationals of brotherly and friendly countries” were being evacuated along with the Saudi citizens. Kuwaiti citizens are among the dozens of people brought to safety but it is not clear which other nationals are involved. The announcement came after both the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said they were ready to help evacuate foreign nationals. The SAF said in a statement Saturday that its leader, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has “agreed to provide the necessary assistance” to facilitate the safe evacuation of foreign citizens from the country in response to “calls from a number of heads of states.” “The evacuation of all missions whose countries made such a request is expected to begin within the coming hours, as the United States, the UK, France, and China will evacuate their diplomats and nationals by air by military transport aircrafts belonging to their respective armed forces from Khartoum and this is expected to begin immediately,” the SAF said in the statement, posted on its Facebook page. According to a list released by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, 91 of its citizens had been evacuated, along with 66 nationals from 12 other countries which included Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Tunisia, Pakistan, India, Bulgaria, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Canada, and Burkina Faso. It did not provide an exact breakdown of how many evacuees came from each of the countries it listed. Kuwait thanked Saudi Arabia for evacuating its citizens from Sudan to Jeddah,  in a statement released by its foreign ministry on Saturday. But it did not specify how many Kuwaiti nationals had been evacuated. Iraq’s Foreign Affairs Ministry told CNN via phone that there had been a “special operation” to evacuate its diplomats from their embassy in the capital Khartoum. Ministry spokesperson Ahmad al-Sahaaf said the diplomats had been moved to “a safe place in Sudan” following the operation, but declined to give further details. The developments came as the United States evacuated government personnel in an operation involving special forces. The mission was led by US Africa Command and conducted in close coordination with the State Department, said Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense. Fierce fighting broke out in Sudan last Saturday between the SAF and the paramilitary RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. The two are former allies but tensions between them arose during negotiations to integrate the RSF into the country’s military as part of plans to restore civilian rule. More than 420 people have been killed and 3,700 injured in the fighting, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and on the ground the humanitarian situation is worsening. The UN says people are increasingly fleeing areas hit by fighting, including Khartoum. Up to 20,000 refugees have arrived in neighboring Chad, the UN says. On Saturday, fresh clashes between the two groups shattered a three-day ceasefire declared for the Muslim holiday of Eid. Fighting was reported in Khartoum on Saturday, with witnesses telling CNN fierce clashes were taking place in the vicinity of the presidential palace and the sounds of explosions and warplanes flying overhead could be heard. Dagalo said he spoke to French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna on Saturday and they discussed “the current situation, the reasons [that] led to the exacerbation of the situation” and the possibility of opening evacuation corridors. Also on Saturday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak chaired an emergency meeting to discuss the situation. CNN has learned that British evacuation efforts  will not be happening imminently, but a government spokesperson told CNN they were doing “everything possible” to support British nationals. A spokesperson for the European Union said that an estimated 1,500 citizens from various EU countries are currently in Sudan. “They are facing a very difficult situation and their safety is a priority. We urge both sides (the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces) to stop fighting and allow for safe passage out of the country,” the spokesperson said, adding the EU was working with member states to find solutions and get these people out of the country. It is unclear how many US citizens are in Sudan. The State Department does not keep official counts of US citizens in foreign countries and Americans are not required to register when they go abroad. US State Department officials told staffers estimated 16,000 American citizens in Sudan, most of whom are dual nationals. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

      ‘I’m tired. I’m just really, really tired.’ One woman describes living through Sudan’s crisis
    ","Two men are battling for control in Sudan, but stuck in the middle are the country’s people. Hundreds have died, tens of thousands have fled. Residents have been stranded at home and in shelters without food or water, and petrol has become an increasingly important commodity. Since the fighting began last Saturday, CNN has been regularly in touch with Iman Abu Garjah, a British-Sudanese doctor who became stuck while visiting family to celebrate Ramadan. We got this update from her on Friday. Her words have been edited for clarity. “I’m tired. I’m just really, really tired. Exhausted is the right word for it; burnt out. There’s just so much adrenaline. “We were happy about the 24-hour ceasefire [earlier in the week], which was extended, not because there actually was a ceasefire, but there was spacing out between the attacks. “[On Thursday] we all just felt really tired, we were still fasting in the midst of all of this, and everybody’s sentiment was Ramadan just has to come to an end. “I prepared supper, made some sunny side up eggs, trying to make something nice out of a can of tuna. I tried to moisten some stale bread. “Very late at night, we heard, I don’t know what they were, missiles maybe? “My dad has quite limited mobility because he’s sick. He’s been lying sleeping on this sofa bed. We just had to just push him from the living room where he has been sleeping to a safer area where there was a wall covering rather than just windows. “My cousin is also with us. My daughter was absolutely mortified and just inconsolable. My 96-year-old grandmother was in a room behind the place we were sheltering in. She could hear the shelling, she can feel the shaking, the sound coming into the house but I downplayed it for her. My mother was there as well. My sister. “We also have with us domestic helpers. There’s one from Kenya. She’s not Muslim so I started reading the Lord’s Prayer with her. I thought maybe it will bring her some solace and reassurance to know that she’s not alone. “We also have a couple of Ethiopian house helpers, and they were very scared. I kept thinking to myself, these poor people, they flee their countries to come to a place like Sudan, far from their families, to make money to send to them or to go to a safer place and this is what happens to them. It just seems so so unfair. “I think there were two or three very very loud thuds that were very close to the house. We just started reading [the] Quran, praying that we were going to be safe trying to calm the children. I wish I was an octopus so [I] have more hands, hands and arms to put around people just to hug them. “[Friday] has been a blur. I didn’t hear any of the Eid call to prayers, which is one of the things that usually fills me with a lot of joy. It’s one of the main reasons I came from the UK because I just wanted to have a nice fast with family and here it is. All the Eid clothes are in the bag. The nail polish, the hair stuff. I didn’t even put my mascara on. So it’s a really sad day. “A lot of people are fleeing. There are a lot of people offering places on buses to go to Egypt. Ours is a logistical nightmare. It’s a big family and each person or each group of people or household has different requirements. Moving [my grandmother] is not going to be like moving my eight-year-old nephew. “My brother’s daughter has certain health needs, she needs access to certain medications. My mother, my father, my grandmother and my sister, they also would all feel very poorly, or maybe not even survive if they don’t have their medications. “We try to be positive. We try to play games, we try to watch movies, but our attention span has just completely gone. No one can sit and watch a movie. “I focus on the good stuff: we have oil, we have electricity, we have running water because the water tank is working. We have cars in the driveway but no petrol for them. “I’m avoiding the news. Statements by both parties seem to have the same author: I am your saviour and victor. I know they are both untruthful, manipulative, blood thirsty men with no regard for the dignity nor lives of the people they are paid to serve and protect.

      Brazil’s Lula pitches ‘peace coalition’ for Ukraine, but he treads a thin line
    ","Calling for peace in Ukraine from thousands of miles away, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been trying to position himself as a possible mediating force in the conflict for months now. Without offering much detail on the plan, Lula, as he is known, seems to be fully embodying his government’s line that “Brazil is back” — that is, back to claim a role in global politics. He says he aims to form a coalition of countries willing to intervene and lead efforts for peace in Ukraine, though in the process is finding himself treading a thin line with the world’s biggest powers. Lula’s proposal is to create “a G20 for peace” – a group of countries strong enough to be respected at the negotiating table, but that are still considered by some as neutral in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Indonesia, India, and China would play a crucial role in his vision, but Latin American countries are also invited to join the apparent initiative. When he launched his political comeback in 2022, Lula told Time magazine that he thought both Russia and Ukraine were responsible for the conflict. Lula condemned Russia’s decision to invade its neighbor, but controversially claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could have done more to avoid the conflict. Once in office, he insisted that Brazil would not take a side. But when German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz recently encouraged Brazil to contribute weapons to Ukraine’s defense, Lula felt compelled to do something, explains Guilherme Casarões, political scientist and professor at Fundação Getúlio Vargas’ Public Administration School. “He was sitting on the fence, he was very comfortable where he was, and now he had to get off the fence,” Casarões said. Lula could not contemplate sending weapons – a step that would go far beyond Brazil’s traditional foreign policy, suggested the analyst. “No Brazilian administration, not even Bolsonaro’s, I’d say, would send weapons to Ukraine. Brazil doesn’t engage in wars we have nothing to do with, Brazil doesn’t participate unless it’s a world war of sorts,” Casarões said. But he couldn’t do nothing, either – after all, Lula had promised to bring Brazil “back” to the world stage. “He could have just said ‘no’, but he did not,” says Casarões. “Instead he said, ‘Ok I’m not sending weapons to Ukraine but let’s try to broker peace, let’s use Brazil’s reputation and my own skills as a mediator to allow for a peace summit to take place, let’s try to work it out. If I am to take sides, let me take the side of dialogue’.” The United States, France, and Germany have heard Lula’s pitch to create a team of peacemakers. Lula has also broached the idea with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but left Beijing earlier this month without any formal commitment. Lula has struggled to make his proposal widely persuasive. One controversial idea that he has floated for a possible resolution would see Ukraine cede Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 – a concession that Kyiv has ruled out and which the White House has described as “simply misguided.” Lula’s shoot-from-the-hip approach to consensus-building has also been rocky. Until recently, the US – a close ally to Kyiv – had largely kept quiet about Lula’s comments on Ukraine. But while still in Beijing last week, Lula took aim directly at Washington, who along with the EU have been major suppliers of defensive arms and aid to Ukraine. Lula told reporters the US should stop “encouraging” the war “and start talking about peace”  – a comment that drew praise from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and anger from Washington. Two days later, US National Security spokesman John Kirby accused Brazil of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda.” It is “deeply problematic how Brazil has substantively and rhetorically approached this issue by suggesting that the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war,” Kirby said. “Quite frankly, in this case, Brazil was parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda without at all looking at the facts.” Chastised, Lula later seemed to soften his tone; during a speech at the occasion of the visit of the president of Romania the very next day, the Brazilian leader emphasized that his government “condemns the violation of territorial integrity of Ukraine” and at the same time “defend[s] a negotiated political solution.” To do otherwise would risk isolating Brazil from its friends and trading partners in the West, experts told CNN. “If we are in this environment of saying we condemn Russia’s aggression and we will try to find solutions for peace together, then yes, of course we will value Brazil’s efforts,” said Ambassador of the European Union to Brazil, Ignacio Ybáñez, told CNN Brasil Tuesday. “Where we start having some difficulty understanding the ideas of the Brazilian government is precisely when they place the attacker and the attacked on the same level,” he said. Lula needs to hone his message and show his willingness to engage with Ukraine now if he hopes to maintain credibility in Europe and the US, and to ultimately claim any credit for peacemaking, says Casarões. “Lula hasn’t really thought about what kinds of things he was going to say, in this effort of building this unaligned position,” he said. “If Lula keeps on reaffirming that Russia and Ukraine are equally responsible for the war, I think that his capital is going to wane at some point, so it’s important for Lula to take a step back, maybe reconsider some of the things that he has said on the war, and maybe change the way he puts it, even if slightly. I think that will be enough for people to understand where Brazil really stands.” He suggests that Lula could invite a Ukrainian delegation to Brasilia, to match Lavrov’s visit last week. “Let’s show them that we are really willing, really committed to talking to both sides,” Casarões says. As of Friday, Lula had asked foreign policy adviser and former foreign minister Celso Amorim to travel to Ukraine, although no date has been set for the trip. Amorim also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month in Moscow. But Lula’s position will remain complicated as he attempts to protect Brazil’s economic interest while catapulting himself into a fraught geopolitical arena. China is Brazil’s biggest trading partner and a major buyer of Brazilian soy and beef. For both of these commodities, Brazilian farmers also depend on Russian fertilizers. The economic and diplomatic agendas could come crashing down, if he slips. Andre Pagliarini, assistant professor of history at Hampden-Sydney College and a non-resident fellow at the Washington Brazil Office and Quincy Institute, says China is ultimately part of the reason why a Lula-brokered peace deal is unlikely to take shape. “China, like Brazil, has an interest in getting Russia to end the war. Unlike Brazil, however, it has the ability to force Putin’s hand and unlike Brazil has no interest in sharing credit for peace,” Pagliarini said. As Lula continues his world tour of “Brazil is back”, he also faces a variety of challenges at home — from the firing of his chief of security over leaked video of the January 8 riots in Brasilia, to the growing political threat of Brazil’s radical right. His country’s economy is shrinking and inflation is rising; indigenous communities in the Amazon are in crisis; and food security haunts the nation. A strategy of maintaining Brazil’s tradition of nonalignment and charting an independent path from the great global powers could be good for both him and for Brazilians. The government’s view is that the sanctions imposed on Russia by the US, Japan, and EU countries have severely disrupted global commerce and agriculture, and this impact is outsized for developing countries whose economies are still reeling from a pandemic – Brazil included. There is a chance Brazil can look good brokering peace while still doing what is best for its own economic growth – but the stakes are high. “If it can deliver real material gains for Brazilians, I think it’ll be considered a success,” Pagliarini says. “If living standards don’t improve for Brazilians, however, Lula’s foreign policy will likely play into a narrative that he is too old and backward to lead Brazil into the next decade.” ",1384,americas,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/americas/brazil-lula-ukraine-peace-coalition-intl-latam/index.html

      Guantanamo Bay Naval Station Fast Facts
    ","Here’s a look at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station and its detention facilities. The base, sometimes referred to as “Gitmo,” is located in southeastern Cuba, on the coast of Guantánamo Bay. The United States has been leasing the 45 square miles that the base sits on since 1903. The base shares a 17-mile fenced border with Cuba. The lease can only be terminated by mutual agreement. In response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and subsequent military operations in Afghanistan, existing migrant detention facilities at Guantánamo were repurposed to hold detainees in the “war on terror.” During the administration of President George W. Bush (2001-2009), the United States claimed that Guantánamo Bay detainees were not on US soil and therefore not covered by the US Constitution, and that “enemy combatant” status meant they could be denied some legal protections. There are 30 detainees at Guantánamo Bay. More than 700 detainees have been held at Guantánamo since it opened. Peak population was 684 detainees in June 2003. According to Human Rights First, 500 detainees were transferred or released during the Bush Administration and 197 detainees were transferred or released during the Obama Administration. At least nine detainees have died in custody. The US Defense Department spent about $445 million to run Guantánamo Bay in 2015, down from $522.2 million in 2010. 1903 - The new Republic of Cuba leases 45 square miles of land in Guantánamo Bay to the United States for construction of a naval station.

      New CCTV footage fuels debate over January 8 riots in Brazil
    ","A man dressed in the yellow and green of the Brazilian flag walks towards a glass table inside the Planalto Presidential Palace in Brasilia with a metal rod in his hand. In one decisive swoop he swings it towards the table, shattering it to pieces. The moment — one of many supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro ransacked the seat of the Brazilian presidency on January 8 — was captured on new CCTV footage, exclusively obtained by CNN affiliate CNN Brasil. The footage provides new insight into one of the darkest days in in the life of Brazil’s young democracy. It also appears to bolster the claims of those who accused police of failing to act to stop protesters from breaking into the Presidential Palace, among other government buildings. Days after the incident, President Lula da Silva said he believed that some police had colluded with protesters, alleging political bias among security forces. “There were a lot of people colluding, it’s important to say, there were a lot of conniving people from the military police, there were a lot of conniving people from the armed forces,” he told journalists at the Presidential Palace on January 12. The newly obtained footage shows police forces seemingly retreating as supporters of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who was ousted in a vote last fall – march on the palace. Some police support vehicles drive away and groups of police with riot shields appear to disperse. Inside, security is seen locking the main glass door of the Palace, but then seemingly moving away as rioters enter the building. Once they, do the ransacking begins; protesters can be seen breaking antique clocks, smashing tables, phones and nearly everything else they can get their hands on. Former policeman and public security researcher Cassio Thyone says that some officers may have conducted themselves inappropriately, possibly believing that the protestors could not break in. “I don’t believe it was incompetence, maybe some negligence. It wasn’t all of them but some police officers ended up thinking there was no risk of an invasion,” Thyone said. The Institutional Security Office, known as GSI, which advises the president on security matters and handles law enforcement and security personnel tasked with safeguarding Presidential Palaces and their staff, said its officers were being investigated, but defended their conduct as an attempt to strategically concentrate demonstrators onto a single floor to arrest them. “The GSI states that the images show the performance of security officers, which was, at first, with the intent of evacuating the fourth and third floors of the Planalto Palace, concentrating the demonstrators on the second floor, where, after waiting for the reinforcement of the military police riot squad, it would be possible to arrest them,” the GSI said in a statement on Wednesday. “It must be known that the conduct of the GSI public officers involved is being investigated in an inquiry initiated within the scope of this Ministry and if irregular conduct is proven, the corresponding authors will be held responsible,” it also said. Conspiracy theorists on Brazil’s right have seized on the new footage. At the time of the riots, many in the opposition argued the incidents had actually helped cement Lula’s leadership and claimed, without evidence, that the government had set police up to fail for that exact reason. Bolsonaro’s party — the Brazilian Liberal Party — has used the footage to once again call for a parliamentary inquiry into the incident, tying the incidents to Lula and his government. “We need justice and transparency to identify the real culprits,” the party tweeted on Wednesday. Brazil’s Minister for Institutional Relations Alexandre Padilha has also said that the current government supports an inquiry. Speaking to journalists on Thursday in Brasilia, Padilha also said that the footage had created “a new political situation” that risked bolstering unfounded theories about the insurrection. “[This footage] has created a new political situation, which makes those that tried to sweep the terrorists acts of January 8 under the rug try to create an absurd conspiracy theory, a real bulldozing, the theory they try to build is that the victims of those terrorist acts had responsibility over the behaviour of the terrorists of January 8.” The minister in charge of the GSI, General Marcos Gonçalves Dias, resigned this week, after critics raised questions over new CCTV footage that showed him walking alongside some of the rioters just feet away from the Presidential office. Minutes later, the same camera captures military officers greeting rioters and handing out bottles of water. When asked about his particular role, Dias – a long-time ally and friend of President Lula – denied that he was colluding with the protesters. “To liken my behaviour to that Major distributing waters to protesters is absurd,” he told Brazilian broadcaster Globo. “I entered the Palace after the Palace had been broken into, and I was taking people out of the third and fourth floor, to the second floor, so that they could be arrested.” Leaving more questions than answers, the video has added fuel to both sides of a fiery division still plaguing Brazilian politics.

      Indian police arrest alleged Sikh separatist leader, ending vast manhunt
    ","Police in India say they have arrested alleged Sikh separatist leader Amritpal Singh, bringing to an end a massive months-long manhunt. The news was announced in a tweet on Punjab Police India’s official Twitter account. Singh was arrested in Moga, Punjab, in the northwest of India, but will be taken to a high-security jail in Assam in India’s far east, according to CNN’s Indian affiliate News 18. Singh is a leading ideologue within the Khalistan movement, an outlawed separatist campaign that seeks to establish a sovereign state for followers of India’s minority Sikh religion. Police have been searching for Singh since March 18, when he was accused of attempted murder, obstruction of law enforcement, and creating “disharmony” in society. The manhunt has revived calls for an independent Sikh homeland in India’s Punjab state, stoked fears of violence, and revived painful memories of a bloody insurgency that killed thousands. In March, while police searched for Singh, Indian authorities blocked internet access for about 27 million people in the state of Punjab, one of the country’s most extensive blackouts in recent years. The controversial self-styled preacher was relatively unknown until the death of actor and activist Deep Sidhu last year. Sidhu backed the country’s year-long farmer’s movement and founded Waris Punjab De – a group established to protect Sikh rights. Waris Punjab De mobilized farmers and activists – many of whom were Sikh – against Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s attempt to modernize the country’s agricultural sector. In a rare retreat, Modi repealed the laws in November 2021. But even after the revocation, Waris Punjab De continued its campaign to protect the Sikh religion and Punjab’s culture. Sidhu was killed in a car crash in February 2022 and Amritpal Singh took over the reins, leading marches and giving impassioned – often provocative – speeches, building a large following and gaining popularity. His comments about social issues and protecting religious rights of Sikhs against what he has described as Hindu nationalist elements led by Modi have struck a chord among many Sikhs in the state. Singh has likened himself to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a leading figure of the Khalistan movement who was killed by the Indian army in 1984 after they stormed Amritsar’s Golden Temple – Sikhism’s holiest shrine – in an operation ordered by former prime minister Indira Gandhi. That operation caused huge anger within the Sikh community and Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in the aftermath. Earlier this year Amritpal Singh invoked Bhindranwale’s rhetoric by saying home Minister Amit Shah could meet the same fate as Gandhi after Shah spoke against Khalistan. The Sikh religion was founded in the Punjab in the 15th Century by Guru Nanak and has about 25 million followers worldwide. Sikhs are a minority group in India, comprising of less than 2% of the country’s 1.3 billion people, but they form a majority in Punjab. The origins of the modern Khalistan movement trace back to around the time of India’s independence from Britain in 1947, when some Sikhs demanded that a nation be carved in the state of Punjab for followers of the faith.

      Critically ill elephant Noor Jehan dies at Pakistan zoo
    ","A 17-year-old critically ill elephant called Noor Jehan has died at Pakistan’s Karachi Zoo, with the animal welfare charity that had been treating her calling for the zoo’s closure. The elephant was suffering from preexisting serious ailments before falling in a pond last week, Four Paws said in a statement. The elephant’s health had deteriorated quickly in the past few weeks and she became unable to stand up. “She spent too long lying on the ground – a life-threatening situation for elephants,” the group said. “Despite all our tireless efforts and the endless work of the team on-site, we could not get her back on her feet. She fought for days but succumbed to her critical condition,” it added. Animal groups say elephants in captivity are usually dead by the time they reach 40, a significantly lower life expectancy than those living in the wild. Four Paws called for the transfer of the zoo’s other elephant, Madhubala, to a “more species-appropriate location as soon as possible, to prevent another potential tragedy.” “We hope the authorities in Pakistan will take Noor Jehan’s sad fate as an example and do better for captive wild animals in the country in the future. Noor Jehan represents so many more wild animals that suffer in captivity, in Pakistan and worldwide,” the group said. “We welcome that the Federal and Sindh government are considering shutting down Karachi Zoo permanently. This could be a turning point for the welfare of wild animals in captivity in Pakistan,” the statement continued. Reuters reported that the director of Karachi Zoo Khalid Hashmi was removed from is role on April 8 over complaints of negligence. His successor, Kanwar Ayub, said he was unsure if the complaints were true in the week following the Four Paw’s visit. “However, there has been no negligence in the three days I have been appointed, guaranteed,” he said on Friday, noting possible negligence over time. Noor Jehan was brought to Pakistan from Tanzania more than a decade ago, Reuters said. ",334,asia,2023-04-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/asia/pakistan-karachi-zoo-elephant-death-intl/index.html

      Japan prepared to shoot down North Korean spy satellite rocket if necessary, minister says
    ","Japan says it is prepared to shoot down a North Korean spy satellite rocket if it needs to. Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada told the Japanese military on Saturday to make the “necessary preparations,” as he could potentially “order the destruction of ballistic missiles.” The news follows an announcement by North Korea on Wednesday that Pyongyang is making its final preparations to launch its first military reconnaissance satellite. In a statement released by the Ministry of Defense, Hamada did not rule out shooting down the rocket used to launch the satellite. The Japanese Self Defense Forces have been put on alert for any debris from the rocket falling into Japanese territory. The Japanese military will deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor missiles and Aegis-equipped destroyer warships carrying sea-based Standard Missile-3 interceptor projectiles, the statement added. North Korean state media KCNA reported on Wednesday that its leader Kim Jong Un had ordered officials to prepare to launch the country’s first military reconnaissance satellite. Kim made the remarks alongside his daughter, believed to be called Ju Ae, who has increasingly accompanied her father on public outings, during a visit to the National Aerospace Development Administration earlier this week. North Korea claimed as early as last December that it had conducted an “important final stage test” for the development of a spy satellite. It has previously said the satellite could be ready by as soon as April this year. ",235,asia,2023-04-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/asia/japan-north-korea-spy-satellite-hnk-intl/index.html

      Australia eases pathway to citizenship for New Zealanders
    ","Australia announced on Saturday a direct pathway to citizenship for New Zealanders living in the country, reversing controversial visa rules a day before a visit by New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins. Hipkins, set to visit Queensland state’s capital Brisbane on Sunday, hailed the move as “the biggest improvement in the rights of New Zealanders living in Australia in a generation”. The changes, effective from July, meant New Zealand citizens living in Australia for four years or more could apply for citizenship without having to become permanent residents first, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement. “We know that many New Zealanders are here on a Special Category Visa while raising families, working and building their lives in Australia. So I am proud to offer the benefits that citizenship provides,” Albanese added. New Zealand has long campaigned for changes since visa rules were altered in 2001, making it tougher for Kiwis in Australia to get citizenship. The reform would bring New Zealanders’ rights more into line with those of Australian expats living in New Zealand, Australia’s Labor government said. “Kiwis taking up Australian citizenship will still retain their New Zealand citizenship. These dual citizens are not lost to New Zealand – but draw us closer together,” Hipkins said in a statement. The changes also meant children born in Australia since July to an Australia-based New Zealand parent would be automatically entitled to Australian citizenship, he said. “This will make critical services available to them,” he said, adding the changes delivered on an Albanese promise that no New Zealander be left “permanently temporary” in Australia. Around 670,000 New Zealand citizens live in Australia, while there are around 70,000 Australians in New Zealand, according to Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Australia’s Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil ruled out the changes being extended to other migrant groups, saying it was a “special arrangement with New Zealand”. The reform was about ensuring the “strong friendship we have is reflected properly in law”, she told ABC television.

      Ima Keithel: The world’s largest women-run market
    ","At first glance, Ima Keithel is much like any other market. Lines of vendors are here from dusk until dawn, eagerly flogging everything from fresh fruit to fish and fabrics. But after walking through its huge network of more than 5,000 stalls spread across three multi-story buildings and a sea of surrounding tin shacks, one unique aspect becomes hard to ignore: every single trader, without exception, is a woman. “We are just like family, we’re sisters,” says Meilani Chingangbam, a 65-year-old who has been selling religious ritual products like incense and shrine decorations at the market since 2002. “It’s a beautiful place to work. Everyone is trusting and kind.” Ima Keithel – meaning “mother’s market” in the local Meitei language – in Imphal, the capital of India’s northeastern state of Manipur, is said to be the largest women-only market in the world. Men can enter the space – but only to buy goods, to work as porters or guards or to provide the women with cups of milky chai. During the early morning rush, the scent of eromba, a local dish of mashed potato, bamboo shoots and dried fish chutney, sizzles through the air. In one corner, a group of matriarchs are huddled around discussing problems with delayed deliveries and subpar produce. All the while, women stop by to leave offerings at the shrine of Ima Imoinu, the goddess of wealth and business and the market’s main protector. The crowded aisles are stacked high with all manner of delightful treasures: fragrant pinewood and jade-colored betel nut leaves, handcrafted pottery and bamboo baskets, fine silken blankets and rugs in technicolor hues. Filling the spaces in between them are rows of traders wearing vibrant pink, yellow, red and green shawls, some with Manipuri chandon marks on their foreheads, others wrapped in Muslim head scarves. “You can get absolutely anything you could dream of here,” says Lina Moirangthem, a local Meitei tour guide. “The market is cheap and right in the heart of the city. The entire state’s economy practically runs thanks to these women.” Per custom, only women who are married can officially trade in the market, and to gain a space in the official area, a woman must be nominated by a retiring vendor, who will usually choose a successor she is related to like a sister, daughter or cousin. Priya Kharaibam, for example, is the third generation of her family’s pottery traders at Ima Keithel, following on from her grandmother. “I am proud to run the family business,” says the 34-year-old, flanked by a wall of terracotta pots. The creation of Ima Keithel dates back to the 16th century Kangleipak Kingdom, when it began as a makeshift, open-air market for bartering crops. To bolster the war efforts against the neighboring Burmese and Chinese, in 1533 conscription was made mandatory in Manipur and all men were trained as warriors from a young age to protect the kingdom’s perimeters, which run along the border with Myanmar. It was left, then, for the women to run the city. “The market was run by women of the state in open air,” says Lokendra Arambam, a former scholar of the region’s precolonial period at Manipur University. “It began as an all-female activity of selling fish, vegetables and other economic products.” Thanks to Imphal’s easily-accessible, strategic position at the center of Manipur, the city gradually grew to become the economic hub of the region, and the women of Ima Keithel became more and more influential. But beyond the day-to-day business trading and exchange, the hardy matriarchs of Ima Keithel have also played a crucial role in social and political activism in Manipur throughout the 500-year-old history of the market right up to this day. In 1891, for example, the women’s protests forced a backtrack on reforms introduced by the British colonizers that favored external trade over them. In 1939, angered at the British policy of exporting local rice to other parts of India, they confronted the army in what was the Anishuba Nupilan, or Second Women’s War – and won. More recently, when the state government announced plans to build a shopping mall on the market’s site in 2003, they organized weeks-long mass strikes, bringing the economy to a standstill and forcing a reversal. Even now, the women hold regular protests to exert influence, and their input has a serious sway on local elections. “There’s a huge strength of women working here,” says Thoudam Ongbi Shanti, president of one of the market’s vendors’ groups. “But we are not extraordinary people, we just want to make ends meet. We want to be responsible mothers.” These days Ima Keithel is a microcosm of Manipur’s egalitarian society. The state has one of the highest female literacy rates in India and it is seen as a pioneer for gender equality across the country. And while the vast majority of Manipur’s population is the local Meitei ethnic group, true to its progressive values the market also houses Hindi women as well as those representing the state’s 33 indigenous groups. Tungdar Makunga, a 50-year-old vendor from the Maring tribe who occupies a spot in a part of the less formal tin-roofed outer area, is among them. “Even though I only started here recently and I’m not officially registered, the other women are very cooperative and friendly,” she says. “They make space for me if I need it.” Others have used the freedom of the market to break out of traditional social norms. The 80-year-old fabric seller Nongmai Them Khumsonbi says that when she was a newlywed her husband, at the time a low-paid government clerk, opposed her wish to become a trader at the market because he did not believe a woman should work. “He didn’t want me to go out,” she grins. “But I won the argument. And I eventually started earning more than him.” Not everything has been a smooth transaction for these women, however. In January 2016, a magnitude-6.7 earthquake sustained serious damage to the market buildings, and it took almost two years to rebuild. Closures that lasted more than a year during the pandemic also took a toll on the livelihoods of the traders. But now business is back in full flow at this pioneering yet centuries-old market of mothers in remote northeastern India, every day a mesmeric mix of vibrant colors, sounds and smells – and the positive effects for the women are priceless. “I love my work from the heart, I do it passionately,” says Oinam Ongbi Jayela, a 64-year-old tailor and widow. “But it’s not just work. I’m relaxed here. It makes me happy to be with these women. Being here, I feel that I will live for a long time.” ",1116,,travel-article-imphal-india-mothers-market-intl-hnk,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/imphal-india-mothers-market-intl-hnk/index.html

      Disney cancels some fire effects at shows worldwide after dragon incident at Disneyland
    ","Disney will pull certain fire effects from shows at their resorts worldwide after an animatronic dragon caught fire at Disneyland in Southern California on Saturday, company officials say. “We are temporarily suspending fire effects similar to those used at Disneyland park’s Fantasmic at select shows and entertainment experiences globally out of an abundance of caution,” Disneyland officials said in a statement on Monday. Pyrotechnics are among the special effects featured in the long-running “Fantasmic” show at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World in Florida, according to the parks’ websites. Fantasmic is an outdoor show in which Mickey Mouse imagines battling classic Disney villains and features water effects, lasers and projections before the climatic pyrotechnics at the end. The dragon prop in the nighttime Fantasmic show at Disney World’s Hollywood Studios park uses a system that operates differently from the one used at Disneyland, so that show in Florida will continue as usual, Disney officials say. As of Monday afternoon, according to Disney World’s website, a Fantasmic show is scheduled for 9 p.m. ET Monday. The show typically runs nightly. The site lists a closure set for May 1 and May 2 for “routine maintenance.” At Disney World’s Magic Kingdom park, the daytime Festival of Fantasy parade also features a fire-breathing dragon. Disney officials say the parade will continue with the dragon float, but its fire effect has been temporarily suspended. As for the almost 30-minute Fantasmic show at Disneyland, Disney officials told CNN that “we do not have a status update to provide yet.” They suggested people check their entertainment schedule or Disneyland app. As of late Monday afternoon, Fantasmic shows were scheduled for regular weekend times, including this Friday-Sunday (April 28-30). Maleficent, the show-stopping, 45-foot fire-breathing dragon, caught fire on Saturday. That prompted evacuations of the Tom Sawyer Island section of the park, the company said in a statement. Because of smoke and wind, attractions near the island were also evacuated. No injuries were reported, and the cause of Saturday’s fire remains under investigation. This is not the first time a Disney dragon has caught fire. Back in 2018, the dragon float in the Festival of Fantasy parade at Disney World also went ablaze. No injuries were reported in that incident, either. ",373,,travel-article-disney-cancels-some-fire-effects,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/disney-cancels-some-fire-effects/index.html

      Here’s how you can buy IHG points with a 80% bonus in 2023 — and when it makes sense
    ","Although there are many opportunities to earn travel rewards — especially from travel credit cards — there’s an out-of-the-box way to quickly boost your account balances. Purchasing points directly from your travel provider of choice may actually work in your favor to give you outsized value. Many loyalty programs promote the opportunity to purchase points, but it’s hard to know if it actually makes sense or if it’s another marketing gimmick. However, when it comes to the IHG One Rewards program, it actually can make sense to purchase points quite often — especially when there’s a promotion being offered. Currently, IHG is offering members an 80% bonus when purchasing at least 5,000 IHG One Rewards points. This means if you were to purchase 15,000 points, for example, you’d end up with 27,000 points. IHG points typically cost between 1.35 cents to 1 cent apiece — the more you buy, the lower the cost. However, with this bonus opportunity, the purchase price ultimately goes down to 0.6 cents apiece when purchasing in bulk. Since this is nearly on par with the 0.5-cent valuation given to IHG points by frequent flyer website The Points Guy, you may find that purchasing IHG points at this discounted rate is a great deal. But you’ll want to act fast — the bonus is only available through June 7, 2023. You can purchase IHG One Reward points here. Just remember, IHG no longer has a fixed award chart, so the number of points required goes up or down depending on the time of year you’re looking to stay and the cash rate at the hotel. Additionally, keep in mind that if you have one of the IHG-branded credit cards, you’ll receive your fourth night free when redeeming points. Of course, we don’t recommend purchasing points blindly without a redemption in mind, and you’ll want to do the math to see if purchasing points actually makes sense for your vacation desires. We’ve done some of the leg work for you and found a handful of properties where purchasing points to redeem for a free stay can be incredibly valuable. Just 1 mile from Disney World, the Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites – Waterpark is the perfect solution for a large family. For the same price using points, you can select a two-bedroom suite that features a king bed, a bunk bed and even a pull-out couch. For those taking a break from Disney for the day, the resort offers 24 acres to explore, including a lagoon pool and water park, kids’ splash pad, nine-hole mini golf course, basketball courts, playground and an arcade. And for those visiting Disney, there’s a complimentary shuttle service to take you and your family to and from the park. We checked the rates during President’s Day weekend and found the two-bedroom suite to cost $239 plus taxes and fees. Or, for those redeeming points, you’re looking at approximately 26,000 points per night. With the 80% bonus offer, the 26,000 points per night will ultimately cost you $172.50 — a decent cost saving compared to the hotel’s cash rate. Situated right in the Berkshires, the Oak N Spruce Resort is an ideal destination to explore and relax during all four seasons, with many sites to see. You’ll be incredibly close to Great Barrington, Tanglewood, Mount Greylock, the Norman Rockwell Museum, ski resorts and much more. Back on the resort, there’s an indoor and outdoor pool, 18-hole mini golf course, movie theater, arcade and nature trails to explore. But best of all, when using points, you’ll be booked into a two-bedroom suite — a slightly more expensive room type than the standard room, but requiring the same number of points. Regardless of the time of year, this property costs 35,000 points per night. While this might not be a great redemption during the off-season, if you’re looking to stay during the summer or fall months, rates can easily cost at least $275 plus taxes and fees per night, making purchasing points a great deal. With the current 80% bonus promotion, it’ll only cost you $230 to purchase enough points for a one-night stay. With nearly $50 in savings per night, you don’t have to break the bank to explore the outdoors on your next vacation. Looking to stay right in the heart of Manhattan? If so, the Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan is perfectly situated on Broadway between 48th and 49th Street — an ideal location for exploring. Here, you’re just a stone’s throw away from Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. And if you want to explore the rest of the city, there’s a subway stop just one block away. Hotel rooms in Manhattan can be tight, but at this property, you can easily reserve a room with two beds for four guests for the same number of points. Over Labor Day weekend, we found rooms for around $400 plus taxes and fees a night, knowing the rooms with two beds cost more than a single bed. Or, you can redeem 56,000 points per night. With the current 80% bonus promotion when purchasing points, it’ll cost you just $320 a night. The Kimpton Seafire Resort + Spa is one of IHG’s most luxurious properties in the Caribbean. Located right on Seven Mile Beach, this property offers a true boutique resort setting with an on-site spa, fitness center, plunge pool, three on-site restaurants, complimentary bikes and a kids’ camp. If you’re looking for a blissful getaway — with or without kids — this is the perfect destination. Regardless of the time of year, this property typically costs a fixed 70,000 points per night. While the cash price ranges depending on the season, during Christmas week, you’ll be looking at more than $2,000 per night for a standard room. But fortunately, you can often still snag a room with points, and the cost to purchase the 70,000 points per night is just $390 with the current 80% bonus promotion. Of course, this is still a relatively high cash price, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find this particular property costing less than the cost to purchase points 365 days a year. So regardless of when you’re looking to visit this gorgeous IHG property, purchasing points will most likely always be your best bet. If you’re planning a trip Down Under, the Whitsunday Islands are a top destination for visitors, especially those who want to experience the Great Barrier Reef. The breathtaking InterContinental Hayman Island Resort will allow you to explore many beautiful beaches, embark on scuba diving trips and embrace the natural beauty around you. But this remote resort typically costs a pretty penny when paying in cash. Fortunately, though, purchasing IHG points will save you a nice chunk of change and allow you to put those savings toward experiences while you’re there instead. On a set of dates next March, we found the resort to cost $715 per night or 74,000 points. Despite a decent amount of points required, purchasing those points will only cost you $420 with the current 80% bonus offer. You’ll find that purchasing IHG points can, in many cases, save you money — especially with the current 80% bonus offer. But, you’ll want to actually take out the calculator and make sure it makes sense for your particular vacation. It’s also worth noting that this isn’t the highest bonus offer we typically see. IHG often runs a promotion wherein you can get a 100% bonus when purchasing points. So if you aren’t sure if you’ll be traveling to an IHG property in the near future, there’s a decent chance that another opportunity will pop up within the next few months. Before you go ahead and purchase those points, there are some things to keep in mind. First off, each member can only purchase a maximum of 250,000 points during the promotional period. This means if you go all-in with the current 80% bonus offer, you’ll end up with 450,000 points. With that being said, if both you and your partner have an IHG account, you can always purchase points on both accounts to get around the cap. But keep in mind that IHG charges a fee if you want to transfer points between accounts — a feature that we don’t necessarily recommend. You’ll also notice that many properties charge a resort fee or destination fee, and many times these fees can be quite costly. Unfortunately, even when using points, you’re still on the hook for paying these pesky fees at IHG properties. And lastly, while purchasing points can be a great option for some, you can always earn points — at no cost — with the welcome offer from an IHG-branded credit card. As previously mentioned, one of the best benefits of both of these credit cards is that you’ll receive your fourth night free when redeeming points. In other words, the least expensive night out of every four nights of your stay will be zeroed out. So before you book your next IHG stay, figure out if purchasing points makes sense for you. You can purchase IHG points here. Looking for a new travel credit card? Check out CNN Underscored’s list of the best credit cards currently available.

      Why you should always travel with compression socks, according to experts
    ","They might not be the most exciting item to add to your packing list, but a good pair of compression socks is a must-have for anyone who finds themselves boarding flights on a regular basis. Compression socks come with a number of benefits for frequent flyers that range from serious medical prevention to cosmetic and comfort factors. While doctors and orthopedic specialists agree that they aren’t absolutely vital for people with no prior medical conditions, compression socks are still considered to be a valuable travel tool for anyone hoping to make long flights a more comfortable experience. We spoke with a handful of professionals to get their insights on the benefits of wearing compression socks while flying as well as some of the better compression socks on the market to look for based on your particular needs. One of the most well-known perks of compression socks is how they can help to prevent blood clots, a worry for many when traveling by air. They work to stimulate circulation in the lower half, which is especially useful during long flights when you’re sitting for prolonged periods. “Compression stockings and socks can promote comfort while traveling and be one of the easiest ways to avoid blood clots associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT),” explains Dr. Bob Bacheler, managing director and flight nurse at Flying Angels. “Compression stockings/socks are elastic and as such help to prevent blood from pooling in the lower extremities, and prevent clots from forming.” After a long flight, it’s common for your legs to take some time to get used to activity. Along with promoting circulation in your legs, compression socks also work to help fight the feeling of fatigue in your legs. “To help with leg fatigue, it is a good idea to start with nonmedical compression socks, which you can buy online,” says Kyle Kroeger, founder of ViaTravelers. “Nonmedical support socks encourage circulation and can be worn on the plane and off. A key benefit is that you can stay more active on your feet as a tourist when you arrive at your destination.” Sitting for prolonged periods is common on flights, which, due to gravity, causes fluid retention in your legs below the knee. According to Derek Roach, owner of Flow Feet Orthopedics, this is also known as gravitational edema (colloquially referred to as swelling) and can easily be prevented with the right compression socks. “The elevation during flight does not have an effect on the swelling; however, it is the position of your body and gravity forcing fluids down to your lower half,” says Roach. Being able to stand up and walk around or stretching is limited on a plane; therefore, promoting blood circulation is necessary. “Compression socks help to increase circulation, thus preventing swelling in your lower legs and feet,” he explains. Some surgeons and doctors believe that wearing compression socks on a regular basis — and especially if you travel frequently — will help to prevent the backup of blood flow that can cause the appearance of varicose veins in the legs. The benefits of wearing compression socks while flying tend to outweigh whatever inconvenience or slight discomfort that the stockings can sometimes cause. With all of the benefits that come with wearing compression socks on flights, you may want to purchase a pair for yourself. But, as with most things we can buy, some are better than others. “As a flight nurse myself, I am frequently on extended flights of 12 hours to 24 hours, and I always wear compression socks,” says Dr. Bacheler. “The most important thing to look for is a compression sock that fits well. If a sock is too tight and uncomfortable, it is probably too small. “Compression socks should be high quality; comfortable to wear; do not bunch up, which can cause blood flow restriction; or slide down, which indicates that they are too loose.” You’ll want to be sure to read the fine print when shopping for the right compression socks for your specific needs. The primary difference between compression stockings, anti-embolism stockings and nonmedical compression socks is how high they come up. Nonmedical compression socks usually come up below the knee, while compression stockings traditionally come up to mid-thigh. Both typically provide the same compression, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A good compression sock will provide 15 to 25 mmHg, and good compression stockings and socks both promote blood return but do not interfere with blood flow to the extremity. Here are some expert-recommended compression socks you should consider before you head off on your next long-haul flight. Looking for a new travel credit card?

      Why this surreal ‘dripping’ watch has become a cult celebrity favorite
    ","Prized by collectors and sought after by stars from Jay-Z to Kim Kardashian West, the Cartier Crash has become one of the luxury market’s most unlikely hot-ticket watches. Straight out of the swinging ’60s, its dripping shape looks more like one of Salvador Dalí’s Surrealist melting clocks than a celebrity timepiece. The Crash also has an origin story — albeit an apocryphal one — that’s as unusual as its warped, asymmetric case. The legend begins in 1967 London, when a customer arrived at Cartier’s New Bond Street boutique to repair a watch damaged in a car accident. The fiery heat of the crash had, or so the story goes, melted its once-oval case. Jean-Jacques Cartier, the great-grandson of founder Louis-François Cartier, was “so seduced by the shape that (he) decided to reproduce it,” the company claims in marketing materials shared with CNN. Few are convinced by this tale — not least Jean-Jacques’s granddaughter Francesca Cartier Brickell, whose account is more straightforward. In her 2019 book “The Cartiers,” she wrote that her grandfather and designer Rupert Emmerson adjusted the already-popular Cartier Maxi Oval model for loyal clients demanding unique, custom-designed watches. They realized a metal case could be made to look “as though it had been in a crash” by “pinching the ends at a point and putting a kink in the middle,” she added. Regardless of how Crash was born, the myth has only added to its cultural cache, according to Benjamin Clymer, founder of the luxury watch site Hodinkee. “I think the story that has been perpetuated is just so compelling, so wonderful and romantic and crazy,” he said in a video call. “And then the name, the Cartier Crash with the double consonants — it just rings.” Only a dozen or so watches are thought to have emerged from this first production run. The Crash’s irregular shape made it laborious to make — and Cartier’s signature Roman numerals and sword shaped hands proved difficult to read. “That first Crash watch caused a lot of headaches,” Brickell quotes her grandfather as saying. “You see, it’s all very well coming up with a good-looking design, but it had to tell the time too! And because the dial was irregular, the numbers weren’t at the standard places.” The watch was far from an instant hit. One the era’s biggest movie stars, Stewart Granger, was among the first customers, though he returned his within a week because it was “too unusual,” according to Brickell. “I don’t think the design did resonate especially back then,” the author said over email, adding that it was “almost too radical for Cartier’s clientele” at the time. It was nonetheless an important development for the company’s London outpost, which at that time only stocked Cartier watches from France and Switzerland. Jean-Jacques “really did want to push things forward,” Clymer said, adding the Crash helped establish the British branch’s reputation for design. “From a geometric perspective, it was just so different than everything else out there.” The very first Crash is thought to have sold for around $1,000 (about $9,000 in today’s money). But the model has soared in value on the resale market in recent years. In 2021, one dating to 1970 fetched over 806,000 Swiss Francs ($908,000) at Sotheby’s in Geneva, setting a record for the model. Less than a year later, an exceptionally rare 1967 original smashed the record again when it sold for over $1.65 million via the online watch auction site Loupe. These astronomical prices can be attributed, in part, to the model’s scarcity on the collectors’ market, according to Tom Heap, a watch specialist at Sotheby’s London. Although Cartier does not publicize the total number made, experts believe it is in the hundreds, rather than the thousands. They exist in “immeasurably small quantities,” Heap added on a video call. After the initial batch, Cartier continued to produce Crashes on demand. It went on to produce new versions in white gold, pink gold and platinum (most notably in a limited edition run in 1991, though these are credited to Cartier Paris and usually sell for less than older London models). In 2018, Cartier then made two new limited-edition Crashes available via its New Bond Street store in 2018 — one with an 18-carat yellow gold case and the other made from white gold and encrusted with diamonds. They were moderately priced at 27,000 euros ($30,000) and 65,000 euros ($72,000), respectively, though Heap said they were mostly reserved for Cartier’s “top-tier clients.” Rarity alone cannot explain the sudden surge in prices, however. Heap recalls speaking to dealers who, less than 10 years ago, turned down opportunities to buy Crashes for around £60,000 (now around $65,000), even though they would now sell for many times that. Clymer meanwhile said that while he saw revived interest in collector circles in 2016 or 2017, the Crash was “not super sought-after” even five years ago. The turning point, he said, came in 2018 when Kanye West was seen wearing one on David Letterman’s Netflix special. “I’ll give credit where credit’s due,” Clymer said. “I think it was Kanye West wearing a crash that really put it back on the map.” Subsequent celebrity endorsements have helped send prices skywards. Tyler the Creator, for example, sported a Crash in his 2021 “Lumberjack” video, before being spotted wearing one at a Cartier watch auction in Monaco later that year. “Schitt’s Creek” star Dan Levy meanwhile wore one to the Met Gala. Heap welcomed the development as an antidote to the “big, ostentatious diamond-set pieces” normally seen on celebrity wrists. “It’s almost like a dress watch style, with a leather strap and a small-sized case,” he added. “I think that’s very cool.” The Crash’s appeal among collectors may speak to wider aesthetic trends. It is perhaps no coincidence that its revived fortunes coincide with renewed interest in the Surrealist movement, which is the subject of recent (and forthcoming) exhibitions at institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Modern and London’s Design Museum. How much, if at all, Jean-Jacques Cartier and Emmerson were influenced by Dalí’s 1931 painting “The Persistence of Memory” — the iconic image of clocks appearing to melt in a sparse landscape — may be lost to history. Regardless, Clymer believes the connection between horology and culture at large reflects luxury watches’ growing role in mainstream consciousness. “All important wristwatches are receiving so much more attention now than even three years ago, pre-Covid” he said, adding: “So, when there is something going on (in broader culture), like a revived interest in Surrealism, it’s much easier for people to make the connection between that and a Cartier Crash.” For Heap, the Crash’s appeal among collectors may also be due to its “imperfect and very organic” shape — one that would be near-impossible to mass produce. “It looks almost like it’s liquid or fluid. When you pick one up, it feels like it’s going to move or wobble,” he added: “As opposed to a lot of pieces nowadays… you can tell it was made by a person. There’s a human element to it.” Top image caption: A 1991 Cartier Crash that sold at auction in 2022.

      An ancient Roman bust purchased for $34.99 at Texas Goodwill is headed back to Germany
    ","From its time in Germany during World War II to the shelves of a Texas Goodwill, a 2,000-year-old Roman bust is making its way back home. In 2018, Laura Young purchased the bust for just $34.99 at an Austin-area Goodwill, unaware of its ancient history. “I was just looking for anything that looked interesting,” Young told CNN last May. The bust was lent out from Munich’s Glyptothek to the San Antonio Museum of Art for the past year and next month it will be returned to Germany. “It’s been really bittersweet,” Young told CNN on Thursday. “I’m a little in denial, but I do plan on visiting him in Germany.” When researching where the bust came from last year, Young was put in contact with Sotheby’s, which confirmed that the bust was estimated to be about 2,000 years old. The identity of the bust is not certain yet, but the team at SAMA told CNN they believe it resembles the Roman military leader Sextus Pompey. “I, along with some other scholars who worked from photographs of the German example after its disappearance, have suggested Sextus Pompey, based on similarities to portraits of his father, Pompey the Great, and to the coin that was included on the label in SAMA’s exhibition of the portrait, which has a portrait of Sextus on it.” Lynley McAlpine, a postdoctoral curatorial fellow at SAMA, said. The bust was originally housed in a replica of a Pompeii home, also known as Pompejanum, and was moved to storage just before the building was destroyed during the war. It is then believed that around the 1950s a US soldier stole the bust and brought it to the US, which is how it eventually ended up at the thrift store and in the hands of Young. For the past year, the 52-pound marble bust has been seen by thousands of guests at SAMA, including the Archduke Carl Christian of Austria and San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg. May 21 will be the artifact’s last day at the museum, when it will then be shipped back to Germany. SAMA says the bust will join two other Roman sculptures from the museum and will travel back to Germany to be together again for the first time in years. A representative from Glyptothek will oversee the packing process of the artifacts and personally shepherd them back to their home.

      Millions face a late-season spring chill, others brace for flooding and another round of severe weather
    ","If you follow seasons by the meteorological calendar, we are halfway through spring, but if you look at the forecast this week, it seems like anything but. A huge spring chill will impact a large chunk of the country this week, dropping temperatures well below normal and even bringing the potential for a handful of record lows. “After 4 consecutive days with temperature departures of +20 to +30F mid-month, the stagnant cool pattern of late should mean April ends below normal for most,” the National Weather Service office in the Twin Cities said, speaking about the Upper Midwest. Monday morning, Indianapolis tied a record low temperature after a morning start of just 28 degrees. Just four days ago, Indianapolis nearly tied a record high temperature, missing it by only 1 degree. Many cities are bracing for a similar swing in temperature extremes in the coming days. The cold will spread south and east this week, where millions could see temperatures well below normal from the Upper Midwest to the South. Temperatures will be running 10 to 20 degrees below normal, potentially breaking a few low temperature records the first half of the week. The cold will spill pretty far south, affecting places from Texas to the East Coast. Asheville, North Carolina, could break a record low Tuesday morning if they get below freezing. The Tri-Cities area of Tennessee could also break a record low Tuesday morning. Temperatures will dip well below freezing across the Ohio Valley, which could kill crops and other vegetation. “It appears Wednesday night has the best shot for rather cold temperatures to occur. Lows could be quite damaging to tender vegetation in the middle 20s in the extreme east and lower 30s elsewhere,” the weather service office in Cleveland warned. Even parts of Georgia and the Gulf Coast states will dip close to freezing, as the big chill stretches as far south as the Gulf Coast. For parts of the northern tier and Midwest tired of the cold, and ready for the warmth of spring and summer, the cooler temps are having a beneficial impact on the region by slowing the inevitable flooding from snowmelt. The spring snowmelt is well underway, leading to major flooding across the Upper Midwest and along the Mississippi River. We talked about this occurring back in March, and now it is actually happening. This week, cities along the Mississippi River from Minneapolis to Burlington, Iowa, could experience flooding as more than 30 river gauges reach major flood stage. Unlike flash flooding, which occurs very rapidly, this is seasonal, spring river flooding, which is occurring rather gradually as record to near record snowpack across the Upper Midwest melts. This winter several cities in the Upper Midwest saw exceptional snowfall: Additional snowmelt across the Upper Midwest is expected to add more water to the rivers and streams this week. With forecast temperatures at or below average and minimal rainfall where snow is still on the ground, melting is expected to remain gradual. Cities experiencing flood effects this week and into the weekend include Minneapolis-St. Paul; Winona, Minnesota; La Crosse, Wisconsin; and McGregor, Dubuque and Davenport in Iowa. Riverside parks and city streets are expected to become submerged in floodwater. The river flooding will continue to move downstream along the Mississippi River as we move into May. Severe weather will start ramping up Tuesday and Wednesday across the South. While damaging winds and hail will be the main threats, tornadoes can’t be ruled out. On Tuesday, the Storm Prediction Center highlighted an area encompassing nearly 10 million people in Texas. Places like Dallas-Fort Worth are included in what the storm center has labeled as having a Level 2 of 5 “slight risk” of severe weather. “At this juncture, it appears Tuesday could end up being more of a low-coverage but high-impact day, perhaps with only a few storms but a higher-end threat potential,” the weather service office in Fort Worth said. There is a broader risk of severe weather stretching into Oklahoma, along with portions of southern Colorado and New Mexico. The Level 1 risk area includes San Antonio, Houston and Oklahoma City. Areas hit hard last week in Oklahoma from tornadoes, could experience strong storms once again. Despite the uncertainty in how the severe weather will unfold, “all severe hazards are possible,” the weather service office in Norman, Oklahoma, warned. By Wednesday, the severe threat broadens, still including many of the same areas from Tuesday. More than 10 million people are covered by Wednesday’s Level 2 risk for severe weather, including the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. A Level 1 risk extends to the north and south including places like San Antonio, Austin and Oklahoma City. The threat of flash flooding will also be a concern. The Weather Prediction Center has issued a Level 2 of 4 “slight risk” of excessive rainfall for Tuesday and Wednesday, mostly overlapping the areas with severe potential. “Multiple rounds of heavier rain are expected Tuesday into Wednesday which will bring a slight risk for flooding,” the weather service office in Norman, Oklahoma, warned in a tweet. The area could see up to four inches of rain through Wednesday. By the second half of the week, the severe weather and flash flood threat should be winding down across the midsection of the country.

      Severe thunderstorms threaten more than 15 million today from the South to the Northeast after flooding triggered water rescues in Texas’ capital
    ","The same weather system that spawned tornadoes, deadly storms and water rescues in the central US continues to lash Texas with heavy rain as it crawls east early Friday, putting more than 15 million people at risk of severe thunderstorms from the South and Midwest to the Northeast. Get the latest on your forecast here Strong thunderstorms with large hail, gusty winds and isolated tornadoes could whip parts of the upper Texas coastal plain into the lower Mississippi Valley, along with the upper Ohio Valley into the lower Great Lakes region, the Storm Prediction Center said. A small section of South Texas, including Brownsville, faces a Level 2 of 5 “slight risk” of severe weather, while places including Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Cleveland; and Buffalo, New York, are under a Level 1 of 5 “marginal risk.” A flash flooding threat runs from the mid-Mississippi Valley to the Gulf Coast. Floods triggered by Thursday’s storm system forced some in Austin, Texas, to yell for help as storms overnight Thursday prompted water rescues across the capital. One person ended up in the hospital after a group got trapped between a fence and creek, Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services said. Six more were rescued after cars piled up in a creek, the agency said. Crews also used ropes to get to two people who couldn’t move amid high water. And the Austin Fire Department plucked a driver from the deluge after a report a motorist was sitting atop a car, it said. At least one tornado report was recorded in Tyler, Texas, on Thursday night, a day after more than a dozen tornadoes were reported across Oklahoma, Iowa and Kansas. Alerts for large hail, damaging winds and the possibility of tornadoes also led to temporary ground stops Thursday night at San Antonio and Austin–Bergstrom international airports as the areas faced a “life-threatening” flash flood warning, the National Weather Service said. Among the places hardest-hit after Wednesday’s tornado reports is the town of Cole, Oklahoma, where two people were reported dead in the community of 600, officials said. A third weather-related death was also reported in central Oklahoma. The deaths came after a tornado with an estimated peak wind speed between 150 and 155 mph struck the town about 30 miles south of Oklahoma City, according to the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma.. The tornado – rated an EF-3 due to its wind speed – traveled for about 11 miles inside McClain County in about 35 minutes, the survey determined. Another tornado packing estimated peak winds of between 130 and 135 mph swept across the city of Shawnee in Pottawatomie County, data from the preliminary survey shows. That tornado was rated an EF-2. Meanwhile, an EF-2 tornado also struck the town of Etowah, home to some 160 people in Cleveland County, and traveled for about 10.5 miles, the preliminary survey found. Many areas in Oklahoma experienced some form of severe weather Wednesday, but the Cole and Shawnee areas sustained the most significant storm damages, the state’s Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said in an update Thursday. Between 50 and 100 homes were damaged in Cole, and another 100 were damaged in Shawnee, according to the update, though assessments are still ongoing. “Our county was hit hard and it will take a while for every area to be checked,” the Pottawatomie County emergency management agency said after the tornado struck. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt declared a state of emergency for McClain, Pottawatomie, Cleveland, Lincoln and Oklahoma counties due to the severe storms and tornadoes.

      More severe storms brewing Thursday as rescue work continues after 3 died in Oklahoma amid tornadoes
    ","More severe storms are threatening some 50 million people from Texas to Wisconsin after the same system left at least three people dead in Oklahoma, with a dozen tornadoes reported across three states and search-and-rescue still underway in some places. Numerous severe thunderstorm warnings are in effect Thursday from Texas to Illinois as thunderstorms are producing large hail and strong winds. A tornado warning is in effect in Illinois for a storm about 30 miles southwest of Peoria, and conditions are favorable for tornadoes to develop across northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin through the evening hours. The toll of two fatalities, plus injuries, in Cole near Oklahoma City could climb as damage assessments continue, Deputy Scott Gibbons with the McClain County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. First responders have gotten reports of people trapped in shelters, and teams searching systematically across a 10-mile path must navigate roads littered with downed power lines and debris, he added. Someone hurt in Pottawatomie County in central Oklahoma also died at a hospital, Gibbons said. Get the latest on your forecast here The same system that spawned Wednesday’s severe storms is heading east Thursday, with rain, hail, damaging winds and some tornadoes and flash flooding possible. Areas from the hill country of Texas to southern Illinois – including Dallas, Houston and Chicago, plus Little Rock, Arkansas; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Jefferson City and Springfield, Missouri – face a Level 2 out of 5 “slight risk” of severe weather, the Storm Prediction Center said. A tornado watch is in effect for more than 14 million people in northern Illinois, eastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin, including Chicago and Milwaukee, until 8 p.m. CDT Thursday, according to the center. A few tornadoes, wind gusts up to 75 mph and large hail up to 2 inches in diameter are possible with these storms this afternoon and evening. Severe thunderstorm watches are in effect for central Illinois to central Texas. St. Louis; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Shreveport, Louisiana, are included in the watches, which extend into the evening. Strong winds and large hall are the primary concerns in these areas, but isolated tornadoes are also possible. Wednesday’s worst storms were reported across Oklahoma – where eight tornadoes have been confirmed by the National Weather Service office in Norman – while Kansas and Iowa also were hit. About 17,000 homes and businesses in Oklahoma had no power midday Thursday. A reported tornado in Cole, home to more than 600 people about 30 miles south of Oklahoma City, appears to have been one of the most significant. To resident Barry Harbison, it felt like a roller-coaster when the storm lifted his trailer home off the ground and tossed it – while he was stuck in it, he said. “I stayed in the bathroom and (the storm) picked up the whole trailer and moved it,” Harbison told CNN affiliate KOCO. The National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma, plans to survey Cole, Shawnee and the Etowah-Pink-Stella area Thursday. In addition to nine reports of tornadoes in Oklahoma, four tornado reports were recorded in Iowa and three in Kansas on Wednesday; of those, two tornadoes in Iowa and one in Kansas were preliminarily confirmed. About 60 miles east of Cole, a large and very dangerous tornado traipsed through Shawnee, a city of about 30,000 people in Pottawatomie County. The storm was moving erratically north of the city around 10 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Norman said. Shawnee Public Schools canceled classes Thursday, the district announced on Facebook. More than 30 residents at Brookdale Senior Living, an assisted living facility in Shawnee, Oklahoma, were evacuated after the building’s windows were blown out and water seeped inside, according to Shelee Stewart, the executive director. “We’ve been blessed everybody is alive,” Stewart told KOCO, noting there were no major injuries. Stewart described the staff who helped guide residents to the bathrooms while the storm passed as “heroes,” adding some had minor scratches. As crews spread out in the county to respond to the storms, the Pottawatomie County emergency management agency warned residents not to leave their homes to observe the damage, noting that hinders response efforts. “There is tremendous amounts of ponding on areas storms have come through so please do not drive through the water!” the agency said. “Our county was hit hard and it will take a while for every area to be checked,” the agency later said. “If you can, check on your neighbors, but be mindful of potential gas leaks and possibly downed power lines,” Shawnee Police said Wednesday evening in a Facebook post. Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee also canceled classes Thursday and Friday after urging students to avoid being outdoors. No injuries were reported, but the campus was significantly damaged, the university said. “Authorities are advising students to stay in their housing units through the night,” due to downed power lines and scattered debris, the school said. The main threats from Thursday’s severe weather will be large hail and strong winds – and tornadoes can’t be ruled out. “The areas of most concern are eastern North Texas (including the DFW Metro) and much of Central Texas, though areas east of I-35 will see the higher likelihood for severe storms,” said the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding in some locations. Most areas will see 1 to 3 inches of rain, with more in isolated spots. There is also a much broader Level 1 out of 5 “marginal risk” of storms Thursday from South Texas to the Midwest, including Memphis, Tennessee. These areas could also see strong winds, damaging hail and an isolated tornado. ",939,weather,2023-04-19,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/weather/oklahoma-tornado-central-us-storms/index.html

      A 3D-printing company is preparing to build on the lunar surface. But first, a moonshot at home
    ","Jason Ballard, the CEO and co-founder of 3D printing architecture company ICON, doesn’t mince his words. “There are certain people who are content to build a really ugly or uninspiring world,” he said. “We’re not. The day I walk outside and see something ugly being built by one of my robots – that’s a nightmare scenario for me.” Ballard, a quick-talking Texan in a 10-gallon hat, has a vision for the future of architecture.  Others are buying into it. Since launching in 2017, Austin-based ICON has received close to half a billion dollars in funding, won a contract with NASA and paired up with influential architects like Bjarke Ingels. If all goes according to plan, ICON will be building on the moon before the end of the decade. But first, the CEO wanted to discuss a moonshot much closer to home. ICON made its name creating houses using a high strength concrete it calls “Lavacrete,” printed in layers to form walls. A large machine ICON named the “Vulcan” does the printing, fed by an on-site mixing system dubbed “Magma.” The company’s first house was unveiled in 2018, and since then its operations have scaled up, from a collection of six homes in 2020 to a 100-home community north of Austin currently under construction (the largest printed community in the US). At each stage, the footprint of properties has increased, from 350 square feet to over 2,000 square feet, as the technology has advanced and 3D-printed homes have moved from prototype to novelty to relatively mainstream. A thread running through ICON’s work is building homes for disadvantaged people, including accommodation for the long-term homeless, often in collaboration with non-profits. Creating affordable housing is also an objective, which led the company to launch design competition Initiative 99 last month. Initiative 99 seeks submissions for homes that can be 3D-printed for $99,000 or less. Ballard described it as “a call to arms for the global architecture and design community” to get to grips with “one of the most pressing industries in need of a rethink.” A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2021 found about half of Americans reported affordable housing was a “major problem” in their area. One estimate from late 2020 calculated the US had a housing supply deficit of 3.8 million units. Peggy Bailey is vice president of housing and income security at progressive US think tank the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Bailey explained that in the US, many people struggle to pay for their accommodation. “Even before the pandemic and economic downturn, 23 million people lived in 11 million low-income households that paid more than 50% of their income for rent,” she told CNN via email. “Innovative ways to build housing are a promising step toward creating more affordable housing,” she added, while cautioning, “the housing affordability crisis isn’t due to a single issue or event. Multifaceted problems require multifaceted solutions.” The idea for Initiative 99 came from an internal exercise ICON has run every six months for the past five years, to see what can be constructed for $99,000 with the technology available. “This year we hit an inflection point,” said Ballard. “The results were very compelling. It immediately dawned on all of us (that) we’ve got to tell everybody about this.” The ICON CEO said Initiative 99’s $1 million prize fund will be the largest ever for an affordable housing competition. The competition will launch on May 23 and run for a year, with stages for concept development, schematic design and design development. There will be multiple winners and their designs will be built by ICON. Ballard hopes the competition receives entries tailored to meet cultures and contexts around the world, addressing specific needs and challenges. Bailey suggested the success of 3D-printed housing could hinge on how it is perceived by prospective residents. “One thing to keep in mind with any innovation in housing development, including 3D-development … is that the housing must fit in the rental market and be of the quality and style that any person would want to live in,” she said. Ballard said all ICON’s projects feed into one another: for example, the systems monitoring and support software it will use in the Initiative 99 homes was developed as part of its Project Olympus initiative, which is investigating building 3D-printed structures on the moon. Lunar concept designs, created in collaboration with Bjarke Ingles Group, were released in 2020, and in November 2022 ICON was awarded a $57 million contract by NASA, which will culminate in testing on the moon. Instead of Lavacrete, ICON is experimenting with using lunar regolith, the mineral-rich dust and rock that covers the moon’s surface. The regolith can be melted with a laser and turned into a ceramic-like material that is hard, durable and radiation-absorbing, explained Ballard. Parts of the construction system have been tested in a vacuum, and will next be tested in simulated lunar gravity, before being sent to the moon in 2026 or 2027, he added. The CEO stressed there are no plans for a lunar base yet, but ICON’s tests will represent a significant step in that direction. Some of ICON’s lunar ideas could find a civilian context too. Ballard is conscious that Lavacrete contains cement, which has a large carbon footprint, and said that ICON is researching ways to utilize locally sourced building materials on Earth that can compete with concrete. Patti Harburg-Petrich, principal at engineering consultancy Buro Happold, noted that some companies are already printing with materials other than concrete. The firm consulted on Mighty Buildings’ award-winning Mighty House, in California, which utilized prefabricated, 3D-printed composite stone material for its walls. She argued there was a strong case for 3D-printing’s sustainability credentials. “Oftentimes 3D-printed homes can be built faster and more sustainably when compared to traditional construction,” Harburg-Petrich said via email, pointing to a reduction in building materials wasted in construction. In recent years, there has been growing ambition around 3D-printing. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D-printing technology by 2030, and the city is home to the world’s largest 3D-printed structure by volume – a two-story local government office built by Apis Cor in 2019. The first multi-story 3D-printed building in the US was unveiled in September 2022, and the tallest 3D-printed building in the world is a 9.9 meter (32.5 foot), three-story house in Saudi Arabia, completed last November – both realized using printing technology by Danish company COBOD. Ballard says ICON is also planning to print multi-story buildings, and has triplex and quadplex designs in the works. ICON is developing the next generation of its Vulcan printing system, capable of building much bigger projects, Ballard said, adding that the company aims to eventually create a system in which three or four machines can be operated by a single person. “You should expect it to be a lot faster, you should expect it to be a lot more autonomous,” he added. This thinking comes as the design and construction sectors in the US face a skilled labor shortage, noted Harburg-Petrich. Along with more affordable and transportable 3D-printing systems, in the future, “we also need a workforce that is adaptable to 3D-printed construction technology,” she said. 3D-construction at scale, with an emphasis on affordable housing, is where Ballard wants to take ICON. In the case of Initiative 99, the winning designs will be released for free, meaning anyone with the tools can create the houses themselves. “I feel like the future can be amazing,” said Ballard. “But I’m also haunted by this understanding of history and human behavior, because it’s not guaranteed to be amazing. We have to make it so. And we’re going to have to take some risks to make it so.” ",1295,,style-article-icon-3d-printing-architecture-initiative-99-project-olympus-spc-intl-scn,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/icon-3d-printing-architecture-initiative-99-project-olympus-spc-intl-scn/index.html

      Four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers headed from Green Bay Packers to New York Jets in trade for draft picks
    ","The Green Bay Packers and New York Jets have agreed to trade longtime Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers to the Big Apple, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst told reporters Monday. Gutekunst said the trade has not yet been finalized as the two sides work out the details, but he expects the trade to be completed soon. The long-awaited trade will reportedly see the four-time NFL Most Valuable Player sent to the Jets along with the Packers’ 15th overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, according to reports from ESPN and NFL Network. The Packers will receive the Jets’ 13th overall pick in this month’s draft, as well as one of the Jets’ second-round picks and their 2024 first-round draft pick if Rodgers plays at least 65% of the Jets’ offensive plays this season, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported. Rodgers, 39, has spent his entire 18-season NFL career with the Packers, where he led the team to a 31-25 victory in Super Bowl XLV in 2011. The NFL Draft begins Thursday night in Kansas City, Missouri. During a regular appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” in March, Rodgers said his intention was to continue playing in the NFL, specifically for the Jets. “(From) my side – love, appreciation and gratitude for everything that Green Bay has done for me. So much love and gratitude and just heart open for Packers fans and what it meant to be their quarterback,” he said in March. “And also the reality of situation – it is what it is – the Packers would like to move on. They’ve let me know that in so many words. … They’ve let other people know that in direct words. “And because I still have that fire and I want to play and I would like to play in New York, it’s just a matter of getting that done at this point.” CNN has reached out to the Packers and the Jets for more information. Rodgers won MVP awards in 2011, 2014, 2020 and 2021 while setting numerous records for his accuracy and deadliness over the years. Despite all the personal successes, Rodgers and the Packers failed to win more championship rings, wracking up numerous painful playoff losses over the years. In recent years, Rodgers has voiced a creeping dissatisfaction with events in Green Bay, from the lack of offensive weapons he’s had to work with to the drafting of his apparent heir, Jordan Love, in the first round of the 2020 draft. Rodgers had hinted that retirement was an option on more than one occasion, and even visited a darkness retreat this offseason as he sought clarity on his future. Though his ability to avoid on-rushing defenders may have diminished with age, Rodgers has more than made up for it with his precision and canniness before the snap, while he has the knack of maneuvering defenses to his will. Last season, the Packers started poorly but Rodgers lead the team on a four-game winning streak from a 4-8 record to help set up a Week 18 game with the Detroit Lions for a spot in the playoffs. Green Bay lost 20-16 to end the Packers’ season. ",526,sport,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/sport/aaron-rodgers-packers-jets-nfl-spt-intl/index.html

      Radio DJ Adele Roberts breaks record for fastest woman with an ileostomy to run the London Marathon
    ","British radio presenter Adele Roberts became the fastest woman to complete the London Marathon with an ileostomy, running the distance in just over three and a half hours on Sunday. The Guinness World Records awarded Roberts with a framed certificate at the finish line, writing on Twitter: “Adele Roberts completed the fastest marathon with an ileostomy (female) in 3:30:22. Congratulations, Adele!” Roberts, who is known for working on BBC Radio 1 in the UK, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2021 and began using a stoma bag after undergoing surgery 18 months ago. The 44-year-old only stopped chemotherapy less than 12 months ago but recovered in time to set a new record. “Thank you to every single person who has helped make today possible,” Roberts wrote on Instagram after the race. “For those warriors living with cancer, for all the incredible ostomates around the UK and for the heroes of the NHS. That was for you.” An ileostomy is a procedure to create an opening to bring the end of the small bowel through an opening in the abdomen. The opening can be temporary or permanent. A disposable bag is then worn over the ileostomy to collect stool, rather than it passing out of the rectum. “This means I currently have no use of my large colon,” Roberts wrote on her fundraising page. “Turns out colons are quite handy for hydration and food and running marathons.” It usually takes six to eight weeks to recover from an ileostomy but people should avoid strenuous activity for three months, according to NHS. After the race, Roberts posted a video on Instagram of her presenting her ileostomy – which she has named Audrey – with a tiny replicable finishers medal. Roberts was one of thousands of runners to complete the London Marathon on Sunday which raised millions for charitable causes. Dutch runner Sifan Hassan and Kenya’s Kelvin Kiptum won the women’s and men’s elite races respectively.

      Sifan Hassan lays claim to being greatest female distance runner with thrilling London Marathon victory
    ","Running is a simple sport, the art of putting one foot in front of the other faster than your other competitors. That’s precisely what Sifan Hassan did in the London Marathon on Sunday, though her stunning, chaotic victory in the women’s race was anything but straightforward. “There were so many dramas,” Hassan told reporters after the race, “so many dramas – but it’s beautiful.” A three-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champion on the track, the win in London, one of the world’s six marathon majors, is the latest addition to the Dutch athlete’s remarkable running CV. Hassan spent much of her debut marathon wondering when she would drop out having stopped to stretch an injured hip just after the hour mark. She later said she had forgotten to tape up her leg before taking to the start line. Incredibly, Hassan appeared to shake off the injury and even picked up her pace as she gained on the lead group. She had made up the lost ground by the closing stages, narrowly avoiding further disaster when she swerved towards a motorbike to collect her bottle from a drinks station. Apparently unshaken by the near miss, Hassan recovered and had enough energy to outsprint Ethiopia’s Alemu Megertu and Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir, the Olympic marathon champion, in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, breaking the finish tape in two hours, 18 minutes, and 34 seconds. Not many athletes are able to replicate their success on the track over the 26.2 miles of the marathon, let alone at the first time of asking. But Hassan, who won 5,000 and 10,000-meter golds at the Tokyo Olympics and a bronze in the 1,500 meters, is no ordinary athlete, such is her talent over a range of distances. She later downplayed the suggestion that she is the greatest female distance runner of all time. “I’m not the greatest, I’m just okay,” the 30-year-old said. “I don’t need to become the greatest. I’m fine the way I am.” Consider her buildup for Sunday’s race and Hassan’s victory is even less believable. She said she hadn’t done much marathon-specific training as she was fasting for Ramadan and therefore unable to fuel and hydrate sufficiently for long runs. Rather than making a long-term commitment to the marathon, Hassan thought she would test herself over the longer distance and still race on the track this summer. It was a decision she started to regret on the morning of the race. “I was telling myself that I’m stupid that I decided to run the marathon,” said Hassan. “I even cried, [thinking]: why have I decided to run the marathon? “I was so scared. This morning, I was telling Tim [Rowberry], my coach, ‘Why did I decide to run the marathon? What is wrong with me?” It wasn’t until she crossed the finish line that she finally believed she would win the race. What kept her going, Hassan said, was finding the “spirit” to fuel herself for her next marathon. “It was not 100% I’m going to finish – it did not come into my mind,” she added. The Ethiopian-born Hassan, who moved to Netherlands as a refugee aged 15, ranked her victory in a rain-soaked London on par with her three medals at the Tokyo Olympics. Prior to that, she broke the 23-year-old mile world record at the start of 2019 and won 1,500 and 10,000-meter golds at the world championships a few months later. Her marathon debut set the tone for another thrilling performance in the men’s elite race as Kenya’s Kelvin Kiptum set a course record of two hours, one minute and 25 seconds – the second-fastest marathon time ever behind Eliud Kipchoge’s world record from last year’s Berlin Marathon. The 23-year-old Kiptum, who ran the fastest-ever debut marathon in Valencia last year, finished nearly three minutes ahead of compatriot Geoffrey Kamworor in second, while Ethiopia’s Tamirat Tola was a further 36 seconds back in third. “I am so happy with the result,” Kiptum told the BBC, according to Reuters. “I don’t know what to say right now, I am just grateful.” ",682,sport,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/sport/sifan-hassan-london-marathon-spt-intl/index.html

      Paul Rudd films emotional moment between Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney after Wrexham secures promotion
    ","When the referee blew the full-time whistle confirming Wrexham’s promotion from the National League for the first time in 15 years, the club’s Hollywood owners could scarcely believe it. Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, who had promised to transform the club after their takeover in 2021, looked temporarily winded and almost sunk to their knees as thousands of fans celebrated inside the Racecourse Ground. It was an emotional moment captured by fellow Hollywood stalwart Paul Rudd, who filmed the pair in the immediate aftermath of Saturday’s 3-1 win over Boreham Wood. After a moment to themselves, Reynolds and McElhenney then shared a long hug before the latter appeared to wipe away tears from his eyes. The pair then turned to celebrate with the sea of fans who had run onto the pitch. “Rob and I kinda blacked out during this moment, but somehow we’ll never forget it,” Reynolds wrote on Twitter, sharing the video taken by Rudd. It was an emotional moment that the team’s supporters had been longing for and, such is the way at Wrexham these days, they were joined in celebration by a long list of famous faces. ‘Ant-Man’ star Rudd has been one of many Hollywood A-listers to visit Wrexham in recent months and the 54-year-old appeared to enjoy his time in Wales. Footage and photographs on social media showed Rudd drinking in the local pub and meeting excited Wrexham fans ahead of Saturday’s match. Many other celebrities took to social media to congratulate Wrexham after its promotion into the Football League. Oscar-winning Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins replied to a tweet from Reynolds branding him an “honorary Welsh boyo,” while former England player Gary Lineker congratulated the club on its achievement. “I fancy the next series might be a decent watch,” Lineker tweeted, in reference to the ‘Welcome to Wrexham’ TV series released last year which documented the club’s fortunes since the takeover. As well as acting royalty, the Prince of Wales also tweeted after Wrexham secured promotion. “A club with such amazing history, looking forward to a very exciting future back in the Football League. Doing Wales proud,” Prince William wrote. While the club’s new high profile fans sprinkle a touch of stardust to proceedings, Saturday’s win was for the lifelong fans who have endured a difficult ride of late. ]The historic small town club, which was once in the higher echelons of English football, had been on the brink of extinction in 2011 and had struggled to compete on the pitch. But since the takeover, the club has been transformed and will play in League Two next season, the fourth-tier of English football. Three further promotions and Wrexham would be in the English Premier League. Such a notion may appear farfetched, but the surreal has become all too normal for Wrexham supporters of late. “I think we can hear how it feels to the town and that’s what’s most important for us – I think this is a moment of catharsis for them,” co-owner McElhenney told reporters after Saturday’s game. “For us to be welcomed into their community and to be welcomed into this experience has been the moment of my life.” ",528,football,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/football/wrexham-promotion-paul-rudd-hollywood-reaction-spt-intl/index.html

      This CNN Hero is recruiting recreational divers to help rebuild reefs in Florida one coral at a time
    ","Mike Goldberg spent his early career working in financial services, putting in long hours for 12 years, he said, before he decided it was time to call it quits. “I was just chasing money,” he said. “But I realized that is not me. … It just wasn’t true to my core.” In 1996, Goldberg left his job and his home in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving, spending time in Hawaii, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands. “When I got out of the water after my very first dive, I decided that this is what I really wanted to do … to take my life and somehow intertwine diving and making a living,” he said. In 2004, Goldberg and his family settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives. Today, he’s on a mission to help bring the area’s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit, I.CARE. As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. They not only support all kinds of species, but they protect coastal areas, and millions of people depend on them for food and jobs. Over the last two decades, he saw coral reefs in the Florida Keys go from colorful and full of life to functionally extinct today. What he used to see were “brain coral the size of a VW Beetle, and fields of staghorn and elkhorn coral that went on forever,” he said. Now, he says many of the reefs in the area cannot recover naturally on their own and require human intervention to survive. Goldberg knew he needed to do something to help and wanted to find a way to get other people involved. “I know more about the history of and what’s happening now to the reef than most people,” he said. “I’m not a scientist, but that puts me in a unique position to communicate in layman’s terms about what’s going on.” He realized that recreational divers could be a great workforce to help turn around the damage and restore the reefs. He also envisioned that other local dive shops, residents, and tourists could play a role. Around the same time, he met Dr. Kylie Smith, who was completing her PhD to become a behavioral ecologist and a coral reef ecologist. They spent hours at Goldberg’s dive shop discussing the health of the reef. In 2019, they teamed up to co-found I.CARE, which stands for Islamorada Conservation and Restoration Education, with the goal of empowering divers to help restore the area’s reefs, ensuring their survival for future generations. I.CARE organizes and offers special coral restoration dives for local and out-of-town participants. They spend the day learning about the importance of coral reefs and how to help rebuild them, then they go on dives to transplant coral grown in a local nursery run by Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium. So far, Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it’s thriving. “There’s so much work to do. We’re just getting started,” Goldberg said. CNN’s Laura Klairmont spoke with Goldberg about his efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: What has caused the degradation of the coral reefs in the Florida Keys? Mike Goldberg: The Keys in general – the ocean, the coral reef, the marine life – used to be the best anywhere. When I moved here 20 years ago, (there were) massive elkhorn corals that I used to swim around that were 12 feet across in both directions. Fields of them and stalks like trees that you could swim underneath on your back and marvel looking up at. Back then, we could swim a quarter mile in one direction and see nothing more than a quarter inch between the live coral. The live coral would compete for that underwater territory. Today, I could swim 20 feet in one direction and not see any. We’ve lost so much coral. It’s hard to express it. It truly is a pretty devastating number. The coral reefs are threatened by ocean acidification, temperature, runoff. And then in 2014, there was something we called stony coral tissue loss disease. (It) was the sledgehammer that changed everything. It is incredibly virulent, and it started up near Miami and worked its way down. In 2016, it presented itself here, and we lost more coral in that one year than we did in all my prior years combined in diving. It was so dramatic watching this coral head die all in front of us. And we didn’t know what to do, how to stop it. It was very hard to watch, and feel helpless, wishing you could do something to stop it. CNN: Why are coral reefs so important to the health of the ocean? Goldberg: Without them, nothing is here simply put. They are what brings the ecosystem together. The majority of what we see out there at one point in their life is spending time on a coral reef. There’s small fish, not bigger than a grain of rice, all the way up to your large predatory fish, tiger sharks. The entire ecosystem’s right there out on the reef at any given point. Whether it’s a neon goby, whether it’s a cleaner shrimp, whether it’s a juvenile Spanish hogfish. Without that live coral as their home, that disappears. And when they’re gone, we have fewer snappers, grouper. It’s just a cascade effect because that goes all the way up the food chain. So, it’s imperative that we have a healthy coral reef for us to have a full ecosystem. Without a coral reef, there’s so many problems that will ensue. CNN: What is unique about your approach to the work? Goldberg: I knew the only way that I could make it work is through the power of the recreational dive community. What I believed would work, and is, (is they’re) coming down and helping us rebuild the reef. There are a lot of them. And I truly believe at their core the vast majority want to be a part of this. And my experience so far has been just that. They want to keep doing it. They love being part of it. What I can do is tell the world of divers that are out there, “Let’s band together. This is a plight not only for the Keys, but the Caribbean, for the Pacific, for the Red Sea. It’s all around the world. And if we, as a community of divers, don’t attempt to bring back or at least get it to a self-sustaining level, the dive community will disappear.” This avenue gives those individuals another reason to come diving. They can be talking to their friends, to their families, getting them excited and spreading out those tendrils so we get more and more people down here helping us rebuild the reef. I truly believe we’re going to be successful with this restoration work. I see things every time I go in the water that give me hope that we will have a sustaining coral reef. Want to get involved?

      This CNN Hero offers judgment-free veterinary care for the pets of those experiencing homelessness
    ","Dr. Kwane Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago as a personal mission that he kept to himself. “It was my way to heal,” said Stewart, a veterinarian whose nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness. “Maybe some of it was guilt. Maybe some of it was I just wanted my own little crusade.” Stewart had spent several years working in a county shelter in Northern California when he thought about quitting in 2011. He’d long dreamed of saving animals but was instead forced to euthanize an increasing number of those that were being surrendered. “It was the recession. I’m seeing hordes of unwanted pets dropped off, people who don’t have the money to feed them or care for them medically,” Stewart, 53, said. “It started to steal a part of my soul. I thought about leaving the veterinary profession altogether.” Stewart was at a crossroads, he said, desperately trying to lower the shelter’s rates of euthanasia and increase adoption rates, but also struggling with the sheer number of animals dropped off there. On a whim one morning, he stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee. “I’d seen this guy before and ignored him. Regrettably, just walked by him,” Stewart said. “And on this day, I just broke pattern because I noticed his dog had some sort of serious skin condition.” Stewart diagnosed and treated the dog’s condition, and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was the real wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter. “That was the moment I said to myself, ‘I’m going to do more of this. I’m going to get back to saving animals on my terms. And I’m going to do it for passion, not for pay.’” Soon after, Stewart began to do more outreach, setting up small drop-in clinics to provide medical care to pets whose owners couldn’t afford it and walking the streets looking for unhoused individuals whose pets needed help. Right away he was struck by how much the pet owners cared for their beloved animals. “They’re with each other 24/7 hours a day. Their bond and relationship is on a different level,” Stewart said. “Because they’re not in a traditional home, it doesn’t necessarily make them less of a pet parent. A pet doesn’t care about nice furniture and a big home, they want to spend it with you.” And he found that many pet owners wanted to share their stories about their dog and their history together. With their consent, Stewart’s brother, Ian, eventually began documenting some of the work and personal stories to raise awareness about animal welfare and homelessness. “They probably get criticized more than anything, especially from people in the outside world. But I’ve seen people give up their last meal for their pet and people who have $3 to their name, and after I’m done with the treatment, they will try and give me that $3,” Stewart said. His brother encouraged him to spread the word and join forces with others to provide street care, and soon more like-minded animal welfare professionals jumped on board. Genesis Rendon, a registered veterinary nurse who Stewart calls his “right-hand,” had worked in the veterinary field for nearly two decades and was doing her own street outreach when she teamed up with him in 2016. Today, as a lead volunteer for Project Street Vet, she is often by Stewart’s side in homeless camps and on Los Angeles’ Skid Row assisting animals in need. “Now it’s spreading across the country,” Stewart said. “I’m building a network of trusted volunteers, technicians with hospitals and clinics we can call on. These are all people who just reached out and said, ‘I’m inspired by what you do. How do I do it?’” Stewart says they can treat about 80% of the cases they see out of a small portable kit. Treatments include antibiotics, vaccines, and anti-inflammatories as well as deworming and flea and tick medications. “It’s boots on the ground,” Stewart said, adding that their group will also help connect animals in need to clinic services. “And whenever we can, we advocate for or assist people in getting their animals spayed and neutered.” Stewart’s work with Project Street Vet is all volunteer, and the organization has expanded to other cities, including Orlando and Atlanta. “It doesn’t matter what your situation is or what your background or past is, I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help. … It’s at no cost to them. It’s free.” Since he started, Stewart and his volunteer teams have treated thousands of animals while giving their human parents hope and dignity, too. “I will say this about the people I’ve met who have pets on the streets,” he said. “They are some of the most remarkable pet parents I’ve ever met.” Want to get involved?

      Don’t give up on milestones: A CNN Hero’s message for Autism Awareness Month
    ","Every April, during Autism Awareness Month, Debra Vines and her nonprofit field a surge of calls from parents needing autism-related services and resources. It’s a phenomenon she says she would prefer to see year-round. “Autism Awareness Month is every day for me,” said Vines, a 2022 Top 10 CNN Hero. She and her organization, The Answer Inc., provide support, services, and education for Black and Brown families in the Chicago area who are impacted by autism. Vines’ 35-year-old son, Jason, has autism, and she knows first-hand the everyday struggles that families face. “Children and adults that live with autism are very repetitive – everything that they do, it’s the same way. But when you have a career, or are parents that have other children and other responsibilities, sometimes it can be very, very, very, very challenging,” she said. Vines and her late husband, James Harlan, co-founded The Answer Inc. 16 years ago after realizing they were not alone in their struggle to find the support, resources, education, and services Jason desperately needed. Since then, their nonprofit has helped more than 4,000 families in underserved communities. She notes that the need continues to grow. “With the numbers going up every day, we need support from the community every day.” According to the CDC, about 1 in 36 children in the United States has been identified with autism spectrum disorder. And research shows that early intervention services can improve learning, communication, and social skills, as well as brain development. For Vines, Autism Awareness Month helps her advocate for families who are unsure what to do after receiving an autism diagnosis. “I think it opens up eyes to this disability and the things that we need,” she said. “We would have to work even harder as providers to get the word out about autism.” One area where Vines sees the greatest need is for adults with autism, who age out of many programs at 22. “It’s almost like they fall off the face of the earth,” she said. “There’s hardly any resources available for them.” The Answer Inc. addresses this need with programs like Spectrum University, which helps participants ages 13 to 40 enter the workforce by connecting them with employers. Her organization is also working to educate the community at large about autism, including training first responders and other public workers to recognize the signs and symptoms of autism. “I would like to see (families) have more integral resources within the community, within the park districts, within the businesses,” she said. Vines says her son, Jason, is doing “amazing” and reaching new milestones. She has been working with him on social skills like saying “please” and “thank you.” The other day, she swept up some trash at home and asked Jason to help her pick it up. He surprised her by asking her to “say please.” It’s moments like this that remind Vines why she and others in the autism community continue to do the hard work, year-round. “I encourage families every single day not to give up because you never know when that light bulb is just gonna go off, and they’re gonna hit another milestone.” ",525,us,2023-04-07,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/07/us/chicago-autism-awareness-month-cnnheroes/index.html

      CNN Hero of the Year Nelly Cheboi returned to Kenya with plans to lift more students out of poverty
    ","Just weeks after being named the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year, Nelly Cheboi traveled more than 7,000 miles to bring her award home. Far from the lights, cameras, and celebrities who surrounded her at the gala event in New York City, Cheboi was greeted by her own heroes: the students she serves in rural Mogotio, Kenya. “I felt a lot of hope just bringing the award to the kids,” Cheboi said. “For me, and for the community here, it really means a lot to be celebrated, to be seen.” Like many of her students, Cheboi grew up in poverty, without access to education and proper nutrition. Her single mother was often unable to afford school fees. “One of the hardest things about growing up in poverty is hopelessness. You think of yourself as less than,” Cheboi said. “I wanted to turn that into, ‘This can happen for you, too.’” Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa – which is short for Technologically Literate Africa – brings computer science to students using refurbished computers. Many of the children she serves had never used a computer before participating in Cheboi’s program. “Digital skills provide global opportunities,” Cheboi said. “These kids are doing so much. They have Zoom calls with NASA. They are so worldly.” Growing up, Cheboi watched her single mother work tirelessly so Cheboi and her siblings could attend school. She saw education as a means to end her own poverty and in 2012, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois and began her studies with almost no computer experience. “The only tool I had at the time was education,” Cheboi said. “I was able to rewrite my story within years.” Cheboi credits computer literacy with opening doors. She’s found job opportunities and has brought professional, academic, and financial support to her community in Africa. She also credits her mother, Christina, for her success. Cheboi chose her mother as her guest to accompany her at “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute” in New York. It was her mom’s first time on a plane. “I’m constantly looking for opportunities to show people this is Christina Cheboi and she happened to have four daughters, she’s worked really hard to educate them.” And when Cheboi’s name was announced as CNN Hero of the Year, the first face she saw from the stage was that familiar one. “I looked at the audience, it was my mom screaming back at me,” Cheboi said. “This was someone who had no idea that all her hard work is going to amount to something. … I don’t think it can get any bigger than that.” Cheboi not only won the award and a cash prize to continue her life-changing work, but she also received global accolades from people and places she never dreamed. The president of Kenya congratulated her the next day, and her alma matter, Augustana College, where her passion for computers started, created a Nelly Cheboi Endowment Fund and has invited Cheboi to be this year’s commencement speaker. “The coolest thing about being the CNN Hero of the Year was being the beacon of hope. There is hope. Poverty has an expiration date. This is all temporary,” she said. Now in 15 schools, Cheboi’s goal for the year is to set up computer labs and TechLit Africa programs in 100 schools in rural Africa. “I see a future in Kenya and in the rest of the continent where kids are becoming really tech literate. And then, in turn, becoming global citizens,” Cheboi said. “It’s a ripple effect. Some of them will help us in solving one of so many big challenges we have in the world today.” ",610,world,2023-03-31,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/31/world/kenya-tech-literacy-nelly-cheboi-cnnheroes/index.html

      Suspect in custody, one person dead after shooting at Oklahoma community college, police say
    ","A suspect is in custody and one person is dead after a shooting at Rose State College in Midwest City, Oklahoma, the city’s police chief said Monday. Chief Sid Porter told reporters the suspect and victim “are acquainted through a domestic situation.” Authorities say the suspect’s wife and the 20-year-old male victim – both students – were leaving the school’s humanities building when the suspect confronted them and began shooting. Officers who were assigned to patrol the campus had received reports of a person shot, responded to the area and found the suspect, Porter said. Witnesses identified the shooter, who placed his “gun into a backpack” after firing, according to a news release from police. Authorities say when he was confronted by officers, the suspect “got down on his knees, raised his hands and stated he surrendered.” The suspect is being held in the Oklahoma County jail and is accused of first-degree murder, according to online records. It is unclear whether he has an attorney. Police didn’t identify victim. Porter said students and staff did a “fantastic job” at responding to the incident at the community college east of Oklahoma City. He said the campus had an active shooter drill in the past few weeks. Rose State College is a public, two-year institution, it says on its website. It has more than 13,000 students and more than 60 academic programs. “We are currently experiencing an active shooter situation on campus,” Rose State College said earlier on Twitter. “Please shelter in place and follow instructions from law enforcement officials. More information to follow as it becomes available.” The lockdown was later lifted. 16CNN has reached out to the mayor’s office, the Midwest City Police Department, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and Rose State College for more information. People on campus were asked to leave after the end of the lockdown. “Please avoid the area south of Humanities and Administration Building. All activities and classes for the remainder of Monday, April 24 are cancelled,” a tweet from the college said. The campus will also be closed Tuesday, the school said, adding in a subsequent tweet it is working to provide counseling services for people who need it.

      A Texas family fought for weeks to regain custody of their newborn. Experts say the case shows how Black parents are criminalized.
    ","A Black Texas couple has been reunited with their newborn daughter after authorities removed the baby and placed her in foster care last month citing a doctor’s concerns about how they were treating a jaundice diagnosis. Rodney and Temecia Jackson of DeSoto, Texas, regained custody of their daughter, Mila, on April 20 following a nearly month-long battle with the state’s Child Protective Services, according to The Afiya Center, a reproductive justice advocacy group. A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Family Protective Services, which includes CPS, confirmed to CNN that the office had recommended a dismissal of the case to an assistant district attorney. Mila’s release was granted on Thursday, according to a court filing. The Jacksons had been pleading for Mila’s return in videos posted to social media, and news conferences as reproductive justice activists protested and rallied behind the family. The removal, the Jacksons say, was sparked by their decision to let their midwife treat Mila’s jaundice instead of taking her to the hospital for care as their doctor had recommended. Temecia Jackson said during a news conference earlier this month that she gave birth to Mila at home on March 21 with the help of a midwife and wanted that same trusted midwife to provide medical care for her baby. But Mila’s pediatrician disagreed with this decision and ultimately contacted CPS, Temecia Jackson said. “We’ve been treated like criminals,” Rodney Jackson said during the news conference. “This is a nightmare that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.” Reproductive justice advocates say Mila’s removal is just the latest example of the criminalization of Black parents, who lose their children to the child welfare system at disproportionate rates. In the US in 2018, Black children made up 23% of youth in foster care, but only 14% of the nation’s child population, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Additionally, one study found that between 2003-2014, 53% of Black children were the subjects of child welfare investigations by the time they reached age 18. Marsha Jones, executive director of The Afiya Center – a Dallas, Texas, based non-profit that advocates for Black women and girls –  said there is a systemic problem with the child welfare system that unfairly targets Black parents. In many cases, Black families have their first experiences with the criminal justice system in family court, Jones said. “It’s almost unspoken and unseen because there is just this thought that Black women are not good parents and that we are criminalized because of poverty,” Jones told CNN. “This is not new.” Jones said the center stepped in last month to support the Jackson family and put pressure on public officials to return Mila home. She believes this played a role in reuniting the family last week. “There’s no reason this baby should have been removed from her home,” Jones told CNN. “This family was not being heard. The Black midwife wasn’t being heard.” Rodney and Temecia Jackson could not be reached for comment. In a letter to CPS obtained by CNN affiliate WFAA, the family’s pediatrician, Dr. Anand Bhatt, who is with the Baylor Scott & White healthcare system, wrote that while the Jacksons “are very loving and they care dearly” about Mila, “their distrust for medical care and guidance has led them to make a decision for the baby to refuse a simple treatment that can prevent brain damage.” “I authorized the support of CPS to help get this baby the care that was medically necessary and needed,” the letter continued. CBS News, which obtained a copy of the affidavit filed by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, reported that Bhatt reached out to a DFPS investigator on March 25 and indicated that Mila’s bililrubin test showed levels of 21.7 milligrams. A bilirubin test can screen for jaundice and other conditions. That level was “cause for a lot of concern,” Bhatt told the investigator, according to CBS News, and could lead to brain damage, he said, “because the bilirubin can cross the blood brain barrier.” Bhatt said he reserved a bed for Mila at Children’s Medical Center of Dallas and asked the Jacksons to take her there or he would call police for a welfare check, according to court documents obtained by CBS News. WFAA reported that Bhatt wanted Mila to receive phototherapy – a common treatment for jaundice. But court documents, according to CBS News, say Rodney Jackson told Bhatt he and Temecia Jackson planned to treat their baby “naturally” and didn’t believe in “modern medicine.” The midwife, Cheryl Edinbyrd, told CBS News the family had ordered a blanket and goggles to provide light therapy to treat Mila’s jaundice. When the Jacksons didn’t show up at the hospital, a CPS investigator and police went to the Jackson’s home at 4 a.m. on March 25 but Rodney Jackson declined to speak with them, according to court documents obtained by CBS News. An hour later, authorities returned with an ambulance and fire truck and Rodney Jackson still denied them entry. Authorities returned to the home on March 30 with a warrant and arrested Rodney Jackson on charges of preventing the execution of a civil process, according to CBS News. Police entered the home and took Mila from Temecia Jackson. According to CBS News, the Jacksons’ other two children were not removed. Temecia Jackson said in a press conference that when she asked to see the affidavit, she noticed it had the name of a different mother on it. “Instantly I felt like they had stolen my baby as I had had a home birth and they were trying to say that my baby belonged to this other woman,” Temecia Jackson. Marissa Gonzales, a spokesperson from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, said in an email to CNN that her department was given an incorrect name for the initial affidavit. The mistake, she said, was corrected in the case filings. Gonzales declined an interview with CNN to discuss the case further, citing “state confidentiality restrictions.” “It is always the goal of DFPS to safely reunite children with their parents,” Gonzales also said. “The decision about when that happens rests with the judge who ordered the removal.” CNN’s request to interview Bhatt was also denied by Baylor Scott & White. “In respect of patient privacy, it is inappropriate to provide comment on this matter,” the health system said in an emailed statement. “We do abide by reporting requirements set forth in the Texas Family Code and any other applicable laws.” Advocates say the racial bias of professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers has created inequity in the child welfare system. Dorothy Roberts, a law professor and sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said decisions to report neglect and abuse are largely shaped by racist stereotypes of Black families. The child welfare system, she said, needs to consider the trauma inflicted on children when they are separated from their families. “We have to ask whether there is a better way of addressing children’s medical needs instead of the system we have now where doctors are reporting suspicions, which we know is highly biased, and investigating families, which we know is very traumatic,” said Roberts, author of “Torn Apart: How the Child Welfare System Destroys Black Families – and How Abolition Can Build a Safer World.” “Hospitals should not be places of fear for parents.” Roberts said there is also a longstanding cultural conflict between the healthcare system and midwives who are often devalued. Black midwives provided care for mothers for hundreds of years, delivering the babies of enslaved women and even slave owners’ wives. But as medicine became more professionalized in the late 1800s, male doctors wanted to take control of childbirth, with some suggesting midwives were unfit, according to a report by Vox. Monica Simpson, executive director of Sistersong, a reproductive justice organization advocating for women of color, said many Black women are choosing midwives because they have lost trust in doctors and hospitals. Much of that is driven by the harrowing statistics: Black women are 2.6 times likelier to die of pregnancy-related complications than White women, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Black infants also die at more than twice the rate of White infants, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Simpson said the child welfare system is broken. She said racism has played a part in the continued criminalization and separation of Black families. “There’s been this narrative that Black women can’t parent their children properly,” Simpson said. “We have been battling these narratives for decades. The way that Black women are criminalized around their motherhood, it’s horrible.” ",1446,us,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/us/texas-family-newborn-removed-reaj/index.html

      Driver of SUV that crashed into a Massachusetts Apple store accelerated to 60 mph before deadly crash, prosecutor says
    ","A man accused of driving an SUV into a Hingham, Massachusetts, Apple store last year – killing one person and injuring 22 others – now faces more than two dozen additional charges, including second-degree murder, as prosecutors say there were no signs the brakes were applied before the deadly crash. Bradley Rein, 53, drove up onto a sidewalk on November 21, 2022 crashed through the store’s glass door, went across the sales floor and slammed into a rear wall, striking and killing a 65-year-old construction worker who was in his path, Plymouth County Assistant District Attorney David Cutshall said in court. Rein was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the crash at the Derby Street Shops outdoor mall and pleaded not guilty to one charge of reckless homicide by motor vehicle. He now faces a host of new charges after a grand jury voted to indict him late last month on murder in the second degree and motor vehicle homicide by reckless operation. The panel also indicted Rein on 18 counts of aggravated assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, four counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, as well as reckless operation of a motor vehicle, according to the Plymouth County District Attorney’s office. Rein pleaded not guilty to the new charges in court on Monday. Rein – who prosecutors say had no drugs or alcohol in his system at the time of the crash – told police his right foot got stuck on the accelerator pedal and he was pressing on the brake with his other foot but couldn’t stop the vehicle from crashing into the store, Cutshall said. Electronic data downloaded from the SUV showed in the five seconds leading up to the crash, Rein’s vehicle accelerated to 60 mph, the prosecutor said. “There was no indication of brake application during those five seconds,” Cutshall told the court. An inspection of the vehicle also revealed “no mechanical defects that could have contributed to this crash,” Cutshall said, though, noting a police collision analysis and reconstruction report has not yet been finalized. Rein’s defense attorney told CNN the crash was an accident, and the vehicle has not yet been fully examined. “This was an accident. There was no intent,” defense attorney Joan Fund told CNN. “I am astonished by the second-degree murder charge. The accident reconstruction report has not been completed, the vehicle has not been fully examined due to the damage to the vehicle, and the data recording has contradictory information, and I look forward to litigating this in court.” The crash fueled numerous 911 calls and led to a large law enforcement response, with the Hingham fire chief describing first responders finding people “pinned against the wall by the vehicle.” Most of the 22 who were injured in the incident had serious injuries and were taken to local hospitals, Cutshall said. The man killed in the crash was identified as Kevin Bradley of New Jersey. “Obviously, at this point, there’s allegations of intentional conduct so that’s something we’ll have to deal with,” Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy Cruz told CNN affiliate WCVB. “We will make sure that there’s justice for Mr. Bradley, there’s justice for all the people whose lives were changed and altered forever.” Rein – who previously posted $100,000 bail – will be fitted with a GPS tracking device and was ordered to surrender his passport. He was also ordered not to leave the state without approval and told he can’t possess any weapons or operate a motor vehicle, as conditions of his bail, according to the district attorney’s office. He is scheduled to be back in court on June 21. ",609,us,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/us/massachusetts-hingham-apple-store-charges/index.html

      Advocacy groups sue to block an emergency rule limiting gender-affirming care that’s expected to go into effect this week in Missouri
    ","Advocacy groups sued the Missouri Attorney General Monday after he announced an “emergency rule” limiting transgender care for minors and adults – a rule that is expected to go into effect this week, his office announced this month. Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender, the gender by which one wants to be known. The new rule claims people often take “life-altering interventions,” like pubertal suppression or gender transition surgery, “without any talk therapy at all,” and that the emergency action is “needed because of a compelling governmental interest and a need to protect the public health, safety, and welfare” of Missourians. Among other stipulations, the rule says it’s “unlawful” for individuals or health care providers to provide gender-affirming care without confirming that a patient has “for at least the 3 most recent consecutive years … exhibited a medically documented, long-lasting, persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria.” The rule is expected to go into effect Thursday and will expire February 6, 2024, a release from Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office reads. Petitioners sued to stop the rule, asking the Circuit Court of Saint Louis County to declare it invalid “due to the Attorney General’s lack of statutory authority to promulgate it” in addition to other legal arguments, according to the petition filed by advocacy groups representing Southampton Community Healthcare in St. Louis and several providers and patients. “The Rule targets gender-affirming care with unprecedented and unique restrictions so onerous that it effectively prohibits the provision of this necessary, safe, and effective care for many, if not most, transgender people in Missouri,” the petition says. The suit also seeks a stay on the rule’s expected Thursday start date and requests that the court award reasonable fees and expenses as well as any relief the court deems just and proper, the petition says. CNN has reached out to Bailey’s office for comment. The attorney general’s office said earlier Monday that the regulation “is based on dozens of scientific studies and reports, which are cited in endnotes.” An organization that focuses on issues in transgender health, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, and one of its affiliates, the United States Professional Association for Transgender Health, have said the rule is based in part on “flawed reports.” “The emergency regulation issued by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is based upon manipulated statistics, flawed reports, and incomplete data, and prevents the provision of medically necessary care,” the associations said last month, reacting to an earlier announcement from Bailey’s office about the forthcoming regulation. The petition filed Monday says transgender patients at Southampton Community Healthcare – one of the plaintiffs – “have expressed to its providers that they fear they will be denied continuation of their hormone therapy if they share symptoms of other mental health issues.” “Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s emergency order is a baseless and discriminatory attempt to limit the healthcare options for transgender individuals, who already face several barriers accessing necessary and life-saving medical care,” Southampton Community Healthcare’s Dr. Samuel Tochtrop said in a statement. “It’s our privilege as Southampton Community Healthcare to fight this rule on behalf of transgender Missourians.” The president and CEO of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD called the measure “an unprecedented attempt to restrict an entire group of people.” “The rule issued by Missouri’s attorney general includes outright lies and falsehoods about best practice care supported by every major medical association,” Sarah Kate Ellis said in a news release. “This is an unprecedented attempt to restrict an entire group of people from being able to make informed medical decisions in order to live and thrive.” “Health care decisions need to remain between patients, their doctors, and their loved ones – not subject to the whim of craven politicians looking to score political points,” Ellis said. “GLAAD is sending all of our support to our organizational partners and activists in Missouri, who are working hard to undo this unconstitutional directive as soon as possible. Transgender people belong, and this rule will not stand.” The action in Missouri comes after North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill this week banning gender-affirming care for most minors with the possibility of a felony for health care professionals who provide it. Indiana and Idaho enacted their own bans on gender-affirming care for youths this month, and several other states have signed into law restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors in the past few years.

      Officer who fired fatal shot in Breonna Taylor botched raid hired by a nearby county sheriffs office
    ","Myles Cosgrove, one of the Louisville Metro Police officers involved in the 2020 shooting of Breonna Taylor, has been recently hired by the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office, Cosgrove’s attorney told CNN. The move prompted the family of Breonna Taylor to release a statement expressing “disgust” and “disappointment” the officer who fired the fatal bullet in the botched raid was hired by a sheriff’s office only 50 miles away from Louisville. Cosgrove – the detective whose bullet ultimately killed Taylor according to the Kentucky Attorney General – began working for the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office on April 20, Sheriff Ryan Gosser told CNN affiliate WAVE. The sheriff told WAVE his office did a normal background check prior to hiring Cosgrove, and pointed out Cosgrove was never indicted. Gosser said Cosgrove brings experience which will be useful in the county, WAVE reported. Cosgrove’s attorney Scott Miller said his client was a scapegoat for the shooting death of Taylor. “He has been cleared by a state grand jury, a federal grand jury,” he said adding, “His actions that night, were what police officers are trained to react to when they’re fired upon,” Miller said. “We provided expert testimony that said he acquired sufficient target identification and target isolation. The city didn’t provide any expert testimony. They have nothing in their policy related to that.” Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said Cosgrove was justified because Taylor’s boyfriend fired at officers first. The Louisville Metro Police Department initially terminated Detective Cosgrove in January 2021 for use of deadly force for firing 16 rounds into Taylor’s home and failing to activate his body camera, according to a copy of his termination letter. In December 2021, the Louisville Metro Police Merit Board backed the decision to fire Cosgrove by a 5-2 vote, in a decision made after several days of hearings. Last November, the Kentucky Law Enforcement Council voted not to revoke Cosgrove’s state peace officer certification according to Louisville television station WHAS. The decision meant he could apply for other law enforcement jobs in the state. “The Kentucky law enforcement Council, consisting of citizens, mayors, Judge executives, police officers across the state as well as educators, also voted he should not lose his police officer certification [and] should be allowed to be a police officer in Kentucky,” Miller said. Sam Aguiar, who represents Taylor’s family, said he was “disgusted” when he heard about the hiring. “I was disappointed and disgusted to hear that an agency hired him. We had one of the best ballistics experts in the country review Cosgrove’s actions at length. He concluded without a doubt that Cosgrove shot Breonna continuously while she was unarmed, going to the ground, and on the ground,” Aguiar said. “Even if Carroll County was desperate for a body to fill a position, due diligence should’ve prevented this hire from happening. But we unfortunately know from Breonna’s case and so many others that in the world of policing, lots of undeserved favors are performed for officers simply because of the badge.” When reached, the Louisville Metro Police Department told CNN it had no comment. A protest was called in response to Cosgrove’s appointment outside the sheriff’s office in Carrollton, on Monday, the Carrollton Police Department confirmed to CNN. By midmorning, CNN affiliate WAVE reported, a small turnout of mostly Louisville residents. “We have activated our plans in regard to civil protests. Our agency has coordinated a response with other agencies that serve our city,” Carrollton Police Chief Michael Willhoite said in a statement to CNN. Carrollton Mayor Robb W. Adams addressed the controversial hiring on the city’s Facebook page. “As many of you may know, there has been some unrest in recent days related to a recent hiring at the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office. We do understand that there are groups who plan to come and exercise their right to assemble and peacefully protest this decision,” Adams said. “The City of Carrollton has been closely monitoring the situation and have plans in place to ensure everyone’s safety, although we do not expect any issues.” Meanwhile, Cosgrove, who has already started working for the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office, needs to work two more years to collect on his full retirement benefits, according to his lawyer. “He has a right to pursue a profession. And he’s pursued one for 20 years and done it honorably, up until this point when he was terminated by Louisville as a scapegoat for this entire situation,” Miller said.

      Former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter released from prison after serving time for deadly shooting of Daunte Wright
    ","Former Minnesota officer Kimberly Potter has been released from prison after serving 16 months of a two-year sentence in the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright, whom she shot after mistaking her gun for a Taser during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, according to the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Potter was released from the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Shakopee at 4 a.m. on Monday, the department said, noting the early hour was due to safety concerns and the potential for violent protests outside the facility. Potter was convicted of two counts of manslaughter in the killing of 20-year-old Wright, an unarmed Black man, during a 2021 traffic stop near Minneapolis. Wright was pulled over for having expired tags and for a hanging air freshener. Potter will be on supervised release for the remaining third of her sentence, in accordance with Minnesota law, which doesn’t provide time off for good behavior, the corrections department said. Potter’s supervised release expires in December. Potter’s attorney, Earl Gray, told CNN the former officer with 26 years of experience has no plans to return to Minnesota and will live in Wisconsin. Wright’s mother, Katie, said she was “dreading” Potter’s release and is struggling to find peace. She said she suffered a stroke that left her temporarily with blurred vision following the stress of Potter’s trial and conviction. “Some say I should forgive to be at peace but how can I? I am so angry. She is going to be able to watch her kids have kids and be able to touch them,” Katie Wright told CNN. “I am always scared I am going to forget my son’s voice. It gave us some sense of peace knowing she would not be able to hold her sons. She has two. I can’t hold my son.” She said Potter not being able to serve as a police officer again, due in part to her conviction, has given her “a sense of peace.” “She will never be able to hurt anybody as a police officer again,” Katie Wright said. “That is the only sense of peace we get as a family.” Potter wept when she testified during her 2021 trial, apologizing and insisting she “didn’t want to hurt anybody.” “I was very distraught. I just shot somebody. I’m sorry it happened,” Potter cried as a prosecutor asked her about her behavior moments after the fatal shooting. Potter testified she had been trained with a Taser since 2002 and testified she received a new model days before the April 11, 2021 shooting. The city of Brooklyn Center agreed to pay a $3.25 million settlement to the family of Daunte Wright in June 2022. The Wright family said the payment still has not been distributed due to other unrelated legal disputes but they are “hopeful” to receive payment in the next 90 days. Part of the settlement agreement requires Brooklyn Center Police officers undergo implicit bias training. The city’s newly elected mayor, April Graves, confirmed that training still hasn’t happened, though, she says, it’s in the works. Wright was killed just as the high-profile trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who was ultimately convicted of murdering George Floyd, was underway only about 10 miles away. Floyd’s death spurred outrage across the country with protests in many major cities – as well as some international locales – to decry police brutality and racial injustice. Soon after Wright’s death, the Brooklyn Center City Council approved “The Daunte Wright and Kobe Dimock-Heisler Community Safety and Violence Prevention Resolution,” which said the city would create an unarmed department to handle “all incidents where a city resident is primarily experiencing a medical, mental health, disability-related, or other behavioral or social need.” The resolution, which passed in 2021, was also named after Kobe Dimock-Heisler, a 21-year-old man living with autism, was also killed by Brooklyn Center Police after his family called 911 for help in 2019. The measure also said officers would not be able to make arrests or conduct searches for many lower-level offenses, including stops for non-moving traffic infractions. It was introduced by the city’s former mayor, Mike Elliott. “It was easy to get it passed but we still haven’t implemented anything and here we are two years later,” Katie Wright said. “It is roadblock after roadblock.” Mayor Graves told CNN the city is moving forward but “not as fast” as some in the community would like. She said the resolution “was crafted and written by the former mayor without the input of any staff or council members.” Graves, who was a city council member when the resolution passed in 2021, said the city council, which now has two new members since the killing of Wright, will vote on new recommendations for the policy changes in May. She added that last year the city held two town halls on policy recommendations. Another town hall was held Saturday. “There were some things within that resolution that just weren’t feasible,” Graves said, noting they only have about 35,000 residents and while they have “big city problems,” the council is working with a “small city budget.” “Creating three new departments was just not conceivable,” Graves added. “One of those departments that he called for was around a department of violence prevention or something along those lines. Our new office of community prevention, health and safety is aligned with those things.” Meanwhile, Graves said if the proposed traffic stop changes and consent searches are approved by the city council, officers would not be allowed to pull people over solely for minor traffic offenses, like invalid or expired registration, excessive window tints, and broken headlights or tail lights. She also said the current recommendations allow officers to pull someone over if a minor traffic offense could lead to serious damage. “I think if we’re able to actually vote on and approve these recommendations around consent searches and pre-emptive stops … it would bring down the likelihood of having these issues come up again,” Graves said, adding “community feedback is important.” In the last 18 months, Graves said the city has seen turnover in the police department and other city offices. The department, now led by its first Black chief, Kellace McDaniel, has 42 sworn police officers on patrol. Graves said the department is fully staffed at 49 officers. The city also “lost six out of seven department directors” but was able to rehire for those roles, including an equity and human resources director, Graves said. “When I first started, it was difficult to even have a resolution around racial equity but now, we have funding and staff trying to do that work internally and externally with the community,” Graves said. “I see definite changes. Government is slow. There’s definitely still a lot of obstacles, people’s fear and misunderstanding and, yes, bias getting in the way, but I think we have the right people in place to keep it moving forward.” Katie Wright and her husband, Aubrey, say they will continue to push for change. A red urn holding their son’s ashes sits above a fireplace in their living room. “Changing traffic stops is the only thing that is going to keep people safe. We need it in every city,” Katie Wright said. “I am not going to be quiet.” ",1210,us,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/us/kim-potter-release-prison-daunte-wright/index.html

      9 teens were injured when shots were fired at an after-prom party in Texas. Police say a second shooting may be connected
    ","At least nine teenagers suffered non-life-threatening injuries after shots were fired at an after-prom party in Texas over the weekend – and a second shooting less than 20 minutes away may be connected, authorities said. Deputies from the Jasper County, Texas, Sheriff’s Office responded to a disturbance at a home north of Jasper just after midnight on Sunday, the agency said in a Facebook post. Deputies found nine victims with non-life-threatening injuries, the post  said. The ages of the victims range from 15 to 19, sheriff’s office spokesperson Karli Cherry told CNN in an email Sunday morning. The violence is the latest in a relentless series of shootings in America, many of which have taken the lives of or seriously injured young people. Mass shootings have escalated, occurring at a record pace nationwide. At least 173 have been reported so far this year, leaving more than 225 people dead and at least 675 injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Last weekend, four young people were killed – including a beloved high school football player – and at least 32 others were hurt during a Sweet 16 birthday party in Dadeville, Alabama. The victims’ ages ranged from 17 to 23. At least six people – including four teenagers – have been arrested and face murder charges in the massacre, Alabama authorities have said. Following the Texas after-prom party shooting, at least eight victims were taken to a nearby hospital by personal cars and some victims were transferred to a hospital in Beaumont for further treatment, authorities said. While authorities have not yet identified a motive for the shooting, they are interviewing several witnesses and people of interest, the sheriff’s office said in a Sunday evening news release. The sheriff’s office said it is also investigating another shooting that occurred just miles away, adding there may be a “possible connection” between the two. Authorities did not offer further details about the second incident. Jasper is in eastern Texas, roughly 30 minutes west of the Texas-Louisiana border.

      5 things to know for April 24: Biden, Abortion, Sudan, NBCUniversal CEO, Ukraine
    ","An increasing number of iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting called the recovery key that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more. However, there are a handful of steps people can take to protect themselves from being permanently locked out of their Apple devices. Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can get “CNN’s 5 Things” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) President Joe Biden is preparing to formally announce his bid for a second term this week. Sources tell CNN that final edits have been made to an announcement video likely to be released Tuesday, marking four years since Biden declared himself a candidate in the 2020 presidential election. While Democratic lawmakers are poised to coalesce around his campaign, polls are showing tepid support among Americans for his reelection run. An NBC News poll released Sunday found just 26% of Americans think Biden, at 80, should run for a second term as president, while 70% say he should not. Among Democrats, 51% say Biden should not run for a second term. That mirrors the findings of other recent polls, including an AP-NORC poll released Friday and CNN polling released earlier this month. In the NBC poll, nearly half of those who oppose a Biden run cite his age is a major reason for that view. House Republicans are abandoning a yearslong push by their party to pass a federal abortion ban and are exploring other ways to advance their anti-abortion agenda — a remarkable shift that underscores how the GOP is wrestling with how to approach the topic ahead the 2024 presidential election. In interviews with dozens of Republicans, the vast majority — even among the staunchest opponents of abortion — rejected the idea of Congress pursuing a national ban and said leadership has no plans on the horizon for it to be a centerpiece of their agenda, despite passing federal restrictions on the procedure in previous years when they were in power. Instead, they argue that the question of whether to ban abortion is now best left to the states. After a week of heavy fighting in Sudan between rival military factions, the Biden administration moved to evacuate US government personnel from the region over the weekend. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that all US personnel and their families had been evacuated and that operations at the US embassy in Khartoum have been “temporarily suspended.” However, a State Department spokesman confirmed they do not “foresee coordinating a US government evacuation for our fellow citizens in Sudan at this time or in the coming days.” The State Department does not keep an official count of US citizens in foreign countries and Americans are not required to register when they go abroad. Officials last week said that there could be an estimated 16,000 American citizens in Sudan, most of whom are dual nationals. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell is stepping down after an outside investigation “into a complaint of inappropriate conduct,” its parent company Comcast announced Sunday. “I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret,” Shell said in a statement. “I’m truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege.” The brief statement did not specify who the woman was or include any other details about the investigation. Shell had been named CEO in January 2020 after leading content creation, programming and distribution for NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will chair a UN Security Council meeting today as tensions continue to rise between Russia and several UN countries over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia leads the council this month due to procedural rules, presiding over a body where members have slammed its war. This comes as Russia is also threatening to terminate the Black Sea grain deal, viewed as critical for solving the world hunger crisis, if Group of Seven nations ban exports to the country. In July 2022, Ukraine and Russia established the Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey aimed at guaranteeing safe passage for ships carrying grain and oilseeds —some of Ukraine’s most important exports.

      Start your week smart: Bed Bath & Beyond, abortion pill access, Sudan evacuations
    ","After one of the wettest winters on record, California’s hillsides are exploding with color. This stunning display of wildflowers is known as a superbloom, and it’s so big this year that it can be seen from space! Don’t believe us? See for yourself. Here’s what else you need to know to Start Your Week Smart. • Bed Bath & Beyond, the store for seemingly everything in your home during the 1990s and 2000s, filed for bankruptcy. The retailer attracted a broad range of customers by selling name brands at cut-rate prices. • The Supreme Court protected access to a widely used abortion drug by freezing lower-court rulings that placed restrictions on its usage. As a result, the FDA’s approval of mifepristone will remain in place while appeals play out. • US government personnel and their families have been evacuated from Sudan because of heavy fighting between rival military factions, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that operations at the US Embassy in Khartoum have been “temporarily suspended.” • The Biden administration plans to roll out aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants, sources told CNN, in a move that could face fierce legal challenges. • The Australian comedian Barry Humphries, best known for his drag character Dame Edna Everage, died at age 89. Humphries created the housewife character in 1955 as a social satire. Monday Jury selection is set to begin in the trial of the man accused of killing 11 people and wounding several others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on October 27, 2018. Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty on charges that include obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime. The mass shooting was the deadliest antisemitic attack in US history. Tuesday President Joe Biden is expected to formally announce his bid for a second term with the release of a campaign-style video that would coincide with the anniversary of his campaign announcement in 2019, according to sources familiar with the matter. Advisers inside and outside the White House caution that timing could still change, pending unforeseen events, but a decision has been reached that it is “no longer helpful or necessary to not just say the obvious: He’s running,” a senior Democratic official told CNN. The trial in a civil lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll against former President Donald Trump is expected to get underway in Manhattan. Carroll, a former magazine writer, alleges Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. She first sued Trump for defamation in 2019 after he denied the rape, said “she’s not my type” and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book. Trump denies all claims brought against him by Carroll. Last week, Trump’s attorney said the former president “wishes” to appear at the trial but that his attendance should not be necessary because it would be a “burden” on the city and court. Thursday Elizabeth Holmes, the former CEO and founder of failed blood-testing startup Theranos, is scheduled to report to prison to begin serving an 11-year sentence following her 2022 conviction on charges of defrauding investors. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos attracted top investors and retail partners with claims that it had developed technology to test for a wide range of conditions using just a few drops of blood. The company began to unravel after a Wall Street Journal investigation in 2015 reported that Theranos had only ever performed roughly a dozen of the hundreds of tests it offered using its proprietary technology, and with questionable accuracy. We will also get an initial reading on the health of the US economy in the first three months of the year when the Commerce Department releases its gross domestic product report for Q1.

      To my son, born in the climate crisis: I see signs of hope
    ","Dear River, You’ve only been around for three Earth Days, but your tiny lifetime has been a hell of a ride, kid. As a member of Generation Alpha (Good name! Hopeful.) I like to think you’ll read these letters with intent as you turn 30 in 2050. By then, you’ll know what became of the American experiment in the Age of Unreason and how fast the weather became unrecognizable. Since your last birthday, I watched the most expensive storm in Florida history upend lives down to the littlest, while out West, the hydrology has gone bonkers, with not enough water here and too much over there and no real plan on how to divvy it up among people who want lawns in the desert. While the American electricity made by clean sources surpassed coal-fired power for the first time, a Russian-led ground war in Europe set up a world where Saudi oil company Aramco made the second-highest annual profit in the history of humanity, just behind (checks notes) Saudi Aramco. If that’s not enough to make a new Old Dad stare in the middle distance, the nation of your birth has also been torn apart by $787,500,000 worth of lies without apology and conspiracy theories around every corner. The leading cause of childhood death is now a bullet – or usually several at once – and some nights, the only thought that brings me peace is that you are half-Canadian. But one thing I’ve learned as the first Chief Climate Correspondent on American television, when your beat is a “hyperobject” – a phenomenon so vast it exceeds human comprehension – one of the upsides is that you can choose to squint at it from an infinite number of angles on any given day. I spent the first couple years on this beat obsessing over the dark side of the human triptych in our real-life version of “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” while occasionally sneering at all the freaky human decadence causing our downfall in the middle – what Hieronymus Bosch called “Humankind Before the Flood.” But my mental health improved when I decided to spend more time between disasters over in the panel of goodness and light. One wild penguin colony or sustainable neighborhood at a time, I’m trying to balance out the firehose of peer-reviewed dread by focusing less on Life As We Blew It and more on Life As We Know It Could Be. Every week, I get pitched a world with airships hauling clean fuel instead of diesel tractor trailers, and sting ray-shaped robots that sink seaweed to bury carbon instead of factory-fishing trawlers that clear-cut the sea. Your buses could bring you to school on sunlight and then help power your classrooms after dark. The world’s most abundant fuel source might be hydrogen made from sun and sea water, or little nuclear fusion stars in boxes filling batteries made of salt or minerals mined on the Asteroid Psyche. All this utopian stuff is technically feasible but, as I learned filming “How To Unscrew A Planet” for CNN’s “The Whole Story,” they must also be scalable, affordable and profitable, which means our fates will be decided as much by marketers and influencers as policy makers and engineers. In a balloon over the Alps, legendary aeronaut Bertrand Piccard described how he found over 1,400 money-making, Earth-healing start-ups and tried to convince me that the answers are all around us, if only we can think like a balloonist and “change our altitude and attitude” by dropping the ballast of wasteful ideas and dirty fuels. But we still need dirty fuels to build all this new stuff and in your third year on Earth, we were just starting to wrap our heads around the trillion-ton problem of moving generations-worth of excess carbon out of sea and sky and back into the rock and seabed where it came from. “We have to build the oil industry in reverse!” Marty Odlin told me, sitting on a bucket on a dock in Maine as the fisherman/scientist gave me my metaphor for a show about planet-cooking CO2. “It’s a Godzilla,” he said. “It’s burning forests down. It’s stealing our fish. It’s devastating our crops. It’s hurting our farmers. All the stuff that’s free and fun is getting ruined. We should get mad and go kill that thing. Right?” Marty just wanted to be a fisherman growing up, but when he realized that the Gulf of Maine was too warm and acidic for his sons to ever consider the same, he started an ocean repair company to go hunting for Carbon Godzilla. Running Tide, which uses the natural carbon-sucking power of oysters and kelp, is among the finalists for the $100 million Carbon XPRIZE, funded by Elon Musk. Back when there were just a few Teslas on the road, I went to interview Musk in his modest garage headquarters on a side street in San Carlos, California, and I still remember the snap in my neck the first time I punched the Roadster’s pedal. But who could have known this guy would go on to launch his car into space for the LOLs, supplant GM and Toyota in profits and cause reputable news organizations to flee Twitter? Fifteen years later, I went back to that San Carlos street, and next door to Tesla’s old garage I met the founders of Ebb Carbon, another startup in the running for Musk’s $100 million Carbon XPRIZE. Their Model A is a machine that fixes the chemistry of water coming out of desalination plants, making the ocean less acidic while accelerating its ability to lock away carbon as bicarbonate. “That form of storage is stable for 10,000 years in the ocean,” Ebb’s CTO Matthew Eisamen told me. “And that’s a big reason for why we’re taking this approach is that’s basically the natural way the Earth regulates CO2.” They say their machine can capture 100 tons of Carbon Godzilla a year, at a current cost of over $1,000 a ton. “We need to get to billions of tons per year,” Eisamen said. “And we anticipate that this will, at scale, be one of the lowest cost approaches, much less than the magic $100 per ton.” But while Ebb just received $20 million in fresh investments, they are metaphorical toddlers at the starting line of a race to build a trillion dollar decarbonization industry in less time than it takes for an ice shelf collapse. And even if they somehow reach Tesla-like growth, science warns that the world will need hundreds of Ebbs to flourish in your lifetime to beat Carbon Godzilla. Which is why, in your third year on Earth, more people began talking in earnest about figuring out a way to turn down the sun. “We call it climate intervention,” Kelly Wanser told me as we sat under bluebird skies and the Washington Monument. Other people call it solar radiation management or geoengineering, and while the very idea touched off a fierce scientific debate, she left life as a systems expert in Silicon Valley to convince lawmakers and CEOs that humanity may be forced to mimic the cooling power of a volcano, so we should probably start studying the stratosphere now, just in case. Ever since the ash of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption blew into the stratosphere and cooled the planet by half a degree Celsius for more than a year, scientists have wondered if the effect could be duplicated by aircraft spraying enough sulfur dioxide or dust made of chalk or even diamonds to cool the Earth by a degree or two. At the University of Washington, they are trying to come up with an asthma inhaler the size of an airplane to mist seawater over land and sea to advance the field of marine cloud brightening. If properly scaled, the thinking goes that you could cool the Gulf of Mexico before hurricane season, or shade the Great Barrier Reef long enough to grow stronger coral. In the United Arab Emirates, they are even using drone-borne lasers to bring rain to the desert. But the reality is that we have no idea what works in the stratosphere, because we understand so little about the part of the sky twice as high up as our flights to Grandma’s. Chinese spy balloon scandals don’t help. “A lot more has been invested in the technology for helping determine like what shoes you want to buy than what the climate system is going to do,” Wanser said. In February, NOAA launched their first SABRE mission and sent pilots in space suits up to 60,000 feet above Alaska to take the first measurements of the stratosphere in decades. Their new tools will be a rare first glimpse into how the debris from wildfires, volcanoes and rocket exhaust is slowing, speeding or masking the rate of global warming. River, your great grandparents were alive from the Wright Brothers to the Space Shuttle, but as the Earth unravels and artificial intelligence rises faster than our imaginations, their 20th century rate of changes-per-lifetime will seem as quaint as the butter churn. So far, it feels like your future will be marked in new stories to frame our wants and needs, and new tools to build Life As We Know It Could Be. How it goes will depend on the wisdom and intent of the people wielding them, and how fast we grow or shrink Carbon Godzilla. Does this fill your Old Man with more wonder or worry? Depends on the day. ",1587,us,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/us/climate-crisis-earth-day-weir-letter/index.html

      Two Utah homes slide off cliff, prompting evacuation
    ","Two empty homes overlooking a canyon slid off their foundations Saturday in Draper, Utah, prompting the evacuations of two adjacent residences, officials said Saturday. In October, city building officials declared two clifftop homes “unfit for human habitation” due to “earth shifting that resulted in sliding and breaks in the homes’ foundations,” city officials said in a Facebook post. The city had been following up with the developer for months on engineering studies regarding the stability of the area, officials said. “With the snow pack melting and creating changes in conditions, other homes in the neighborhood will be evaluated for safety concerns,” said the Facebook post. “At this time, only the two adjacent homes are being evacuated.” Draper officials closed two public trails following the slide. “Everyone needs to avoid the area. Do not go to the neighborhood where the homes slid. Only residents allowed,” said city officials. “We are grateful that everyone is safe.” Draper is about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City.

      6 cows in Texas found dead and mutilated with their tongues cut out have left police searching for answers
    ","Six cows found dead and mutilated along a state highway in east-central Texas with their tongues “completely removed” have prompted an investigation by a county sheriff’s office, authorities said. Ranchers in Madison County first reported a 6-year-old longhorn-cross cow lying on her side, dead and mutilated, according to a release from the Madison County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday. The cow’s tongue was removed “with no blood spill” and a “straight, clean cut, with apparent precision” had been made to remove the hide around the cow’s mouth on one side, according to the sheriff’s office. While looking into the longhorn-cross’ death, investigators learned of five other cows that were also found in a similarly brutal condition. Each cow was from a different pasture and herd, and was found at a different location along the area of the state highway in nearby Brazos and Robertson counties, officials said. On two of the cows, a circular cut had also been made, removing the anus and the external genitalia. “This circular cut was made with the same precision as the cuts noted around the jaw lines of each cow,” the sheriff’s office noted. There were no signs of struggle or blood spill, and no footprints or tire tracks in the area around any of the cows, officials said. The sheriff’s office says it is coordinating with other law enforcement agencies for information, noting “multiple similar incidents” in the US. The cause of death of all six cows remains unknown, the sheriff’s office said, asking anyone with information to come forward.

      Brevard Zoo welcomes adorable, critically endangered grasshopper sparrow chicks
    ","Florida’s Brevard Zoo has welcomed a clutch of grasshopper sparrows, which the zoo said will help boost the species’ critically endangered population. The two sparrow chicks hatched on April 10 after incubating in their eggs for just 10 days, according to an email from the Brevard Zoo. The babies were born to parents Peg and Eddie, who were matched by a pair of “Florida grasshopper sparrow experts,” the zoo explained in a news release. The newborns will stay with their parents for around 21 days, then move to another behind-the-scenes habitat, where zoo staff will continue to monitor their health, the release said. Finally, they will be released into their native habitat in Central Florida to help bolster the bird’s tiny population. There were just over 100 grasshopper sparrows in their native range as of 2021, the zoo reported. The zoo released 43 captive-born sparrows into the wild last year. The birds, which reach around 5 inches in length as adults, are mainly threatened due to habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The sparrows traditionally make their homes in open prairies. But as prairies in central Florida have been converted to agricultural lands, the birds have lost crucial segments of habitat. Disease, limited genetic diversity, and nonnative fire ants which invade their nests have also contributed to the population decline, according to the zoo. The chicks have already received their first veterinary exam and been adorned with tiny colored bands on their legs, which will allow biologists to track and study them once they’re released, the zoo added. More adorable chicks might be coming soon: Three other pairs of Florida grasshopper sparrows at the zoo have also been matched and are at different stages of the nesting process, according to the release.

      NAACP files lawsuit after Mississippi governor signs legislation expanding state control over Jackson’s judicial system and policing
    ","The NAACP filed a lawsuit Friday to challenge new legislation signed by Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves that expands the state’s law enforcement reach in the city of Jackson and implements major changes to its judicial system. The laws signed Friday “represent a state takeover of Jackson” and strip residents of their right to democratically elect leaders, the NAACP said in a statement. One of the laws, SB 2343, will expand the state-controlled Capitol Police jurisdiction from its current boundaries around state buildings to a substantially larger portion of the city. The other, HB 1020, will establish a new court system within the boundaries of a state-created district. The legislation will strengthen public safety in Mississippi’s capital city amid a spike in crime, Reeves said in a statement, and Capitol Police officers will provide “additional bandwidth” for Jackson’s officers to patrol other parts of the city. “This legislation won’t solve the entire problem, but if we can stop one shooting, if we can respond to one more 911 call – then we’re one step closer to a better Jackson,” Reeves said. Critics have strongly opposed the two bills as they went through the state legislature, saying such changes would put mostly White, conservative state officials in control over much of a Democratic city where more than 80% of residents are Black. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has previously called the legislation to create an unelected court system “an attack on Black leadership.” NAACP officials say the state can instead do more elsewhere to alleviate problems in Jackson. “If elected officials in Mississippi want to help address the results of their negligence and improve the lives of Jackson residents, they should start with completing improvements to Jackson’s water system, not undermining the constitutional rights of their citizens,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement. The new court system established will be within the boundaries of a state-created district known as the Capitol Complex Improvement District – an area that includes the state Capitol building, downtown, Jackson State University, and nearby neighborhoods and businesses. That judge will be appointed, not elected, by the Republican state chief justice with prosecuting attorneys appointed by the Republican state attorney general to help with low-level cases. Republican lawmakers who pushed the legislation say it’s needed to address huge court backlogs and to stem violence that spiked in the city in recent years – much to the disagreement of the laws’ critics. The laws “represent a disturbing regression, rolling back decades of progress by stripping Jackson residents of their fundamental right to democratically elect leaders, undermining the authority of those they have elected, and severely restricting their first amendment right to freedom of speech,” said former US Attorney General Eric Holder, who is senior counsel at the law firm that filed the NAACP’s suit.

      Celebrity Cruises improperly stored dead body in cruise ship’s cooler, instead of morgue, lawsuit claims
    ","A Florida woman and her family have filed a lawsuit against Celebrity Cruises, claiming the cruise line improperly stored her husband’s body in the ship’s cooler, as opposed to the morgue, after he died on board. The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Wednesday. According to the complaint, Robert L. Jones, died due to a cardiac event while on the Celebrity Equinox cruise ship in August 2022, traveling from Fort Lauderdale to ports in the Eastern Caribbean. The lawsuit states that after Jones’ death, his wife, Marilyn Jones, was told that she had two options for what could be done with her husband’s body. According to the lawsuit, those options were to “either have Mr. Jones’ body removed from the ship in San Juan,” Puerto Rico or to “have his body stored on the ship until it reached port in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, approximately six days from the date of his passing.” Jones’ body stayed on board the ship for “approximately six days,” according to the lawsuit. “When the funeral services employee in Ft. Lauderdale was brought onto the ship to retrieve Mr. Jones’ body, his body was not located in the ship’s morgue,” the lawsuit said. “Instead, Mr. Jones’ body had, at some time not yet known, had been moved from the ship’s morgue to a cooler on a different floor than the ship’s morgue. The cooler in which Mr. Jones’ body was found by the funeral employee had drinks placed outside of the cooler, and was not at a temperature which was sufficient nor proper for storing a dead body to prevent decomposition,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also says the body was found “in a bag on a palette on the floor of the cooler” and that it “was in advanced stages of decomposition.” Marilyn Jones and her family are asking for compensatory damages in the amount of $1 million and are demanding a trial by jury. CNN has reached out to Celebrity Cruises for comment. ",339,us,2023-04-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/us/celebrity-cruises-dead-body-lawsuit/index.html

      China has an inflation problem. It’s way too low
    ","As much of the world fights desperately to bring down soaring prices that are slashing living standards, China is trying to do the opposite. Consumer prices rose by just 0.7% in March, compared with a year earlier. Factory gate prices fell for the six month in a row. In America, meanwhile, consumer price inflation was still 5% last month despite falling sharply; in the European Union it was 8.3% and in the United Kingdom 10.1%. Prices are stagnating or falling in China despite the fact that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been cutting interest rates and pumping cash into the financial system to bolster the economy, and despite the removal of strict Covid control measures late last year. Uncertainty over the economy means Chinese households continue to stash money into savings rather than going out to spend, and companies remain wary of making new investments. That’s raising the specter of a tailspin of falling prices and wages from which the economy may struggle to recover. “Our core view is that China’s economy is deflationary,” wrote Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, last week, soon after China released its first-quarter GDP growth figures. Although GDP expanded 4.5% in the first quarter, that growth largely reflected the impact of pent-up demand among shoppers following three years of pandemic restrictions, Yeung added. Stripping that out, GDP growth would have been only 2.6%. There’s plenty of money in the economy. The broad money supply, as measured by M2, increased by a record high of $5.6 trillion in the past 15 months. And the PBOC has been trying to encourage people to spend by boosting banking liquidity via multiple policy tools, such as open market operations and lowering reserve requirement ratios. But consumers appear to have barely reacted. Instead of spending money, people are hoarding cash at a record rate. Much of the new bank lending has gone to local governments, which were used to repay their high levels of debt, according to analysts. The unusual combination of price declines and unprecedented money supply in the economy has fueled talk of deflation. Deflation is defined as a sustained and broad decline in general price levels for goods and services over a period of time. It’s bad for the economy because, in such an environment, consumers and companies may put off spending in anticipation of prices falling further, which would only exacerbate economic problems. The problem plagued Japan’s stagnant economy for two decades, and its officials have only recently succeeded in starting to reverse the trend. “To describe China’s current economic situation in a word, deflation has begun, and the economy has fallen into recession territory,” said Liu Yuhui, a professor with a top government think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), during a recent speech that was widely circulated on social media. The pulse of the real economy is still “weak,” as real estate prices and financial assets “have not risen,” he added. Chinese households are heavily in debt and have no ability or willingness to spend, he said. Local governments, whose finances have been decimated by a combination of the real estate crash and the pandemic, are also acting like “zombies” because of their debt woes. “Due to the personal balance sheet issue … the willingness to use credit by various subjects in the entire economic system is rapidly collapsing,” Liu said. “The current China is the United States [of] 15 years ago, and Japan 30 years ago,” he added. Yu Yongding, a former director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the CASS, expressed a more cautious view. But he admitted that the economy was facing deflationary pressure. “In my opinion, although the statement ‘deflation has begun’ is not necessarily accurate, it is not a big mistake. Calling attention to deflation is entirely correct,” he wrote in an article posted last week on the Chinese news site Netease. “Insufficient aggregate demand is a prominent problem facing the economy.” A former central bank adviser, meanwhile, has urged Beijing to give cash handouts to consumers to stoke demand — a measure that was adopted by many major economies, such as the United States and Australia. But it has been rarely used by China’s central government. Li Daokui, a professor of economics at Tsinghua University who had served on the PBOC’s advisory committee, called on Beijing to hand out 500 billion yuan ($72.5 billion) in consumption vouchers to spur spending for the rest of this year. “Even with a conservative estimate, 500 billion yuan in consumption vouchers will drive one trillion yuan in overall consumption, ” Li said in a video posted on his Weibo social media account on Tuesday. In return, the government could receive at least 300 billion yuan through taxes generated by the increase in spending, he said “So it only takes 200 billion yuan in spending for the central government to drive one trillion yuan in consumption,” he said. “So why not do it? “ For its part, the PBOC has dismissed talk of deflation and defended its current policies. “There is no basis for long-term deflation or inflation,” said Zou Lan, an official with the PBOC, at a news conference in Beijing last Thursday. “As the financially supportive policies take effect, consumer demand is expected to warm up and price increases are likely to return to the average levels of previous years in the second half of this year,” he said.

      Wall Street Journal: Bud Light owner places two execs on leave after transgender influencer backlash
    ","Anheuser-Busch has placed two executives who managed Bud Light’s sponsorship of two Instagram posts from a transgender woman on leave, according to the Wall Street Journal and other media reports. Ad Age was the first to report that Alissa Heinerscheid, Bud Light’s vice president of marketing, was placed on leave. Todd Allen, most recently Budweiser’s vice president of global marketing, is set to replace her. Daniel Blake, Anheuser-Busch’s vice president who oversees market for mainstream brands, was also put on leave, according to the Wall Street Journal. Anheuser-Busch did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. The executive shakeup comes after Bud Light saw both support from trans activists and backlash from conservative media for its collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who has 1.8 million followers on Instagram and 10.8 million on TikTok. The beer maker sponsored two Instagram posts by Mulvaney and sent her a can of beer with her face on it. “Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics,” the brewery giant told CNN last week. “From time to time we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Dylan Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public.” A few days after the post was published, musician Kid Rock posted an Instagram video of himself shooting cases of Bud Light, and conservatives called for a boycott of the company. The online backlash ramped up to physical danger when Anheuser-Busch facilities received threats. The Los Angeles police department told CNN last week that it responded to a bomb threat and conducted a sweep of an Anheuser-Busch brewery in the Van Nuys neighborhood. Heinerscheid said in a recent Make Yourself at Home podcast interview that Bud Light needs to attract young drinkers to ensure the company’s future, with one avenue being to promote inclusivity. The company has a history of appealing to LGBTQ+ drinkers, releasing beer in rainbow bottles for Pride Month and partnering with LGBTQ+ support organizations. Heinerscheid was appointed to the marketing vice president position in June 2022, becoming the first woman in the brand’s 40 year history to occupy that role. The backlash against Bud Light and Mulvaney comes against a backdrop of legislation targeting transgender people and the growth of anti-trans rhetoric among conservative politicians. The House last Thursday passed a GOP-led bill banning transgender athletes from women’s and girls’ sports at federally funded schools and educational institutions. The bill is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate. Pushes for other anti-trans measures have ramped up in Republican-led states, such as bans on gender-affirming health care for transgender youth in Idaho and Indiana. More broadly, a record 417 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in state legislatures this year, according to American Civil Liberties Union data as of April 3. That’s more than twice the number of such bills introduced in 2022. It remains unclear whether Anheuser-Busch will see blows to its bottom line from the controversy, with experts expecting no sizable damage — but the company could have to answer questions about the matter when it reports first-quarter earnings on May 4.

      NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell fired after allegations of sexual harassment were corroborated, Comcast says
    ","Comcast said Monday it fired NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell after corroborating a female employee’s allegations of sexual harassment. An attorney representing CNBC anchor and senior international correspondent Hadley Gamble acknowledged Comcast investigated Shell because of her client’s complaint. CNN typically does not name victims of alleged sexual misconduct but is identifying Gamble because she gave her attorney permission to issue a statement on her behalf. “The investigation into Mr. Shell arose from a complaint by my client of sexual harassment and sex discrimination,” said Suzanne McKie, a managing partner of Farore Law, who is representing Gamble, in a statement to CNN. “Given these circumstances it is very disappointing that my client’s name has been released and her privacy violated.” Gamble provided emails which backed up her complaint, and NBC quickly hired outside legal counsel to investigate, according to multiple sources. After looking into the allegations, Comcast moved quickly to remove Shell, they said. Two sources familiar with the matter said Gamble had been informed the network was not renewing her contract, though it was unknown why it was not renewed. As of Monday afternoon, Gamble is still listed as a CNBC anchor on the channel’s official website. Shell’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Shell announced his surprising and immediate departure in a statement Sunday. “I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret,” Shell said in his statement. “I’m truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege.” Comcast declined to comment on the allegations from Gamble’s lawyer. But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Comcast said it fired Shell due to allegations of sexual harassment. “Following a complaint that Jeffrey Shell, CEO of NBCUniversal, engaged in inappropriate conduct with a female employee, including allegations of sexual harassment, Comcast Corporation retained outside counsel to investigate the allegations,” the filing said. “During the investigation, evidence was uncovered that corroborated the allegations. As a consequence, on April 23, 2023, the company terminated Mr. Shell’s employment with cause under his employment agreement, effective immediately.” Shell carried out his normal duties while the company engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation, a person familiar with the matter said. There is no search underway for a successor to Shell, the person added. In the meantime, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh will assume Shell’s duties. Shell had been named CEO in January 2020 after leading content creation, programming and distribution for NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment.

      Tucker Carlson out at Fox News
    ","Fox News and Tucker Carlson, the right-wing extremist who used his prime time perch at the talk network to exert a firm grip over the Republican Party, have severed ties, the network said in a stunning announcement that rocked the media and political worlds Monday. “We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,” Fox News said in a short statement that did not offer an explanation for his ouster, adding only that his last show was on Friday, April 21. Carlson, the highest-rated single host at Fox News, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The decision to part ways with Carlson was made Friday evening by Fox Corporation chief executive Lachlan Murdoch and Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, a person familiar with the matter said. Carlson was informed of the decision on Monday morning, a second person familiar with the matter said. The announcement came one week after Fox News settled a monster defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million over the network’s dissemination of election lies. The lawsuit had exposed Carlson disparaging colleagues. A lawsuit filed in March by his now-fired top booker, Abby Grossberg, also included a number of allegations of sexism on his show. During his time as a prime time host on Fox News, Carlson ascended to become one of the most influential figures inside the GOP. Republican lawmakers groveled at his feet and former President Donald Trump granted him the first interview earlier this month after his arraignment in New York. Carlson propelled himself to stardom in recent years by being a top promoter of conspiracy theories and radical rhetoric. Not only did he repeatedly sow doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 election, but he also promoted conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccines and elevated white nationalist talking points. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, praised Fox News’ decision, saying it is “about time” and that “for far too long,” Carlson has “used his primetime show to spew antisemitic, racist, xenophobic and anti-LGBTQ hate to millions.” Inside Fox News, some of Carlson’s internal critics rejoiced upon learning the news, people inside the network told CNN. There’s “a lot of relief generally, surprise they had the nerve to do it, and hope for a culture change,” one employee explained. It’s unlikely, however, that Fox News will stray too far from the right-wing talk that its loyal audience tunes in nightly for. The network said that, for now, Carlson’s 8 p.m. time slot will be filled by rotating hosts. Shares of Fox Corp. (FOXA) fell 5% on the news. The stock had been up slightly before the announcement. Carlson was a key figure in Dominion’s mammoth defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which the parties settled last week on the brink of trial for a historic $787 million. In some ways, Carlson played an outsized role in the litigation: Only one of the 20 allegedly defamatory Fox broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit came from Carlson’s top-rated show. But he was set to be one of Dominion’s first witnesses to testify at trial. And his private text messages, which became public as part of the suit, reverberated nationwide. Dominion got its hands on Carlson’s group chat with fellow Fox primetime stars Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and a trove of other messages from around the 2020 presidential election. These communications revealed that Carlson told confidants that he “passionately” hated former President Donald Trump and that Trump’s tenure in the White House was a “disaster.” He also used misogynistic terms to criticize pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and reject her conspiracies about the 2020 election – even as those wild theories got airtime on Fox News. Additionally, Carlson disparaged the right-wing network’s leaders in a series of text messages revealed in Dominion’s defamation case. In a text on Nov. 5, 2020 — two days after the 2020 election — Carlson wrote his producer Alex Pfeiffer: “We worked really hard to build what we have. Those f-ckers are destroying our credibility. It enrages me.” The pair appeared to be discussing the network’s coverage of the 2020 election, which had just recently — and correctly — called the critical state of Arizona for Joe Biden, enraging the network’s pro-Trump audience. Carlson later added on Nov. 6 to Pfeiffer: “A combination of incompetent liberals and top leadership with too much pride to back down is what’s happening.” Fox and other outlets projected that Biden would clinch the White House one day later. In a separate series of messages on Nov. 8, Carlson wrote: “Do the executives understand how much credibility and trust we’ve lost with our audience? We’re playing with fire, for real.” The lawsuit exposed how Carlson privately held a wholly different view than his on-air persona. A Dominion spokesperson did not comment on Carlson’s departure from Fox. In the two years since the attack on the US Capitol, the Fox primetime host used his huge platform to amplify paper-thin theories that the attack was a false-flag operation orchestrated by the FBI and government agents because they loathed Trump, and that the criminal rioters were themselves the victims. The baseless theory originated from a right-wing website, and Carlson catapulted it into the mainstream by repeatedly featuring it on his show. He routinely suggested that Capitol rioter and Trump supporter Ray Epps was actually an FBI provocateur who sparked the deadly riot. In a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday night, Epps had this to say about Carlson’s lies: “He’s obsessed with me. He’s going to any means possible to destroy my life and our lives.” An attorney for Epps sent a legal demand to Fox News in March demanding a retraction for “false and defamatory statements” made about his client. Carlson never apologized on-air. Carlson’s disinformation campaign about January 6 reached its apex just a few months ago, with an assist from the newly installed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican. The top-rated Fox host obtained and aired never-before-seen footage from Capitol security cameras, but the clips were cherry-picked and selectively edited. He said on his program that he ran the tapes by the US Capitol Police before airing the material, but they disputed his claim. Shares of Fox Corp.
            
                (FOXA) fell 5% on the news. The stock had been up slightly before the announcement. Grossberg, the ex-Fox News producer who has since disavowed the network, claimed in recent lawsuits that there was rampant sexism and misogyny among Tucker Carlson’s show team. Last month, she sued Fox News, Carlson, his executive producer Justin Wells and other figures, as well as Fox’s parent corporation. Grossberg, who joined Carlson’s team after the 2020 election, said in her lawsuit that after her first day on the job that “it became apparent how pervasive the misogyny and drive to embarrass and objectify women was among the male staff at TCT,” referring to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The lawsuits also claim that Grossberg alerted Wells to some of the “inappropriate and harassing conduct” that she endured while working at the show, but he “brushed aside” her concerns, according to court filings. Fox News is aggressively fighting two lawsuits from Grossberg. A Fox spokesperson previously said the lawsuits were “riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees.” In a lawsuit filed last month, Grossberg said Carlson “was very capable of using such disgusting language about women in the workplace.” She cited some of Carlson’s private texts to colleagues that were made public in the Dominion case, where he used the phrase “c-nt” to refer to Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, a top 2020 election denier. Her lawsuits also describe seeing sexually suggestive posters that were visible in the workplace, facing “uncomfortable sexual questions” from Wells about her former Fox News boss Maria Bartiromo, and witnessing internal debates on which women politicians were “more f–kable.” In a TV interview, she said the sexual harassment was so bad that she considered suicide. Wells was well-aware of the massive impact he and Carlson had on GOP politics, according to Grossberg’s lawsuit. She quoted a November 2022 editorial meeting where Wells allegedly said they had “the power to select the 2024 GOP presidential candidate” and a January meeting where he said Carlson planned to “save the Republican Party” by resolving the epic intraparty struggle over the House speakership. Carlson’s departure at Fox News comes after the network also severed ties with right-wing bomb thrower Dan Bongino, who had been a regular fixture on the network’s programming, in addition to hosting a weekend show. “Folks, regretfully, last week was my last show on Fox News on the Fox News Channel,” Bongino said on Rumble, chalking up the exit to a contract dispute. “So the show ending last week was tough. And I want you to know it’s not some big conspiracy. I promise you. There’s not, there’s no acrimony. This wasn’t some, like, WWE brawl that happened. We just couldn’t come to terms on an extension. And that’s really it.” Fox News responded in a statement, “We thank Dan for his contributions and wish him success in his future endeavors.” ",1526,media,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/media/tucker-carlson-fox-news/index.html

      How coupons backfired on Bed Bath & Beyond
    ","For decades, blue and white paper coupons defined Bed Bath & Beyond’s brand, popping up everywhere from the movie “Old School” to notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s junk drawer. But the iconic 20%-off coupons, which became known as Big Blue, ultimately contributed to the cornerstone retailer’s fall into bankruptcy. On Wednesday, Bed Bath & Beyond will stop honoring Big Blue coupons for good. Once a hugely popular marketing tool, the coupons backfired as the retailing business changed. They eroded Bed Bath & Beyond’s profit margins, hurt its brand image and trained customers to only shop at stores if they had a coupon stashed away. This made it much harder for Bed Bath & Beyond to sell merchandise at full price, as customers began to perceive Bed Bath & Beyond’s products as overpriced unless they had a coupon. That led to a perhaps inevitable bankruptcy. “It’s a very effective short-term strategy in terms of generating sales, but coupons are not good for long-term loyalty,” said Yuping Liu-Thompkins, a professor of marketing at Old Dominion University and director of the university’s Loyalty Sciences Lab on customer loyalty. Bed Bath & Beyond used coupons to draw shoppers into its maze-like stores. Once customers were inside, the company hoped they would wander around and impulse shop — buying linens, towels, pots and everything else that caught their eye. Redeeming coupons makes shoppers feel smart — like they’ve outfoxed a brand. One study found customers who received coupons released feel-good oxytocin hormones and their heart rates decreased. As online shopping grew, coupons became a less effective tool because customers could compare prices across different sites to find the lowest one. Rival stores also began to offer price-match guarantees. By then, Bed Bath & Beyond was hooked on coupons and couldn’t successfully pivot away. “They never grew out of their coupon strategy, which is sadly what led to their current situation,” said Liu-Thompkins. In the company’s early years – it dates to 1971 – coupons were infrequent, attached to circulars and for offers like $5 off a purchase of at least $15, according to a 2020 New York Times oral history of the coupons. Bed Bath & Beyond’s coupons took off during the 1990s. The company tried different colors like red and yellow, but they were too harsh. Instead, it went with Pantone 2735c. Soon, Bed Bath & Beyond was sending out nearly a billion coupons by mail a year, according to the Times. “We started to realize that what customers really wanted was the darn coupon. To hell with the rest of the stuff,” Rita Little, the company’s former vice president of marketing, told the Times. In the marketing business, sentiment was turning away from coupons. Critics say offering coupons is a waste of money that would be better directed toward dropping prices across the board or investing in improving products’ quality. Bed Bath & Beyond tried to move away from coupons during the 2010s after they squeezed profit margins. In 2016, Bed Bath & Beyond began testing a membership model that for $29 a year offered a 20% discount on all purchases and free shipping. But the membership never caught on. Customers were too attached to Bed Bath & Beyond’s coupons and resisted any changes to the model. Other chains, such as JCPenney, also tried to pull back on coupons and faced customer backlash. In 2020, Bed Bath & Beyond said it was scaling back its coupon program to boost its business. “We have an overreliance on the coupon,” one executive said at the time. But two years later, company executives called the move a “big mistake,” admitting they had misjudged how much shoppers had come to embrace the regular cadence of the Big Blue coupons. “The coupon was both its greatest strength and weakness,” said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst at UBS.

      Family of man shot and killed by US Park Police officers reaches $5 million settlement with US government
    ","The federal government has agreed to pay $5 million to the family of a man who died after he left the scene of a minor traffic accident and was shot in his vehicle by officers in Virginia in 2017, according to court documents. According to an amended complaint his family filed in US District Court, 25-year-old Bijan Ghaisar, who was unarmed, was shot by two officers of the United States Park Police, a unit of the National Park Service. Dashcam footage of the incident from a Fairfax County, Virginia, police officer, showed Ghaisar stopped twice during a vehicle pursuit before a third stop resulted in shots fired by officers. The US government has denied liability for the shooting, arguing in court documents that “as sad as this case is,” Ghaisar was not shot until “he drove his vehicle” at one of the officers involved, CNN previously reported. Ghaisar was taken to a hospital after being shot, where he spent 10 days in a coma before dying. The family of Ghaisar filed a civil lawsuit against the US government, claiming “wrongful death and the intentional infliction of emotional distress,” court documents show. Subsequent years of investigations following the shooting with few answers provided led the family to call on allies and supporters – including members of Congress – to demonstrate and help where possible. Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, among other elected officials, issued multiple joint statements calling on the Justice Department to reveal more information. “The Ghaisars deserve to understand what happened to Bijan,” the senators said in a 2019 statement after the Justice Department announced it would not criminally charge the officers. The officers were charged by prosecutors in Fairfax County in 2020 with involuntary manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm, but the charges were later ordered dismissed in federal court, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. The Virginia Attorney General’s Office declined to pursue the matter further in 2022. US District Judge Claude Hilton on Friday ordered that US “agents, servants, and employees” are released from liability claims regarding Ghaisar’s death “upon payment of the aforesaid settlement funds.” CNN has reached out to the United States Park Police and Thomas G. Connolly, attorney for Ghaisar’s estate, for comment. ",375,us,2023-04-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/us/bijan-ghaisar-shooting-family-settlement/index.html

Multiple shell casings were found at both scenes and police are asking for the community’s help in looking for a black sedan, “possibly a Mercedes,” that witnesses saw driving through the area, “indiscriminately” firing at people at the first shooting scene, police said. Authorities said they were still investigating what led to the second shooting. “We are investigating the scenes as being connected,” said Andre Wright, an assistant chief at the department. “It’s possible that they are not. However, given the locations, and the proximity of the event, I find it likely that the two scenes are connected.” Police are asking anyone with information to contact them.

      Kentucky law allows guns used in shootings to be auctioned. The family of the Louisville bank shooter wants to stop that
    ","The firearm a 25-year-old man used this month to shoot and kill five of his colleagues at a bank in Kentucky is expected at some point to go up for auction – a practice set by a state law the shooter’s family and Louisville’s mayor say they want changed. The statute, in place since 2016, states that certain confiscated guns not retained for official use “shall be sold at public auction,” with some proceeds going to public safety programs. The law governs the inevitable future of weapons that live on long after anyone they were used against might have perished. And in a nation where infamous shootings rack up by the week, it sets a clear process for the firearms’ fate – in contrast with other cases, like the five-figure donation that ensured the 2017 Las Vegas shooter’s arsenal would be destroyed or the controversial private auction for the gun used to kill Trayvon Martin in Florida. Still, the family of the Louisville gunman – who was shot dead by police responding to the attack – “was aghast to learn Kentucky law mandated the assault rifle used in the horrific event … be sold to the highest bidder at public auction,” they said in a statement. And despite the law, they’re taking steps to see that the AR-15-style rifle – the weapon of choice of many US mass shooters – is legally destroyed, they said. Meantime, Louisville’s Democratic mayor, a day after carnage unfolded during a staff meeting at the Old National Bank branch, also decried the gun-auction protocol – and called for it to change. “Think about that: that murder weapon will be back on the streets one day,” Craig Greenberg said at a news conference. “It’s time to change this law and let us destroy illegal guns and destroy the guns that have been used to kill our friends and kill our neighbors.” Just six days before the April 10 massacre in Louisville, Connor Sturgeon went to a local gun dealership and legally bought the AR-15-style rifle he’d use to slaughter his coworkers, police have said. This past Monday, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took possession of the assault rifle – the first step in ensuring its legal destruction – said Sturgeon’s family, adding it’s also working with the Louisville Metro Police Department to see the weapon is finished. “This tragedy is yet another indication that meaningful, common sense gun safety measures must be enacted,” the family said in its statement, adding, “We respectfully urge the Kentucky state legislature to lead the way by changing Kentucky law to remove the gun auction provision.” The call for change is not about politics but “life and death,” said Greenberg, who also demanded from federal and state lawmakers “the autonomy to deal with (Louisville’s) unique gun violence epidemic.” “The laws we have now are enabling violence and murder,” Greenberg said, slamming the state law that requires law enforcement to put seized firearms up for auction to federally licensed firearms dealers with an appropriate  license. “We have to take action now. We need short-term action to end this gun violence epidemic now so fewer people die on our streets and in our banks, in our schools,” the mayor said. “I don’t care about finger-pointing. I don’t care about blame. I don’t care about politics. I’m only interested in working together with our state legislators to take meaningful action to save lives to prevent more tragic injuries and more death.” Gun enthusiasts have described Kentucky as “one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi,” while gun violence prevention groups like Everytown for Gun Safety have billed its laws as “among the worst in the country.” Kentucky also is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. “Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there’s no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they’re ever used in a crime,” said CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit focused on gun violence. While the Louisville shooter’s rifle remains in limbo, the case recalls the fate of other weapons used or owned by notorious American gunmen – and the ethical questions that cropped up as what would happen to their firearms was considered. gAn anonymous donor in 2019 gave $62,500 to ensure guns owned by the man who shot and killed 58 concertgoers in 2017 in Las Vegas were destroyed, said Alice Denton, the attorney for the special administrator of gunman Stephen Paddock’s estate. The collection as a whole was appraised at about $62,300. “The question becomes: If we liquidate these guns and sell these guns, which is required as part of the special administrator’s duty, we will be perpetuating the violence that actually caused the death of those individuals?” Denton told CNN in 2019. All of Paddock’s property has since been sold and all of his guns destroyed or taken out of circulation by the FBI after a federal judge in 2022 ordered the agency to destroy the majority of the firearms, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Separately, the man acquitted of second-degree murder in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin auctioned the firearm he used to kill the 17-year-old. George Zimmerman got his Kel Tec 9 pistol back after he was cleared of the charge. Zimmerman auctioned what he called “a piece of American history” on the United Gun Group auction site, with a final bidder possibly offering $138,900 for the firearm, according to the auction host site. The 9mm pistol carried a suggested price of $356.36 on the manufacturer’s website. Whether the bid won is unclear, as two auctions ran simultaneously, one for pre-qualified bidders and one for the general public, according to United Gun Group.

      The more seriously wounded of 2 cheerleaders shot in a Texas parking lot is recovering from surgery, team official says
    ","The most seriously injured of two teenage cheerleaders shot in a Texas parking lot this week – an incident in which one said she’d opened the wrong vehicle door – is recovering from surgery as her team prepares to compete in a world championship without her, an official with her cheer company said. Payton Washington was shot in the leg and back during the early Tuesday attack in the city of Elgin, damaging her pancreas and diaphragm and requiring her to undergo surgery to remove her ruptured spleen, Lynne Shearer, managing partner of the Woodlands Elite cheer program, told CNN on Wednesday. A suspect is in custody, police have said. Washington’s cheer team is set to perform in a championship competition this weekend in Orlando, though the high school senior will not be able to compete, Shearer said. “The realization of the fact that she’s not going to be competing this weekend – it was starting to set in,” she told CNN. Washington, according to her team, was one of two teens police say were shot early Tuesday in the parking lot of an H-E-B supermarket in Elgin. The incident was at least the fourth this week in which young people were shot during an apparently safe, ordinary encounter, including a 6-year-old and her dad wounded over a reportedly errant basketball in North Carolina, a 16-year-old struck in the head after ringing a doorbell in Kansas City, and a 20-year-old killed allegedly by the owner of a home whose driveway she’d inadvertently turned into. The other Texas cheerleader – Washington’s cheer teammate Heather Roth – had gotten out of a friend’s car in the parking lot and opened the driver’s side door of a car she thought was hers, only to find a stranger sitting in the passenger seat, Roth told according to CNN affiliate KTRK. As she tried to apologize to the man, he got out of the car and began shooting, Roth said during a prayer vigil Tuesday night, according to the affiliate. A witness told CNN on Thursday the suspect fired three to four shots as they drove away. The man – who asked not to be named due to safety concerns – said he was sitting in his car and was on the phone talking to his family abroad at about midnight on Monday when he saw car lights turn on about 100 feet in front of him and then heard gunshots. He remembers seeing the suspect standing outside the vehicle and firing his gun as the cheerleaders drove out of the parking lot. “After that, [the suspect] also started following them by starting his car and follow[ing] their car,” the witness said. The witness said he didn’t see the interaction between the cheerleaders and the suspect before the gunfire. He didn’t call 911 because someone said they had already been alerted to the shooting, said the man, who works in the area. The first officer arrived in less than two minutes, he added. Roth, who was also shot, was treated and released at the scene, Shearer said. Two other cheerleaders who were present have not been reported injured. “So incredibly grateful for the love and support we have received the last couple days. its not been easy but we will come out the other side stronger than ever. everything we do is for you P,” Roth wrote in an Instagram post Thursday. Washington was stable in an intensive care unit as of Tuesday, according to a GoFundMe page set up by her team, the Woodlands Elite Generals. Washington’s stomach had still not been closed up as doctors were giving her heavy antibiotics and waiting to be sure she would not get an infection, Shearer said Wednesday. Police used witness accounts and surveillance footage to find a suspect in the shooting, 25-year-old Pedro Tello Rodriguez Jr., according to a police affidavit. A supermarket manager witnessed the incident, and police have surveillance footage from the parking lot that shows the license plate on the suspect’s car, police said, according to a probable cause affidavit. When detectives arrived at Tello’s home, Pedro’s brother told them “he was home asleep, and his brother Pedro drives the NIssan which was parked in the front yard,” according to the affidavit. Pedro was supposed to be at work at H-E-B, he told detectives, the document says. He was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of deadly conduct with a firearm, a third-degree felony, according to a probable cause document, and held on a $500,000 bond. It was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney. The shooting stunned the cheer team just days before they are set to compete in the Allstar World Championship in Orlando this weekend. Roth is expected to compete, but Washington has had to come to terms with the fact that she won’t be able to go with the team, Shearer said. “So (Washington) was extremely, you know, up and down with her emotions. But she was talking and for the most part doing well,” Shearer said. Washington “has surpassed many obstacles to rise to the very top of her sport,” Shearer said, including being born with only one lung. She had committed to Baylor University’s Acrobatics and Tumbling team. That team’s coach visited Tuesday with Washington, who was making good progress, though her path to recovery had only just begun, the acrobatics team head coach Felecia Mulkey told CNN. “Payton is a strong young lady; if you know her, you know that about her,” Mulkey said. “I have no doubt she’s going to get through this.” Washington is an “amazing athlete but a better human,” Mulkey said. Roth, who is in college, and Washington are from the Austin and Round Rock area and were commuting in a three-times-a-week carpool to a cheerleading gym in the Houston suburb of Oak Ridge North. Washington has been making the approximately 300-mile round trip commute for eight years, Shearer said.

      Disney employee accused of taking videos up park guests’ dresses and skirts for years is fired and arrested
    ","A former Disney World theme park employee was arrested and charged in Florida after allegedly recording a video up the skirt of a park guest late last month – and may have been similarly attacking other visitors for years, according to an arrest affidavit. Authorities responded to Disney’s Hollywood Studios on March 31 after an employee was witnessed recording an “up-skirt” video of a female guest at the “Star Wars” retail store, according to the affidavit from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. Then-employee Jorge Diaz Vega, 26, allegedly told authorities in an interview that he had “been taking videos up the dresses/skirts of unknown females in the Disney World theme parks for approximately six years,” according to the affidavit. Diaz Vega, who worked at the lightsaber store, told authorities he had what he estimated to be over 500 such videos on his phone and showed “multiple examples of the videos” to detectives, according to the affidavit. “The videos were of multiple females who all appeared to not know they were being video recorded,” the affidavit states. During his interview, Diaz Vega told detectives he took the videos “because it is hard to find them online, and they bring him sexual gratification.” An 18-year-old woman who was an alleged victim of one of the videos taken on March 31 was told by a security officer later that day that someone had been caught taking an image under her dress at the lightsaber shop, according to the document. She “was not aware at the time the incident took place, and she was not told of the identity of the male,” authorities say in the affidavit. When CNN reached out to Disney for comment and to verify employment dates for Diaz Vega, a spokesperson told CNN, “The individual does not work for the company.” Diaz Vega was arrested on March 31 on suspicion of video voyeurism and had a bond of $2,500 set for him. He has been released from Orange County Jail, records show. CNN has attempted to reach Diaz Vega directly for comment. He does not currently have an attorney listed.

      DoorDash driver in Tampa is kidnapped and sexually battered by a man before she is rescued by family members, police say
    ","A woman delivering for DoorDash in Florida was attacked and kidnapped before being rescued by her family members, police say, and a male suspect has been arrested. The driver was trying to make a delivery to the Residence Inn in Tampa at night on April 18 when she was approached by an armed man – identified as 38-year-old Joseph Killins – who forced her back into her car at gunpoint and made her drive to another location more than 6 miles away, where he sexually battered her, the Tampa Police Department said in a news release. When the man first confronted the delivery driver, the victim had her AirPods in her ears and was on the phone with her girlfriend, who realized a robbery was taking place, police said in their initial news release. Family members then called police, and officers were dispatched to the hotel. The victim’s family, who had been tracking her phone, arrived at her location and rescued her from the car, authorities said. The suspect “responded by firing multiple times, with one shot striking a family member of the victim’s girlfriend, a female in her 20s, before fleeing the scene,” Tampa police said in a news release. Both victims were taken to a nearby hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. The next morning, Killins allegedly threw a woman to the ground at an apartment complex, punched her and stole her backpack, according to Tampa police. Detectives investigating the alleged robbery were led to Killins’ location at the Tampa Inn and “items related to the April 18 investigation were recovered,” police said. Killins was then arrested late Friday night and charged with the DoorDash delivery driver’s kidnapping and battery, among others. “This criminal is now off the streets thanks to the tireless efforts of every Tampa Police Department employee and the assistance provided by members of our community,” Interim Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw said. “My thoughts remain with the victims. I hope this arrest brings them a sense of comfort knowing that he will now face justice for the crimes he chose to commit.” Killins was charged with armed kidnapping, robbery with a firearm, armed sexual battery and aggravated battery with a weapon in the April 18 incident, authorities said. He also faces another robbery charge for the April 19 incident, according to police. “We are appalled by this heinous and abhorrent crime,” DoorDash spokesperson Julian Crowley said in a statement. “No one should ever have to endure something as horrific as this and we’re here to support the Dasher in any way we can. We’re grateful to Tampa Police for their work to hold the perpetrator accountable and we strongly hope justice is served.” ",452,us,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/us/tampa-doordash-driver-kidnapped-sexually-battered/index.html

      New York lawmakers push for lithium-ion battery safety regulations after a string of fires
    ","A group of New York Democrats announced support for federal legislation aimed at regulating lithium-ion battery safety standards after a spate of fires caused by the batteries malfunctioning or overheating. Lithium-ion batteries, found in many popular consumer products like e-scooters and smartphones, have been under scrutiny amid increasing reports of explosive fires triggered by the batteries, which use flammable materials. Support in New York for more safeguards comes after at least seven people were injured when a lithium-ion battery-powered scooter exploded in the Bronx early last month. The incident followed a Manhattan apartment building fire in November that injured at least 38 people and was blamed on a lithium-ion battery connected to a micromobility device. The “Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act,” introduced in the US House of Representatives in late March, sets federal safety standards for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used to power electric scooters and e-bikes and sets guidelines to protect consumers against the risk of fires caused by such batteries, according to the bill. “Without federal legislation, and so many of these batteries come from across state lines or made overseas or made in China, we will not have a complete and strong solution,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. Fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand agreed, saying, “We cannot allow for faulty or improperly manufactured batteries to keep causing these dangerous, deadly fires.” New York City has seen 63 fires and 5 deaths caused by lithium-ion batteries this year alone, Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said during the news conference. The new lithium-ion battery safety bill was announced last month by Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-NY, who said the legislation would save lives and protect property. Torres said the latest fire is another reminder “of the escalating threat lithium-ion batteries poses to the public’s safety,” according to a news release. Two lithium-ion battery related deaths were reported two weeks ago in Queens, where an e-bike caught fire in a vestibule of a building and flames exploded to an upper level, blocking the exit, officials said. New York City Fire Department Chief Fire Marshal Dan Flynn said the incident in Queens was the 59th lithium-ion battery related fire the agency had battled, according to an Instagram post from the FDNY. The fire department advised residents to buy UL-certified devices, keep devices at room temperature and keep them away from direct sunlight, among other tips.

      New Jersey residents warned of potentially hazardous chemicals following fire and cleanup at former industrial site
    ","Residents and business owners in parts of Monmouth County, New Jersey, have been warned of potentially hazardous materials at a nearby former industrial site after firefighters found leaking containers and materials on fire at the location. The US Environmental Protection Agency has started overseeing the sampling and removal of around 200 to 300 chemical drums and containers found at the former manufacturing facility in Howell Township, it said in an April community update. It is not yet clear what type of chemicals the drums and containers hold, the EPA said. EPA spokesperson Stephen McBay told CNN Sunday there is “no immediate need for evacuations” as the agency actively conducts cleanup at the site. The cleanup comes after a local fire department discovered materials burning inside an old metal structure at the site on February 9, the EPA said. Firefighters found numerous drums and smelled a chemical odor before putting out the fire and called in other agencies for support in addressing potentially hazardous materials. In March, the EPA said the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection assessed the site and found roughly “200 to 300 55-gallon drums and containers, many of which were either bulging, rusting, denting, or leaking.” The department then asked for assistance from the EPA, which said it found “breaches in the front fence of the property and no fence securing any other side of the property.” The EPA also observed containers that were leaking and labeled as hazardous materials, it said. The site is the former location of Compounders Inc., which manufactured chemical compounds, including glues, adhesives, and asphalt materials, according to the EPA. Compounders operated until 2019. The current owner – who has not been publicly identified – purchased the business in 2021. When asked by CNN if criminal charges are pending over the disposal of potentially hazardous material at the site, the EPA’s McBay said the agency “does not provide information on ongoing or potentially ongoing enforcement actions.” Resident and business owners within a mile of the site were sent a letter on March 30 from the Howell Township Office of Emergency Management, warning of potential hazardous materials at the site. In addition to the large number of drums found, the letter said authorities also found “spilled materials on the ground and open drums, as well as solid waste.” The letter included links to Howell Township’s website, with community updates on the EPA’s work at the site. On March 9, advice was posted for evacuation routes around the 15 Marl Road site to be used in case of an emergency event, such as a fire. Residents at a community meeting on March 21 were told the evacuation plan was created “out of an abundance of caution.” There are at least three schools and two child care centers in the area, according to an April community update. The letter from the township’s Office of Emergency Management added, “We estimate the risk of a release of any potential hazardous material to be very low. After all drums are removed from the property, an investigation will be ongoing with the State NJDEP and EPA to determine what, if any, impacts have occurred to groundwater, soil or surface water.” The EPA has placed 24/7 security on the property and said it has installed a perimeter fence “to ensure there is no illegal trespassing on or around the site.” ",560,us,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/us/new-jersey-former-industrial-site-hazardous-chemicals/index.html

      Fighting between Sudan military rivals enters a second day, with dozens dead
    ","Fierce fighting across Sudan entered a second day as months of tensions between a paramilitary group and the country’s army erupted into violence. Clashes around the army headquarters and presidential palace in capital Khartoum involved heavy weapons. There have also been reports of battles hundreds of miles away in the eastern city of Port Sudan and in the western Darfur region. At least 56 people have been killed and nearly 600 injured in the clashes, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors. “Since yesterday we have not been able to leave the hospital for our homes because the clashes are taking place near the hospital and armed men from the army are roaming inside the hospital with their weapons,” a female doctor in Khartoum told CNN. “We are in a real state of terror with the sound of explosions and bullets, we escaped death many times,” she added. Sudan’s paramilitary chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo claimed to have seized most of Khartoum’s official sites after clashes erupted between his armed group and the country’s military on Saturday. On Sunday, Dagalo’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) released a video declaring it had gained control of the Meroe airport in the north of the country. Dagalo told CNN the RSF is in control of the presidential palace, Khartoum airport and the General Command headquarters. The country’s military leader, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, disputed Dagalo’s claims on Saturday and said the military has maintained control over government sites. CNN has been unable to independently verify either side’s claims. As fighting continues in Khartoum and other parts of Sudan, the World Health Organization is urging all parties to the conflict to respect the neutrality of health care and ensure unrestricted access to health facilities for those injured by the hostilities. More than 83 people have been killed and at least 1,126 injured since April 13 “across Khartoum, South Kordofan, North Darfur, Northern State and other regions,” the organization said, noting the “heaviest concentration of fighting” is now in Khartoum City. “There are also reports of shortages of specialized medical personnel, including anesthesiologists,” the WHO said in a statement Sunday. “Water and power cuts are affecting the functionality of health facilities, and shortages of fuel for hospital generators are also being reported.” In an interview with Al Jazeera, Dagalo – also known as Hemedti – described Burhan as a “criminal,” accusing him of instigating the fighting. “It was not us who did this,” Dagalo told CNN’s Larry Madowo. “We were defending ourselves. We’re sorry and we tell the Sudanese people that this crisis will end, and Sudan will be even better than before. And this will be a lesson to learn in the future.” Dagalo accused the Sudanese army of breaking a United Nations-brokered temporary humanitarian ceasefire Sunday evening. “We’re under attack from all directions,” Dagalo said. “We stopped fighting and the other side did not, which put us in a predicament, and we had to keep fighting to defend ourselves,” he claimed. Dagalo also speculated that Burhan has lost control of his military, saying “they don’t seem to be listening to him.” Dagalo’s rise to power began when he was a leader of Sudan’s notorious Janjaweed forces, implicated in human rights violations in the Darfur conflict of the early 2000s. His group killed at least 118 people in pro-democracy protests in June 2019 after troops opened fire at a peaceful sit-in. He and Burhan were pivotal in the 2019 overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir but have since become locked in a power struggle, with tensions over the RSF’s integration into the army. There have been widespread calls for calm. Sudan’s former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok on Sunday warned of civil war and called for immediate negotiations. “This war has to stop today … peace is the only option to avoid slipping into a civil war,” he said at a news conference in Abu Dhabi. The US and UN also called for an end to the fighting. African leaders were holding emergency meetings on Sunday in response to the situation. Sudan’s neighbors Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate. The UN’s political mission in Sudan has said the country’s two warring factions have agreed to a “proposal” although it is not yet clear what that entails. The military has been in charge of Sudan since a coup in 2021, with Burhan and Dagalo at the helm. The 2021 coup ended a power-sharing arrangement, following the 2019 ouster of al-Bashir. A CNN investigation also uncovered another link between the two men: their involvement in Russia’s exploitation of Sudan’s gold resources to fund its Ukraine war, with Dagalo’s forces also being key recipients of Russian training and weaponry. But recent talks have led to cracks in the alliance between the two military leaders. The negotiations have sought to integrate the Rapid Support Forces into the country’s military, as part of the effort to transition to civilian rule. Sources in Sudan’s civilian movement and Sudanese military sources told CNN the main points of contention included the timeline for the merger of the forces, the status given to RSF officers in the future hierarchy, and whether RSF forces should be under the command of the army chief, rather than Sudan’s commander-in-chief, who is currently Burhan. The hostilities, sources told CNN, are the culmination of what both parties view as an existential fight for dominance, one with Burhan, they said, seeking support from Sudan’s former Islamist rulers, resurrecting the specter of days many Sudanese fought to leave behind. Dagalo told CNN he had no intention to rule Sudan. “There should be a civilian government. This has always been my stance,” he said.

      The convicted murderer suspected of faking his own death in a South African prison fire
    ","If this were the plot of a movie, it would be too far-fetched to be believable. South African authorities have taken over management of a maximum-security prison run by a private British security firm after a high-profile convicted murderer was accused of faking his own death in a fire, then escaping the prison to live in the open with his celebrity doctor girlfriend. Thabo Bester was deported to South Africa by Tanzanian authorities on Thursday after being arrested in the border town of Arusha, having apparently fled the country, according to a media briefing by the South African Justice Minister and Minister of Police. This comes as media reports raised questions about the prison fire where he was said to have died. It’s a bizarre story that has embarrassed South Africa, exposed alleged loopholes in the management of a private prison and captivated the nation with every blockbuster revelation. The 35-year-old convicted murderer was arrested with his girlfriend Dr. Nandipha Magudumana and a Mozambican national named as Zakaria Alberto on Friday. South African police minister Bheki Cele told reporters that the trio had several passports each that had not been stamped and were just 10 kilometers from crossing into Kenya. Bester was sent to the Kgosi Mampuru Central Maximum prison in Pretoria where he will be closely watched. “We are placing a 24-7 surveillance on him. We’re also placing a 24-7 contact with him with selected highly trained Correctional Services officials to ensure that whatever circumstances he finds himself in, we’ll be on call, and we do not experience any security breach,” South Africa’s Department of Correctional Services (DCS) boss Makgothi Thobakgale told reporters in Cape Town. Magudumana was also deported to Tanzania and named as an accomplice. She was arrested pending a court appearance on Thursday, according to the Police, and will be charged with murder, fraud as well as aiding and abetting his escape. Magudumana’s 65-year-old father Zolile Cornelius Sekeleni and a former prison warden, Senohe Ishmael Matsoara, 38, were also arrested and accused of being accomplices in Bester’s escape. The two men were charged with “defeating the ends of justice, fraud, murder, and arson,” in a Bloemfontein court on Tuesday. They did not enter a plea and have no lawyers on record. A judge ordered them to remain in custody until their next court date on April 17. Bester was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the rape and murder of model Nomfundo Tyhulu. A court had previously found him guilty of the rape and robbery of two other women he lured to his home on social media, with local media dubbing him “the Facebook rapist.” He was initially reported to have died in a fire at the prison last May. But in November, the official position by South African prison authorities that Bester had been found dead in his cell began to unravel after local investigative outlet GroundUp’s reporting raised doubts. Authorities later concluded that the burned body found in his cell was not Bester, and the person had died before the fire began. “A case of murder is under investigation following the outcome of the DNA analysis that confirmed that the body of the deceased which was found [in the cell], was not of Thabo Bester,” police and the Justice & Correctional Services ministry said in a joint statement on Saturday. “The autopsy report went on to further reveal that the deceased had died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, and was already dead, prior to the arson incident,” it added. The DCS last month said Bester appeared to have walked out of the facility in “a well calculated and organised escape debacle.” It temporarily took over the management of the prison from the British company G4S, and suspended three of its own officials. “Greatly worrying is the fact that a private vehicle was allowed inside the facility without a gate pass on the day of the escape, possibly carrying an unknown body that was burnt beyond recognition in cell 35. This talks to a facility that has compromised its security system beyond any reasonable doubt,” the DCS said in a statement last month. Three G4S officials were pressed by lawmakers on Wednesday to explain how Bester escaped from a maximum security prison they had described as “one of the most secure in South Africa.” Though they deny any wrongdoing, they say three employees who were on duty have been dismissed and seven more remain suspended. A 22-page report presented alongside the G4S officials’ appearance before the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services said an unauthorized phone and laptop were recovered in Bester’s cell after the fire. Bester’s application to be moved to solitary confinement because “his life was in danger” had been approved just three days before he escaped, they said. But many lawmakers were not satisfied, accusing the firm of dishonesty and failing to take responsibility for the prison break. “You are a private company in a private public partnership with the state that is dishonest that came and deliberately misled the people’s parliament. What would be your reaction to that?” asked ruling party MP Xola Ngola. “I would disagree with that,” responded Cobus Groenewoud, a director at G4S. “We have tabled to the committee all the facts available to us.” They told the committee that there was no security camera footage of the cell on the night of Bester’s escape due to a power failure. They admitted in questioning that the cell is located near an emergency exit and did not rule out staff collusion in the prison break. Bester’s girlfriend Magudumana is a prominent medical doctor and entrepreneur, with more than 100,000 followers on social media where she posted glamorous pictures, promoted her media appearances, and boasted of awards such as the Mail & Guardian’s 200 Young South Africans of 2018. Andre Snyman, a crime analyst who founded the South African community crime network eblockwatch and describes himself as “the agony aunty of crime in South Africa,” told CNN that he met Bester several years ago and described him as charismatic. “He was an incredibly neat, well-groomed, well-spoken and well-dressed man.” He doesn’t expect Bester to escape a second time though. “He’s South Africa’s Houdini but I don’t think he’ll get out again.” ",1049,africa,2023-04-12,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/africa/south-africa-murderer-fakes-own-death-intl/index.html

      Egyptian official rejects leaked intelligence suggesting nation’s military was producing weapons for Russia
    ","A senior Egyptian official denied that the country’s military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia, following reporting by the Washington Post citing a leaked US intelligence document, Egyptian state-affiliated media said. A leaked US intelligence document obtained by the Washington Post said Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret “to avoid problems with the West.” The February-dated “top secret document” purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials referencing plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, and to keep the plans a secret, the Washington Post said. CNN has not seen the document cited by the Washington Post and is unable to confirm its authenticity. The Egyptian official, unnamed by state-affiliated media, called the Washington Post report “informational absurdity” and said that Egypt follows a “balanced policy” with all international parties, Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet said. The statement was carried by several Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Egypt is one of the world’s top recipients of US military aid, receiving $1.3 billion in military financing annually. The White House also said it has no indication Egypt is providing Russia with deadly arms. John Kirby, a spokesman for the US National Security Council, told reporters aboard Air Force One “we’ve seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal weaponry capabilities to Russia.” Kirby said Egypt remained “a significant security partner” and would remain so. “The United States military has a longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many years,” he said. Russia’s Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the information “another hoax.” “It looks like another hoax, of which there are plenty now. This is how you should treat such publications,” Peskov said in response to a question from a reporter on the report. CNN reached out to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry for comment. Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff’s intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. Egypt has publicly voiced muted opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has supported United Nations resolutions condemning the war, including a call in February that Moscow “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine and called for a cessation of hostilities.” The country’s economy has been damaged by the conflict, with Egypt relying heavily on grain exports from the two countries.

      At least 44 killed in Burkina Faso attacks
    ","At least 44 civilians were killed in two separate attacks on villages in northern Burkina Faso, authorities there said. A local governor, Rodolphe Sorgho, blamed terrorists for the “despicable and barbaric” attacks, without naming a specific group. In a statement Sorgho gave his “sincere condolences to the grieving families and wishes a rapid recovery to the wounded.” Few other details were available about the incidents, but a resident of one of the villages told AFP “a large number of terrorists” attacked late on Thursday, with gunfire sounding throughout the night. Burkina Faso is one of the world’s poorest counties and has become the epicenter of violence carried out by Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The violence began in neighboring Mali in 2012 but has since spread across the arid expanse of the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert. Large areas of the north and east of Burkina Faso have become ungovernable since 2018. Millions have fled their homes, fearing further raids by gunmen who frequently descend on rural communities on motorbikes. Thousands have been killed.

      Oscar Pistorius Fast Facts
    ","Here is a look at the life of Oscar Pistorius, double-amputee and former Olympic sprinter convicted in the shooting death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Birth date: November 22, 1986 Birth place: Johannesburg, South Africa Birth name: Oscar Leonard Carl Pistorius Father: Henke Pistorius Mother: Sheila Pistorius Education: Attended the University of Pretoria Born without fibulas in either leg, doctors amputated both his legs below the knee at 11 months of age. Grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. Nicknamed “Blade Runner” and “the fastest man on no legs” because of the carbon-fiber prosthetic blades he wears to run track. Winner of six gold, one silver and one bronze Paralympic medals. First double-amputee athlete to compete against able-bodied runners in the Olympics. 1987-1988 - Both legs are amputated below the knee and Pistorius is fitted with his first prosthetics. June 21, 2003 - Sustains a knee injury while playing rugby in high school. November 2003 - Runs track as part of his rehabilitation program at the Sports Science Institute at the University of Pretoria. June 2004 - Is given his first pair of carbon fiber J-shaped limbs, with the brand name Flex-Foot Cheetah. September 2004 - Competes in the Athens Paralympics, winning the gold medal for the 200m and the bronze for the 100m in the T44 class. He sets a Paralympic world record for the 100m. March 26, 2007 - The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) introduces rule 144.2, which prohibits: (e) Use of any technical device that incorporates springs, wheels or any other element that provides the user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device. July 13, 2007 - In Rome, Pistorius finishes second in the 400m ‘B’ race against able-bodied athletes. The race is an IAAF test to observe and determine if rule 144.2 is being broken. The results are inconclusive. November 12-13, 2007 - Completes a series of tests in Cologne, Germany, to evaluate the metabolic differences in amputees and non-amputees and whether those differences caused by use of the Flex-Foot Cheetah prosthetics violate rule 144.2. The report claims that the prosthetics give Pistorius an advantage over able-bodied competitors, which Pistorius strongly rejects. January 14, 2008 - Pistorius is banned from competing in all IAAF-sanctioned events, “…running with these prostheses requires a less-important vertical movement associated with a lesser mechanical effort to raise the body, and the energy loss resulting from the use of these prostheses is significantly lower than that resulting from a human ankle joint at a maximal sprint speed.” The ruling is based on the evaluation done in Germany in November 2007. On February 13, 2008, Pistorius files an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

May 20, 2014 - The judge rules that Pistorius must undergo mental health examinations over the next month. The testing was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who said that the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant, stemming partly from the amputation of both of his lower legs. June 30, 2014 - A psychiatric assessment finds that Pistorius was not mentally incapacitated when he shot Steenkamp. September 12, 2014 - Pistorius is found guilty of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally – but unlawfully – killing a person. On October 21, 2014, he is sentenced to 5 years in prison. June 8, 2015 - South Africa’s Department of Correctional Services tells CNN that a parole board is set to recommend that Pistorius be released from prison and transferred to house arrest in August.

November 24, 2017 - The Supreme Court of Appeal increases Pistorius’ sentence to 13 years and five months for the murder of Steenkamp. April 9, 2018 - Pistorius loses his final appeal. November 9, 2021 - Under South Africa’s victim-offender dialogue policy, Pistorius will meet with the family of Steenkamp before being granted a parole hearing and possibly released early from prison.

      Oscar Pistorius denied parole
    ","Disgraced South African Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius was denied parole on Friday, according to local authorities who said he has yet to complete his minimum sentence. According to South African law, inmates can be considered for parole after serving half of their sentence if they meet conditions, like good behavior in prison. The former Olympic sprinter shot his partner Reeva Steenkamp four times through the bathroom door of his house in 2013, denying that he killed her in a fit of anger and saying instead he had mistaken her for an intruder. He was originally sentenced to 13 years and five months imprisonment. A spokesperson for South Africa’s Correctional Services, Singabakho Nxumalo, told CNN that Pistorius’ submission for parole was not granted because he was not yet eligible – an issue clarified by the country’s top appeals court earlier this week. “The parole board has granted Mr. Pistorius a further profile for August 2024 and the reason behind that is that Mr. Pistorius is yet to serve a minimum detention period as per the clarification order provided by the Supreme Court of Appeal, which was only provided to the department on the 28th of March 2023,” Nxumalo said. Pistorius must now continue to serve his sentence until a new parole hearing in August 2024. The parole board’s decision was quickly hailed by Steenkamp’s parents, who had opposed an early release, according to their lawyer. “While we welcome today’s decision, today is not a cause for celebration. We miss Reeva terribly and will do so for the rest of our lives. We believe in justice and hope that it continues to prevail,” their lawyer Tania Koen told CNN. In 2018, the athlete’s father Henke Pistorius told the UK’s Times newspaper that he ran bible classes and prayer groups for prisoners, including the jail’s most feared gang leader. To be eligible for parole, Pistorius had to participate in South Africa’s “Restorative Justice” process, which gives offenders the opportunity to “acknowledge and take responsibility for their actions.” The athlete – once feted as an inspirational figure after competing in the 2012 Olympics – became the center of a trial that was followed around the world. During the trial, Pistorius pleaded not guilty to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp’s killing. Prosecutors argued her killing was deliberate and that the shooting happened after the couple had an argument. He frequently broke down in court and his past behavior was closely scrutinized. Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter in 2014 and sentenced to five years. But a higher court overturned the conviction and changed it to murder a year later, increasing his sentence to six years in prison. The ruling was appealed by prosecutors who claimed the sentence was too lenient. Pistorius’ sentence was increased to 13 years and five months by South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal in 2017.

      Dozens of dead stingrays found on beach in Brazil
    ","Dozens of dead stingrays appeared on a beach in Rio de Janeiro this week, sparking confusion and concern in the local community. Local fishermen reported the first sightings early on Tuesday. A woman who lives in the fishing village said she noticed the incident shortly after dawn, prompting the arrival of vultures. “This made us all sad. We’ve never seen the death of stingrays like this here,” said fisherman Renato dos Reis Oliveira. Biologist Ricardo Gomes, from the Mar Urbano Institute, argued the absence of other dead species on the beach indicates the incident was likely not caused by pollutants or a lack of oxygen in the water. “This makes the hypothesis of trawling more evident in the cases of these stingrays,” he said. Trawling is a fishing technique that involves pulling a net through the water behind one or more boats. “This is not (the stingray’s natural) place, so this is strange even for the people who are here and who live off fishing,” said environmentalist Isabeli Delois. “Something very bad happened,” she added.

      Brazilian President Lula travels to China with hopes for trade and peace
    ","Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is heading to China on a state visit this week, with talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to focus largely on trade, as well as the war in Ukraine. The 77-year-old Lula had originally planned to visit Beijing last month, but was hospitalized with a bout of pneumonia. On Monday, his office announced that the trip was back on, with Brazil’s goal “to relaunch its relations with the country that has been its main trading partner since 2009.” The Brazilian delegation arriving in China with Lula on Wednesday includes businessmen, state governors, congressmen and ministers, who seek to sign over 20 bilateral agreements with China on agriculture, livestock, tech, travel and tourism, among others. Government figures show that China imported the equivalent of over US$89.7 billion in Brazilian products last year, and exported almost US$60.7 billion to Brazil, setting the trade value between the two countries at US$150.4 billion. According to the Brazilian presidency, trade between the two countries has “increased 21 times since Lula’s first visit to China in 2004.” Lula previously served two terms as Brazilian president, and has already made two official visits to the country. Among the dozens of accords expected to be finalized during the visit is one regarding the joint Brazilian-Chinese construction of CBERS-6 satellites, a model that “has improved technology that allows for efficient monitoring of biomes such as the Amazon Rainforest even on cloudy days,” according to a handout from the Brazilian government published Monday. While in China, Lula will also attend former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s inauguration in Shanghai as head of BRICS’s New Development Bank, a commercial bloc formed by the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Xi and Lula are also expected to discuss the war in Ukraine, with both leaders having previously positioned their countries as potential mediators for the conflict. Like many leaders in middle income and developing countries, Lula has adopted a policy of non-intervention over the war in Ukraine, rebuffing efforts led by US President Joe Biden to unite the global community in opposition to Russia’s invasion. In a February interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Lula – who in his previous term played an important role during nuclear discussions between the US and Iran – predicted that he would “talk a lot with President Xi Jinping about the role that China has to play on the peace issues (in Ukraine). “This is my work. This is the work that I have to do. I started with the German Chancellor (Olaf Scholz). I talked with (French President Emmanuel) Macron on the phone. I’ll talk with President Biden now. I’ll talk to Xi Jinping, with the Indians, with the – with all the countries. We have to have a group of people and countries that talk about peace.” Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira hinted at hopes for a potential consensus among some countries emerging from Lula’s trip, AFP reported earlier this week. “By the time Lula returns home, a group of mediator countries will have been created,” Vieira reportedly said. His visit to China comes amid wider efforts to booster Brazil’s international relations, including a recent trip to Argentina for a meeting of CELAC – a bloc of Latin American and Caribbean states – that also included a delegation from the United States. The trip will “usher in a new era and a new future for China-Brazil relations,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said. After his visit to China, Lula is scheduled to go to the United Arab Emirates for a state visit as well.

      4 people found dead near a hotel in Cancun
    ","Four people were found dead near a hotel in Cancun on Monday, according to Mexican officials, the latest bout of violence in the popular tourist destination. Two people have been arrested for their possible involvement in the deaths of four people, according to the attorney general of the state of Quintana Roo. All of the deceased are Mexicans, said José Pablo Mathey Cruz, the secretary of public security of Benito Juárez, the municipality where Cancun is located. He said the suspects are allegedly engaged in the sale and distribution of narcotics, adding that footage from local security cameras and the joint work of local authorities helped lead to their arrest. The prosecutor’s office confirmed earlier on Monday that three people had been found dead and an investigation was opened. Later, the office said they found a fourth body. Polo Gallegos, a tourist who was in the area at the time of the shooting, told CNN en Español that he heard shots while at a nearby gym at around 10 a.m. local time. “We heard the shots and they hid all of us in an office and they kept us there until the incident was over. Everyone kept us there until they secured the area, and right now there are police, the Navy, everyone, everyone in the beach area and it’s very uncomfortable for us,” he said. The security situation in Cancun has deteriorated in recent years. In 2021, the Mexican government said the National Guard would permanently deploy to Cancun and its surrounding area following a rise in violence there linked to organized crime, Reuters reported. There have been a series of violent incidents around the Caribbean coastal area. In early 2022, two people died after shots were fired in a hotel at Playa del Carmen, according to CNN en Español. There were shootings reported in late 2021 in the tourist areas of Puerto Morelos and Cancun. The State Department advises travelers to “exercise increased caution due to crime and kidnapping” in the state of Quintana Roo. The advisory says that violence and criminal activity may occur anywhere, “including in popular tourist destinations.” “Travelers should maintain a high level of situational awareness, avoid areas where illicit activities occur, and promptly depart from potentially dangerous situations,” the advisory warns.

      Mexico to issue arrest warrants over deadly fire at migrant detention center
    ","Mexico will issue arrest warrants for those allegedly responsible for the deaths of 39 people in a fire at a migrant detention center, officials said. Authorities are investigating Monday’s blaze at the center in Ciudad Juarez as a homicide. A further 27 people were injured. The Mexican government has so far identified at least eight people who could be held responsible, Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodriguez said Wednesday. Among them are two federal agents, one state migration agent and several members of a private security company. Sara Irene Herrerías Guerra, head of the Specialized Prosecutor for Human Rights of the Attorney General of Mexico, said none of the public employees or the private security officers made any attempt to open a locked door and allow the migrants to escape the burning facility. The fire started when a group of migrants gathered mattresses and set them ablaze, Herrerías said. Migrants who were inside the center have said that a small group set the fire as part of a protest, she added. According to Herrerías, one of the arrest warrants is for a migrant who allegedly started the fire. A surveillance video from inside the center obtained by CNN shows how quickly the flames spread throughout the holding area after inmates set mattresses on fire. It also appears to show that those detained were behind bars with the gate locked. Rodriguez told reporters that the Mexican foreign ministry has been in contact with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Venezuela to identify the victims, repatriate their bodies and support the families of those affected. Asked about a discrepancy in the number of reported victims, Rodriguez said that the current death toll would change because several deceased and injured migrants haven’t yet been identified. Reporters at the news conference questioned whether Monday’s incident raised concerns about the level of funding allocated to Mexico’s migration institution, but officials said the budget had been deemed adequate following a review. Ciudad Juarez is located in northern Mexico, on the border with the United States. It is one of a number of Mexican border cities which have had to deal with migrants sent back from the US by a pandemic-era public health restriction that is set to expire in early May. Migrants often wait for weeks or months in Mexico to present their case at a port of entry. In the meantime, many sleep rough in the streets, begging for change to survive.

      Blaze kills at least 38 people at migrant detention center near Mexico-US border
    ","At least 38 people died on Monday night when a fire broke out at a government-run migrant detention center in Ciudad Juarez, a city in northern Mexico, on the United States border, Mexican officials said Tuesday. Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INM) revised the death toll down to 38 from after they announced the death toll as at least 40 deaths earlier Tuesday. The deadly blaze has underlined the urgent situation in Mexican cities along the border, which have been inundated with migrants sent back from the US by a pandemic-era public health restriction that is set to expire in early May. The fire at the INM facility started shortly after 10 p.m. inside an accommodation area, according to the agency. Authorities said it broke out after they picked up and detained a group of migrants from the streets of the border city, which sits across from El Paso, Texas. Sixty-eight men from Central and South America were being held at the facility, the INM said in a statement. At least 28 Guatemalan nationals were among the dead, Guatemala’s Institute of Migration confirmed. One man was Colombian, one was Ecuadorian, 12 were Salvadorans, 13 were Honduran and 13 were Venezuelan, the INM said. It is unclear how many people of each nationality were killed or injured. At least 11 migrants remain in hospital following the fire, according to the government of Mexico’s Chihuahua state. Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that the men detained at the center were angry at the officials, and had been demonstrating against their deportation. “What we know so far is that migrants from Central America and some from Venezuela were in that shelter. We still do not know exactly the names and nationalities of those who unfortunately lost their lives,” López Obrador said. “This had to do with a protest that they started after, we assume, they found out that they were going to be deported, and as a protest, they put mattresses from the shelter at the door of the shelter, and they set fire to them and they did not imagine that this was going to cause this terrible accident.” “It is very sad that this is happening,” the president added. Video recorded at the scene of the tragedy showed first responders aiding survivors, wrapping them in silver, thermal blankets, before placing them on stretchers and into ambulances. Firefighters carried limp, lifeless bodies from the building. Some of the victims’ bodies were covered in black soot, placed next to each other in a row. A separate surveillance video from inside the center obtained by CNN shows how quickly the flames spread throughout the holding area after inmates set mattresses on fire. it also appears to show that those detained were behind bars with the gate locked. Andrea Chavez, Ciudad Juarez’s federal deputy, shared her condolences with families of the migrants, and said that Mexican authorities had launched an investigation to determine who was responsible for the tragedy. “It is with deep sadness and grief that we learned of the fire that occurred inside the INM in Ciudad Juárez,” she said on Twitter. An eyewitness to the blaze, a Venezuelan woman whose husband was trapped inside the building and injured in the fire, spoke to Reuters news agency. Fighting back tears, she blamed Mexican authorities and claimed the doors to the detention center were not opened. “At 10 p.m., we started to see smoke billowing from everywhere, everybody ran away but they left the men locked in. Everybody was removed from the area, but they left the men locked in. They never opened the door,” 31-year-old Viangly Infante, a Venezuelan national, told the agency. Her husband, 27-year-old Eduard Caraballo, was inside the detention center and survived by spraying water on himself, according to Infante, who said she saw many dead bodies. He was taken to the hospital with breathing problems, Reuters reported. Another Venezuelan migrant, Emilio Jose, who was looking for his wife, told Reuters that he was not being given any information regarding her whereabouts. “Even if we are illegal or undocumented, we are human beings who feel. Look at what happened; some people are injured and are suffering the consequences of what happened,” he said. The INM said it strongly rejected “the acts that led to this tragedy,” adding that an investigation was underway. They did not indicate the cause of the fire. CNN has reached out to Mexico’s migration authorities for comment on the blaze. Later on Tuesday, the agency said that migrants injured in the fire would be granted “visitor cards,” which will allow them to obtain legal immigration status in Mexico valid for one year. “The immigration authority will provide visitor cards for humanitarian reasons to the injured and will cover the medical requirements for a speedy recovery,” INM commissioner Francisco Garduño said during a visit to local hospitals where migrants were being treated. Migrants who are unaccompanied minors, have witnessed a crime or been victim to a crime while in Mexico are eligible for a visitor card, according to the Mexican immigration agency. The blaze is one of the worst in recent years in Mexico, which has seen record levels of crossings on its northern border, as people try to make it into the US. Migrant numbers at the US-Mexico border have been on the rise since last year, with increasing numbers of people from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Colombia – many fleeing repressive government and stark economic pressures. On March 12, hundreds of people tried to cross the border, gathering at a bridge connecting Ciudad Juárez with El Paso, Texas. The attempt at a mass entry caused disruptions along the border and authorities erected barricades to block the flow. Migrants often wait for weeks or months in Mexico to present their case at a port of entry. In the meantime, many sleep rough in the streets, begging for change to survive. Earlier this year, the Biden administration ramped up efforts to curb crossings. In February, it released a new rule that largely prohibits migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the shared frontier from applying for asylum in the US, marking a significant departure from decadeslong protocol. The proposed regulation is likely to take effect in May, when a Trump-era pandemic border restriction, known as Title 42, is set to expire in May. The Biden administration has leaned on Title 42, which has allowed border officials to turn away migrants who might otherwise qualify for asylum to be expelled, turned back to Mexico or sent directly to their home countries. But with the clock ticking on its potential expiration and amid ongoing litigation, officials are considering other enforcement measures as tens of thousands of migrants continue to move in the Western Hemisphere. The proposal has been panned by human rights advocates and immigration experts, who say, among other things, it may increase Mexico’s attractiveness as a pit stop for those ultimately aiming to request asylum in the US. On Tuesday, the International Rescue Committee said that the fire was proof of the pressing need to ensure systems are in place to provide safety for people in need of international protection. “As Mexico receives historic numbers of new asylum claims and the U.S. continues to implement policies that push asylum seekers back into Mexico, humanitarian infrastructure in the country is increasingly strained and more people are stuck in highly vulnerable situations,” Rafael Velásquez, country director for the IRC in Mexico, said. “These risks are particularly tangible in cities along the U.S.-Mexico border, such as Ciudad Juárez, which for years have seen increasing numbers of displaced people as new and stricter border policies have been put in place.” ",1282,americas,2023-03-28,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/americas/mexico-migrants-fire-intl/index.html

      This lizard species stress-eats to cope with noisy US Army aircraft
    ","Living in a neighborhood with lots of noise can make you jittery, especially if you’re a lizard that’s just a few inches long. It’s no wonder that lizards exposed to noise pollution from low-flying fighter jets have resorted to stress-eating. Colorado checkered whiptails (Aspidoscelis neotesselatus) — striped and patterned lizards that live only in southeastern Colorado — are an all-female species that reproduce asexually. They also endure considerable noise from US Army flyovers. When researchers recently examined blood samples from these lizards, they detected elevated stress levels from the din. The lizards also had a coping strategy: They moved less, and they ate more. By snacking during noisy flyovers, the lizards are likely replenishing energy that’s lost during metabolic responses to stress, scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Amphibian and Reptile Science. “We show that noise disturbance does have measurable physiological impacts on Colorado checkered whiptails,” co-lead study author Megen Kepas, a doctoral student at Utah State University, said in a statement. “We also show that they are somewhat resilient and may compensate for this to some degree,” by changing how much they eat and move when aircraft are nearby. “I found the study to be super interesting,” Tracy Langkilde, a professor of biology and the Verne M. Willaman Dean at Pennsylvania State University’s Eberly College of Science, told CNN. “There’s been growing interest in the effects of noise on native animals,” but research in this area focuses primarily on birds, said Langkilde, who was not involved in the study. Langkilde’s research investigates stress responses in wood frogs that experience high levels of traffic noise near the roadside ponds where they breed. “Seeing something about lizards is expanding our understanding on how noise affects our native species in really important ways,” she said. In skies over grassland habitats that the checkered whiptails call home, military aircraft are a frequent presence. The lizard’s range extends into the US Army’s Fort Carson Military Base in Colorado Springs, which covers 212 square miles (550 square km) and contains several populations of the lizard. Fort Carson was the main funder of the research. Fighter jets and transport aircraft soar overhead, along with Black Hawk, Apache and Chinook helicopters, often within 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) above the ground, according to the study. At times when there were no flyovers, ground readings registered no higher than 56 decibels (dB), about as loud as a refrigerator’s hum. By comparison, ground readings during flyovers surged to 112 dB — louder than a jackhammer and just above the average pain threshold for humans. During checkered whiptails’ reproductive season in 2021, the scientists observed dozens of lizards during flyovers. They caught, weighed and measured the lizards, collecting blood samples from 82 females. The researchers also checked to see if lizards were carrying eggs, using a portable ultrasound device to determine egg size and number before marking and releasing the animals. Analysis of the blood samples showed elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increased production of ketones, which are energy-burning compounds associated with heightened stress. Flyovers also boosted the lizards’ interest in food, with lizards hunkering down and spending more time eating than they did when aircraft were absent. Other studies have shown animals “freezing” in response to disruptive noise, as the lizards did. But the lizards’ feeding behavior “is quite novel,” as most prior research found that noise pollution typically led to animals eating less, the scientists wrote in the study. “Compensatory eating would allow individuals to maintain their energy levels during a stressful event,” said co-first author Layne Sermersheim, a master’s candidate at Utah State University, in a statement. “This is important because metabolism, physical activity, investment into reproduction, and hormonal responses require energy.” In humans, persistent stress can also raise cortisol levels, which can lead to increased appetite and stress-eating. Such behaviors sometimes persist even after the original stress triggers subside. As for the lizards, stress from the flyovers could be reduced if pilots avoided locations where lizards gather during breeding season, the authors suggested. Another remedy could be flying high enough to lower noise at ground level to below 50 dB. A growing body of evidence shows that human noise pollution disrupts wildlife on land and in the oceans; it can affect the volume and frequency of animal vocalizations and may change their reproductive behavior, or where they choose to hunt. “Although, the stress-eating — this is the first time that I know of that anyone has found this effect in response to anthropogenic stresses in the field,” Langkilde said. While eating more makes sense for quickly replenishing stress-related energy loss, it remains to be seen how this behavior could affect lizard populations over the long term, she added. “Understanding the implications of these adaptations is really important if we’re truly to understand the consequences,” Langkilde said.

      What Elian Gonzalez wants for Cuba
    ","More than two decades after he was found clinging to an inner tube in the Straits of Florida, Elián González is taking on his most high profile role since the bitter custody battle that returned him to Cuba. On Monday, Cuba’s National Election Council said that the 470 candidates for the island’s National Assembly – González included—were approved by voters. More than 89% of voters in González’s hometown of Cárdenas voted for him, according to officials. There was little doubt about the final result; candidates are pre-selected and run unopposed. And being a lawmaker in Cuba does not necessarily imply having a lot of power. Legislators only meet a few times a year, invariably support government proposals and are not even paid. But González’s new position signals that he will be more visible at a time when the Cuban government badly needs representatives with name recognition abroad, as well as among younger Cubans who are leaving the island in record numbers. “I am someone the American people know and I can help bring the American and Cuban people together and not just the people,” a now-bearded González, 29, told CNN. “That our governments reach an understanding and remove all the barriers between us. Our country doesn’t have any sanctions on the United States.” González spoke with CNN after going to vote on Sunday with his wife and their two-year-old daughter in Cárdenas, which, like many small cities in Cuba, has been ravaged by economic calamity: harsher US sanctions, the sluggish pace of reforms by the communist-run government, a pandemic that scared off tourists and inflation that has made state salaries nearly worthless. Having a daughter, González said, gave him a new perspective on the decisions his own father Juan Miguel made when in 1999 Elián’s mother drowned after attempting to take him with a group of migrants on the dangerous journey by boat across the Florida Straits. “It’s helped me to understand my father,” he said. “It’s made me more sensitive. It’s helped me understand how all the Cubans feel who are separated from their families and fathers who aren’t able to give all the attention and things their children want.” After being rescued, González was placed with relatives in Miami. News of his miraculous survival led many in Miami’s anti-Castro exile community to argue that the wishes of González’s mother should be honored and the boy needed to stay in Florida. The dispute ignited Cold War-era passions, with then-Cuban President Fidel Castro leading protests demanding Elián’s return in front of the US Embassy in Havana, and Cuban exile leaders vowing that they would not allow the boy to return to live under a dictatorship. Finally, after Elián’s father Juan Miguel traveled to Washington DC, US courts backed his requests to be reunited with his son. A nighttime raid on his relatives’ home in Miami by armed federal agents sparked riots in the city and returned Elián to his father. When the US Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case, Elián and Juan Miguel traveled back to the island. In Cuba, the now-famous González and his family led a not entirely normal life. Fidel Castro came to the boy’s birthday parties in Cárdenas and the family had bodyguards. Elián went to a military school and studied engineering. When he did grant infrequent interviews he voiced support for the revolution, which many in Miami said was proof Elián had been brainwashed and should never have been allowed to go back to Cuba. “At 29, he is a show pony for Cuba, as many exiles feared,” said an opinion article published by the Miami Herald Editorial Board in February. “Many historic Cuban exiles in Miami will look away from this news with heavy hearts.” Even as González has grown up and moved on, the anger between those loyal to the revolution and Cuba exiles forced to leave the island still burns white hot. At a World Baseball Classic game in Miami in March that in theory was intended to bring different countries together over a shared love of sport, exiles jeered the Cuban players on the field. Officials in Havana responded that the exiles were “worms,” an epithet that Fidel Castro flung at Cubans leaving the island. More than sixty years after the Cuban revolution, as the island inches nearer to economic ruin and exiles are no closer to returning home, it’s difficult for either side to really believe they are winning. González is perhaps the only Cuban who has been inside the centers of power in both Miami and Havana, seeing how those who run Cuba, and those who lost it, think and function. Despite being thrust into the middle of that bruising tug of war, González said he bears no ill will, that he’s grateful for the Americans who helped him get home and that he hopes to reconcile with the relatives in Florida who tried to prevent his return. And as a rare Cuban who has left and come back, he hopes the exodus of Cubans currently leaving the island will also be able to see a future in their homeland. “What we want one day is Cuban exiles are no longer exiled, that they come home,” González said. “When the young people that have left are willing to work for Cuba, the well-being of Cubans beyond a political party and beyond ideologies,” he said. “Our doors are open to build a better country which is what we need.” ",911,americas,2023-03-27,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/americas/elian-gonzalez-elected-cuban-lawmaker-intl/index.html

      Ecuador opens terrorism investigation after journalists receive explosive devices in mail
    ","Ecuador’s public prosecutor has opened a terrorism investigation after at least five journalists received envelopes containing explosive devices. Three of the envelopes reached the newsrooms of Ecuavisa, Teleamazonas and TC Televisión television channels, while two further envelopes addressed to radio station EXA FM and journalist Carlos Vera were intercepted, the country’s Interior Minister Juan Zapata said Monday. “This is an absolutely clear message of silencing journalists who have been strong in their way of being or silencing the media,” said Zapata, who condemned the acts and confirmed that an in depth investigation is underway. In a statement Monday, Ecuador’s Public Prosecutor’s Office said it had opened a terrorism investigation following the various attacks. Evidence has been collected from the media outlets that received envelopes containing the devices, and all of the devices will be included in a single investigation because of the similarities between them, it said in the statement. On Monday, Ecuavisa TV journalist Lenin Artieda suffered minor injuries when he plugged a memory stick containing an explosive device into his computer, the outlet reported in a note published on its website. The explosion did not injure anyone else, nor did it cause any material damage to the newsroom, which is located in the city of Guayaquil, southern Ecuador. The prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation into the attack, and confirmed that Artieda had suffered minor injuries. Also on Monday, TC Televisión received an envelope containing an explosive, addressed to journalist Mauricio Ayora, according to Ecuador’s Interior Minister Zapata. The station said the envelope had not been opened. A third envelope containing explosives arrived at the Teleamazonas newsroom in the capital city Quito last Thursday, addressed to presenter and executive producer Milton Pérez, but it was not delivered until Monday, Pérez confirmed to CNN. A fourth envelope, addressed to journalist Miguel Rivadeneira of radio station EXA FM, did not reach its destination because it was intercepted at a parcel delivery service in Quito on Monday, according to EXA FM. Álvaro Rosero, director of the media outlet, tweeted that the envelope had originally been sent last Wednesday. And finally, the envelope addressed to Carlos Vera was intercepted by the same parcel delivery company in Guayaquil, according to minister Zapata. After learning of the attack on Ecuavisa, the Ecuadorian government said in a statement that it “categorically rejects all types of violent acts perpetrated against journalists or the media.” Mario Cuvi, deputy minister of governance, expressed solidarity with the journalists. “All our support for the media in the face of these threats against freedom of expression,” he tweeted.

      Pistol used in deadly kidnapping of Americans in Mexican border city was purchased in the US, criminal complaint says
    ","One of the weapons used in the deadly abduction of four Americans in the Mexican border city of Matamoros earlier this month was purchased in the United States and provided to a Mexican cartel, according to a federal court document. Roberto Lugardo Moreno was arrested and charged with knowingly conspiring to export or send from the United States a “multi-caliber AR style pistol” for use by the Gulf Cartel, according to the criminal complaint filed Saturday in US District Court in Brownsville, Texas. Last week, the gun was “recovered by Mexican authorities and linked to an incident involving the murders and kidnappings of US citizens which occurred on March 3, 2023 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico,” the complaint states. The four Americans were kidnapped as they were driving to a medical appointment, two family members told CNN earlier this month. LaTavia Washington McGee and Eric Williams survived the kidnapping, while Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were killed. Mexican authorities have arrested six people in the kidnapping case. Lugardo Moreno told investigators he purchased the pistol on October 17, 2019, for individuals that he knew were going to provide the weapon and other guns to a Gulf Cartel figure in Mexico, according to the criminal complaint. During that time, Lugardo Moreno said he received a $100 payment, the complaint states. Lugardo Moreno also told investigators that he did not apply for a license to export the firearm from the United States to Mexico. CNN has reached out to the FBI and to Lugardo Moreno’s attorney of record for comment and has not immediately heard back. Lugardo Moreno faced a federal judge Monday and is being held without bond, according to the court docket. This story was first reported by MYRGV.com.

      At least 13 dead after magnitude 6.8 earthquake shakes Ecuador
    ","At least 13 people died after a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Ecuador on Saturday afternoon, according to government officials. The earthquake struck near the southern town of Baláo and was more than 65 km (nearly 41 miles) deep, according to the United States Geological Survey. An estimated 461 people were injured in the quake, according to a report from the Ecuadorian president’s office. The government had previously reported that 16 people were killed but later revised the death toll. In the province of El Oro, at least 11 people died. At least one other death was reported in the province of Azuay, according to the communications department for Ecuador’s president. In an earlier statement, authorities said the person in Azuay was killed when a wall collapsed onto a car and that at least three of the victims in El Oro died when a security camera tower came down. People who were injured were being treated at hospitals, the Presidency added, but did not provide further details. The USGS gave the tremor an “orange alert,” saying “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread.” “Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response,” the USGS added. It also estimated damage and economic losses were possible. Relatives of a CNN producer in the western port city of Guayaquil said they felt “very strong” tremors. CNN afiliate Ecuavisa reported structural damage to buildings in Cuenca, one of the country’s biggest cities. The historic city is in the UN list of world heritage sites.

      Another cheetah has died after relocation to India, the second in less than a month
    ","A cheetah from Africa has died two months after being reintroduced to India as part of an intercontinental effort to revive the big cat in the country, the second animal from the program to have passed away in less than a month. India’s wildlife department said the male, called Uday, died at the Kuno National Park on Sunday in central Madhya Pradesh state, according to CNN’s affliate News18. The cause of death was not immediately known and authorities will perform a post-mortem to find out more, the outlet reported. Uday – who was named by Indian citizens in a contest – was among 20 cheetahs airlifted to India over the past few months from Africa. The Indian government’s ultimate plan is to introduce 50 big cats over the next five years. The news of the deceased 6-year-old cheetah came just three weeks after his fellow feline, Sasha, died from a kidney infection. Uday was one of 12 cheetahs flown across the ocean from South Africa in February. Sasha hails from another group of eight sent from Namibia in September last year. South African veterinarian Adrian Tordiffe, who helped coordinate the move earlier, said experts were investigating various possibilities and awaiting tests for further confirmation. “At this stage, it appears to be a rare random cause that is unlikely to pose any risk to the other cheetahs,” he said, adding that possible causes could range from severe botulism to a snake bite. Laurie Marker, founder of the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which also helped with transferring the animals, said re-establishing a population is very difficult. “Losses are to be expected and for unexpected reasons,” he said. “We are looking at populations which individuals are a part of and we all care about these individuals, but we also have to think of the big picture.” While two cheetahs have died since being reintroduced, the overall population has nonetheless grown. In late March, the country welcomed four newborn cheetahs for the first time since the species disappeared from India more than 70 years ago. Cheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952, but the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change hopes they’ll be able to bring the species back. The animals chosen were selected “based on an assessment of health, wild disposition, hunting skills, and ability to contribute genetics that will result in a strong founder population,” according to CCF’s earlier statement. The cheetahs were first sent to a quarantine enclosure before being moved to acclimatization zones and eventually released into the park’s hunting enclosures. Cheetahs are found in southern and eastern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, and Tanzania, with less than 7,000 left in the wild, according to the World Wide Fund (WWF).

      World War II shipwreck of SS Montevideo Maru, which sank with over 1,000 POWs, found in South China Sea
    ","A Japanese merchant ship that sank during World War II while carrying over 1,000 prisoners of war in Australia’s largest loss of life at sea has been found. The Montevideo Maru was discovered off the northwest coast of the Philippines’ Luzon island at a depth of more than 4,000 meters (13,000ft) in the South China Sea, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles confirmed in a video he posted on Saturday from his Twitter account. The discovery brought to an end to “one of the most tragic chapters in Australia’s maritime history,” he said. The vessel was transporting approximately 1,060 prisoners from around 16 countries, including 850 Australian service members, from the former Australian territory of New Guinea to what was then the Japanese-occupied island of Hainan when an American submarine torpedoed and sank the ship – which had not been marked as transporting prisoners of war – on July 1, 1942. “The absence of a location of the Montevideo Maru has represented unfinished business for the families of those who lost their lives,” Marles explained. Australian authorities commended those who had taken part in the search, including deep-sea survey specialists and members of Australia’s armed forces, thanking them for providing closure to those who lost loved ones 81 years prior. “I want to thank the Silentworld team and the dedicated researchers, including the Unrecovered War Casualties team at Army, who have never given up hope of finding the final resting place of the Montevideo Maru,” Chief of the Australian Army Lieutenant General Simon Stuart said. “A loss like this reaches down through the decades and reminds us all of the human cost of conflict. Lest We Forget,” Stuart added. “The extraordinary effort behind this discovery speaks for the enduring truth of Australia’s solemn national promise to always remember and honor those who served our country.

      Elephant Noor Jehan critically ill at Karachi Zoo after fall
    ","Noor Jehan, an elephant in Pakistan’s Karachi Zoo, is critically ill after the 17-year-old fell in a pond on Thursday in a small enclosure. Right after the fall Four Paws, a global animal welfare organization, recommended lifting Noor Jehan with a crane, ropes and belts. She has since been lying visibly weak with limited motion on a mound of sand, propped up against the only tree inside the enclosure. “Her condition is very critical at the moment. We are trying everything to save her,” Four Paws spokeswoman Katharina Braun said by email. “It is very important that she gets up as soon as possible, laying too long on the ground… can be life threatening.” Noor Jehan is suffering from a huge hematoma, or pool of clotted blood, inside her abdomen in addition to intestinal issues, Four Paws member Dr. Amir Khalil said during his visit to treat her last week. The veterinarian from Egypt had then given Noor Jehan a strong chance of survival. Reuters reported that the director of Karachi Zoo Khalid Hashmi was removed from is role on April 8 over complaints of negligence. His successor, Kanwar Ayub, said he was unsure if the complaints were true in the week following the Four Paw’s visit.

      Australian businessman accused of supplying suspected Chinese spies with AUKUS information
    ","An Australian man has been refused bail after being charged with a foreign interference offense for accepting cash from suspected Chinese intelligence agents, with a Sydney court saying his close ties to China made him a flight risk. Magistrate Michael Barko said Alexander Csergo was a “sophisticated, worldly businessperson” who had been on the radar of Australian intelligence for some time before his arrest on Friday. The prosecution had a strong case against Csergo, who had lived in China for decades, Barko said in refusing bail. Csergo is alleged to have arrived back in Australia this year with a “shopping list” of intelligence priorities he had been asked for by two people he had suspected since 2021 to be agents for China’s Ministry of State Security, the court heard. The pair, named in court only as “Ken” and “Evelyn,” first made contact with Csergo through LinkedIn. This shopping list had been discovered by Australian intelligence authorities three weeks after Csergo returned to Sydney, the court was told. Csergo had been allegedly asked to handwrite reports about Australia’s AUKUS defense technology partnership with the United States and Britain, the QUAD diplomatic partnership, iron ore and lithium mining, Barko said. A marketing executive, Csergo, 55, was arrested in the beachside suburb of Bondi on Friday. He is the second person charged under Australia’s foreign interference law, which criminalizes activity that helps a foreign power interfere with Australia’s sovereignty or national interest. It carries a maximum 15 year prison sentence. Csergo appeared in court via video link from Parklea Prison where he is being held as a high security prisoner. His mother and brother were in court. Csergo had told Australian intelligence agents in an interview that when he met Ken and Evelyn in Shanghai cafes and restaurants, the establishments had been empty and he suspected they had been cleared, Barko said. He developed a high level of anxiety and was in “survival mode,” he had told the Australian authorities. Csergo had exchanged around 3,300 WeChat messages with the pair, and had accepted cash payments in envelopes, Barko said. Barko raised concerns for Csergo’s safety, saying some people may not want him to give evidence against China. Csergo’s lawyer, Bernard Collaery, had sought bail, saying the reports Csergo had written were based on publicly sourced information and the case against his client was “shallow and unsubstantiated.” Prosecutor Conor McCraith disputed this, saying it was not all open source because he had engaged covertly with two others to prepare reports. He also said Csergo had not come to Australian authorities with his concerns about Ken and Evelyn, and had instead invited Ken to come to Australia. Collaery said making cash payments was a common business practice in China, and Csergo undertook the consulting work during the COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai as a source of income. “Of course he believed Ken and Evelyn were keeping tabs on him. That’s how it works in China, he became very worried about it,” Collaery said. Csergo had worked in China since 2002 in data marketing, including for a major international advertising agency. Collaery said Csergo’s career had come “tumbling down” since his arrest and he had no intention to return to China and instead planned to pursue the Australian government for damages for ruining his career. Collaery told media outside the court the case was a “civil liberties” issue and raised concerns about the scope of the foreign interference law introduced in 2018. “If you work as a consultant in any foreign country… and you undertake consulting work that may relate to Australia’s foreign influences or national security… you can be guilty of foreign interference,” he told reporters.

      Rebels holding New Zealand pilot hostage claim they’ve killed at least 13 Indonesian soldiers
    ","Separatist rebels in Indonesia’s Papua region say they have killed at least 13 Indonesian military soldiers after the army sent troops in search of captured New Zealand pilot, Phillip Mehrtens, who was taken hostage in February. The West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) said its soldiers attacked two Indonesian military posts in the Yal and Mugi districts in Nduga Regency over the weekend, according to a statement. The statement said the rebels shot dead 13 Indonesian military and police officials in the Mugi district. One body had been evacuated by the Indonesian military, but rebels were still in possession of 12 bodies, the statement added, without providing proof. In a televised press conference on Sunday, Indonesia’s military said one of their soldiers had been killed while combing the area near where Mehrtens is believed to be held. Some soldiers were missing, the military confirmed, but the weather had made it difficult to determine their whereabouts. “We know the location of the pilot, the operation has been escalated but the weather condition in Papua is unpredictable,” military spokesperson Julius Widjojono said. Separately, the rebels said nine Indonesian soldiers were executed on Sunday after being captured in the Yal district. The rebels said the attack on the Yal military post was “revenge” for an Indonesian military operation in the area in late March, when troops killed a pregnant woman and two rebel fighters. A military spokesperson in Papua, Herman Taryaman, denied soldiers carried out the March attack, saying the security forces were protecting civilians who were chased away by the rebels, Reuters reported. The rebel group said they’d proposed peace negotiations with the New Zealand and Indonesian governments, but for two months their letters had been ignored. They said New Zealand and the UN had an “obligation to urge the Indonesian Government to stop military operations” and said peace talks could be conducted under a “neutral third party, namely the UN organizational body.” Mehrtens was captured in February after landing a commercial Susi Air charter flight at the remote Paro Airport in Nduga regency. The Indonesian military maintains a heavy and controversial presence in Papua, which came under Jakarta’s control following a widely disputed 1969 vote overseen by the United Nations. Unrest in the impoverished but resource-rich region has escalated in recent years as separatist fighters demand independence. The TPNPB, designated by the Indonesian government as a terrorist group, originally said that Mehrtens would not be released until Jakarta acknowledged Papuan independence and withdrew its troops from the region. However, they later dropped that demand as a condition of the pilot’s release, and now want to talk with the New Zealand and Indonesian governments to secure his release, according to TPNPB spokesperson Sebby Sambom.

      A woman’s body was found in a bag at an abandoned bus stop. Malaysian police are investigating
    ","Police in Malaysia say they are investigating the death of a woman whose decomposing body was discovered in a travel bag at an abandoned bus station. A passerby found the bag near a building belonging to the state electricity company Tenaga Nasional Berhad earlier this week in Kulai, a district in the southern state of Johor, state news agency Bernama reported. Kulai district police chief Tok Beng Yeow said the highly decomposed state of the body – which he estimated at more than 50 per cent – had hampered initial identification efforts, according to Bernama. However, a preliminary post-mortem report by Sultanah Aminah Hospital suggested the body belonged to a woman over 25 years of age, who had sustained a head injury and may have died around two weeks ago. The district police chief said an investigation is ongoing as he appealed to local residents to come forward with information.

      Japan’s Kishida vows maximum security for G7, day after explosive thrown at him
    ","Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida vowed on Sunday to keep world leaders safe during G7 meetings in the country, a day after a man threw what appeared to be a smoke bomb at him during a campaign speech. “Japan as a whole must strive to provide maximum security during the dates of the summit (in Hiroshima next month) and other gatherings of dignitaries from around the world,” Kishida said Sunday, in comments that came as G7 foreign ministers, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, began three days of talks in the central Japanese town of Karuizawa, Nagano prefecture. On Saturday, Kishida had to abandon a speech he was giving in support of his ruling party’s candidate in a by-election in Wakayama when a small explosive device was thrown at him. While Kishida was evacuated unhurt, the attack has caused shockwaves in Japan, and drawn comparisons with the assassination last year of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was shot in July last year during a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Prior to Abe’s death the nation had rarely been associated with either political or gun violence. Campaigning is currently underway in Japan’s nationwide local elections and Kishida has already returned to campaigning in support of his Liberal Democratic Party. Speaking to reporters from his official residence in Tokyo, he vowed the attack would not disrupt the democratic process. “Violent acts taking place during elections, which are the basis of democracy, can never be tolerated,” Kishida said. “What is important is to carry through this election to the end. It is important for our country and for our democracy that the voice of the voters is clearly expressed through the election,” he said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Saturday that police would boost security when Kishida hosts the G7 summit in May, Reuters reported.

      Man arrested after explosion prompts evacuation of Japanese leader Fumio Kishida from speech venue
    ","Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was evacuated unharmed Saturday after an explosion at a venue where he was giving an outdoor speech. Video footage released by Japan’s public broadcaster NHK showed members of the public fleeing and a man being arrested following the explosion. The footage showed multiple men, believed to be police officers, holding the suspect on the ground. Other pictures showed a silver cylinder that appeared to have been thrown in Kishida’s direction. Local news agency Kyodo news reported that a man had been arrested after throwing “what appeared to be a smoke bomb.” The dramatic scenes took place in the city of Wakayama, shortly after a visit by Kishida to the local Saikazaki Fishing Port. The circumstances surrounding the suspected attack drew immediate comparisons to the assassination of the former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was shot in July last year during a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. The attack on Abe had shocked a nation that is rarely associated with political and gun violence. Kishida too had been giving a political speech, in his case, in support of his ruling party’s candidate in a local by-election for the House of Representatives in a Wakayama district. Campaigning is currently underway in Japan’s nationwide local elections. A city council member who was at the scene told NHK that a “cylindrical silver object” had flown “about two meters in front of me” shortly before the explosion was heard. Another eyewitness also reported seeing “a silver cylinder,” saying it “was thrown and then shone a bit before a big sound was heard.” Footage from NHK showed what appeared to be a young man wearing glasses, a mask, and a gray rucksack standing among a crowd of people gathered to see Kishida’s speech. Before the man is apprehended, he can be seen holding a silver cylinder and making hand gestures as though he is trying to light it, according to NHK. Japanese officials said later on Saturday that Kishida was safe and unharmed. NHK reported that he had been taken to another location where he was surrounded by police officers who were guarding him. The broadcaster said a man had been arrested on “suspicion of forcible obstruction of business” and taken to the Wakayama West Police Station for questioning. In Japan, “forcible obstruction of business” is a crime – “to obstruct another person’s business by force.” It is punishable by a jail term of up to three years and a fine of 500,000 yen. Wakayama Nishi Police Station officials told CNN that they had secured a suspect but are unable to release the suspect or any other information yet; they said more details would be announced later. In a speech broadcast on NHK following the attack the prime minister said police were investigating the explosion and apologized for causing concern, adding that “we are fighting an important election for our country.” Kishida resumed campaigning activities for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party shortly after and gave a speech at the Wakayama railway station. He is expected to head east to Chiba prefecture on Saturday afternoon and west to the Oita prefecture on Sunday. His party in a tweet on Saturday said his speeches would be held as scheduled. It too apologized for having “caused everyone concern.” Any comparisons to the assassination of Abe are likely to prove uncomfortable for Japan’s security establishment. Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, was shot while giving a campaign speech to a small crowd near a railway station in the city of Nara. The attack, which took place in broad daylight and involved what appeared to be a homemade weapon, shocked a nation where gun violence is rare and led to heated criticism of the police’s security measures. The national police chief later resigned following a report by his own agency that found there had been flaws in the protection offered to Abe. Doctors who tended to Abe revealed that the shot had penetrated all the way to his heart. A man was arrested following Abe’s death and is currently facing murder and firearms charges.

      Australian father sets world record with more than 3,200 push ups in an hour
    ","An Australian father has set a new world record for push ups, completing more than 3,206 in just one hour – that’s 53 every minute, or almost one a second. Lucas Helmke powered through the push ups at his local gym in Brisbane to claim the title set by another Australian man just last year – it’s the fourth time a new record has been set for the feat in three years. An accountant by trade, the 33-year-old father told Guinness World Records he wanted to “provide inspiration” for his one-year-old son by showing him “nothing is impossible.” Each push up had to be flawless to meet the standards required for an official world record. Helmke was required to keep his body straight on his way up, without bending his knees and waist, while reaching at least a 90-degree angle at the elbow when he lowered himself. He was docked 34 push ups due to improper form, and yet he went on to overtake record-setters that came before him. The previous record was set by Daniel Scali, who delivered 3,182 push ups, in April 2022. Helmke smashed the record at the Iron Underground gym in November last year and was recently informed by Guinness World Records that his record had been approved. Two previous record holders were also Australians. Posting the certificate on his Facebook last month, he wrote: “This one finally came through.” Helmke told Guiness World Records it took him two to three years to build up the physical strength to pull off the extraordinary feat. Given the competition, it is not clear how long his record will stand. Local media in Florida in March reported that American man Rob Stirling, 60, had managed 3,264 push ups late last month – but that claim is yet to be recognized by Guiness. Helmke meanwhile already has his sights on other records. “This will be the first record I wish to set of a number of other push up records,” Lucas said. “Then onto other physical records.” ",337,asia,2023-04-14,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/asia/australia-pushup-world-record-intl-hnk/index.html

      South Korea is paying ‘lonely young people’ $500 a month to re-enter society
    ","Some South Korean youth are so cut off from the world, the government is offering to pay them to “re-enter society.” The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family announced this week that it will provide up to 650,000 Korean won (about $500) per month to isolated social recluses, in a bid to support their “psychological and emotional stability and healthy growth.” About 3.1% of Koreans aged 19 to 39 are “reclusive lonely young people,” defined as living in a “limited space, in a state of being disconnected from the outside for more than a certain period of time, and have noticeable difficulty in living a normal life,” according to the ministry’s report, citing the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. That makes up about 338,000 people across the country, with 40% beginning their isolation in adolescence, according to the ministry. Various factors are thought to be at play, including financial hardship, mental illness, family problems or health challenges. The new measures specifically target young people as part of the larger Youth Welfare Support Act, which aims to support people extremely withdrawn from society, as well as youths without a guardian or school protection who are at risk of delinquency. The monthly allowance will be available to reclusive lonely young people aged 9 to 24 who live in a household earning below the median national income – defined in South Korea as about 5.4 million won (about $4,165) per month for a household of four people. The youths can apply for the program at a local administrative welfare center; their guardians, counselors or teachers can also apply on their behalf. “Reclusive youths can have slower physical growth due to irregular living and unbalanced nutrition, and are likely to face mental difficulties such as depression due to loss of social roles and delayed adaptation,” the ministry said, stressing the importance of “active support.” The report on Tuesday detailed several case studies, including one young student who had suffered from mental health issues and difficulties socializing since adolescence; she struggled to adjust to college, ultimately choosing not to attend, and withdrew further into herself. Another student faced domestic violence and hunger at home – making it difficult for her to leave the house or form relationships with people outside. Neither individual was identified. The report also detailed future plans for further action, such as distributing guidelines to local governments, boosting youth social safety nets and early detection systems, and working more closely with youth welfare facilities like shelters or rehabilitation centers. Some cities and local governments already have similar systems in place; Seoul, the country’s capital, has a “Reclusive Youth Support Project” that provides mental health counseling, hobby development and work training, and life coaching for isolated young people. This phenomenon isn’t unique to South Korea. Japan has a similar problem, with nearly 1.5 million reclusive lonely young people, who are known as hikikomori, according to a recent government survey. Some go out only to buy groceries or for occasional activities, while others don’t even leave their bedrooms. The phrase was coined in Japan as early as the 1980s. Authorities in that country have expressed increasing concern over the issue for the past decade, but Covid-19 has made things worse, the survey found. Of those surveyed, more than a fifth cited the pandemic as a significant factor in their reclusive lifestyle. Other common reasons cited were pregnancy, job loss, retirement and having poor interpersonal relationships.

      New ICBM could make it easier for North Korea to launch nuclear strike, analysts say
    ","North Korea says the new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) it tested Thursday was solid-fueled, a development that analysts say could allow it to launch long-range nuclear strikes more quickly and easily as it ramps up its missile program. The new missile, called the Hwasong-18, was launched just after 7 a.m. Thursday, triggering a brief evacuation order on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido before it fell into the waters east of the Korean Peninsula. State-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Friday the missile launch, attended by leader Kim Jong Un and his daughter, “would serve as a powerful strategic attack means of greater military efficiency.” KCNA quoted Kim as saying the Hwasong-18 would “radically promote” his county’s ability to launch a nuclear counterstrike to suppress invasions and protect the nation. Analysts noted that North Korea already has that ability, though the new missile may enhance it. “I think it demonstrates technological progress, but I would not describe this as a game changer,” said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said Friday Pyongyang still needs “more time and effort to successfully complete its solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile technology.” Thursday’s missile test was North Korea’s 12th of the year, according to CNN’s count, and it came after United States and South Korean forces had earlier this month concluded their biggest military drills in years, including a large amphibious landing exercise. It also came just days after a key meeting of North Korea’s Central Military Commission on Monday, when Kim stressed the need to quickly expand Pyongyang’s nuclear deterrence in response to “the ever-worsening security on the Korean Peninsula,” according to KCNA. The testing of a solid-fueled ICBM is important because they’re more stable than the liquid-fueled ones that North Korea has previously tested on long-range missile launches. A solid-fueled ICBM would be fueled during manufacturing and can be moved more easily to avoid detection before a launch that can be initiated in a matter of minutes, according to Joseph Dempsey, a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A liquid-fueled ICBM would need to undergo a fueling process at its launch site that could take hours, giving time for an adversary to detect and neutralize it, Dempsey wrote in an analysis earlier this year. Thursday’s launch came as no surprise to analysts who noted that North Korea had publicized a test of a solid-fueled rocket engine in December. Kim has wanted to bring his forces up to the standards of other nations with ICBMs after starting out with easier-to-master liquid-fuel technology – and the apparent success of the solid-fueled ICBM launch suggests his missile program is advancing. “At an earlier stage of North Korea’s missile program, liquid-fuel ICBMs represented the quickest and easiest path to achieving the country’s historic goal of being able to threaten the continental United States,” the IISS’ Dempsey wrote. “The addition of solid-fuel ICBMs to the missile force would make it a more credible strategic deterrent by providing a more capable, less vulnerable pre-emptive and retaliatory capability,” Dempsey wrote. The new Hwasong-18 has three stages, according to KCNA, just like the United States’ main ICBM, the Minuteman III, which is powered by three solid-fueled rocket motors. Jeffrey Lewis, an analyst at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said on Twitter that it was “no surprise” a solid-fueled ICBM wasted tested by North Korea, saying “it’s just easier to use solid-fuel missiles. “North Korea was always going to follow the same technical path as the US, Soviet Union, France, China, Israel and India,” he added. “Given that North Korea has been testing large diameter solid rocket motors for … several years, it’s been clear (to me at least) that since 2020 a test like this could have come at any time.” Even with Thursday’s test, some doubt remains as to whether a North Korean ICBM could actually deliver a nuclear warhead at a long distance, for instance to the mainland United States. Thursday’s test, like earlier North Korean ICBM tests, was fired at highly lofted trajectory, with the missile falling into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. To cover the longer distance to the mainland US, an ICBM launched from North Korea would have to be launched at a much flatter trajectory. ICBMs are fired into space, where they speed along outside Earth’s atmosphere before their payloads – nuclear warheads – undergo a fiery reentry process, much like a space shuttle or space capsule, before plunging down on their targets. If the process of reentering the atmosphere isn’t executed with pinpoint accuracy and with materials that can withstand the immense heat generated, the warhead would burn up before reaching its target. Reentering the atmosphere at a shallow angle that would be needed on a long-range strike can make the process more difficult. Panda, the Carnegie expert, said North Korea acknowledges that its lofted ICBM launches do not test reentry technology. But he said Pyongyang likely has the ability to master it. “Based on their competency with materials and engineering that we’ve seen in other areas, developing a robust enough reentry vehicle is not a substantial technical challenge,” he said. For Thursday’s test, KCNA said the highly lofted angle was used to prevent debris from posing a danger to other countries. On Thursday, the launch sparked momentary panic on the Japanese northern island of Hokkaido after the government’s emergency alert system warned residents to take cover. The warning was soon lifted. Soon after, fear turned into anger and confusion amid reports that the evacuation order had been sent in error, with local officials saying there was no possibility of the missile hitting the island, and Tokyo later confirming it had fallen outside Japanese territory, in waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula.

      Search continues for missing Sherpas on Everest as Nepal gears up for new climbing season
    ","Three Nepali Sherpas are missing after being buried by a block of snow on Mount Everest, according to a statement from Nepal’s Tourism Department on Wednesday. The trio were delivering materials to construct and clear a route to be used by climbers for this year’s spring climbing season to get to the top of the world’s tallest mountain. According to the statement, a search and rescue operation is being carried out using helicopters and teams on the ground. “It increasingly becomes difficult to search and rescue those buried in an avalanche. We are yet to get additional details about their whereabouts. The department is searching for them in coordination with the stakeholders,” the department’s Director General Hom Prasad Luitel told Nepal’s state newspaper The Rising Nepal. The avalanche took place between the base camp and Camp 1 at the place called the Dam. The area around the treacherous Khumbu icefall – a steep portion of a glacier shaped like a frozen waterfall – is one of the most treacherous sections of a route used to summit the 8,848.86 meter (about 29,032 feet) mountain. It is the Sherpas’ job to find a safe path across the heavily crevassed Khumbu glacier. Spring is the prime time to climb Mt. Everest, although some mountaineers may climb in the less favorable autumn season. A total of 243 climbers from 47 countries have so far received permission to the climb the mountain this spring season, according to the tourism department. Nepal is home to eight of the 10 highest mountains in the world, so mountaineering is a significant source of revenue, employing large teams of Sherpas, guides and porters to support groups of climbers.

      Jacinda Ardern bids emotional farewell as Chris Hipkins becomes New Zealand prime minister
    ","New Zealand welcomed a new prime minister on Wednesday, six days after Jacinda Ardern’s shock resignation ahead of an upcoming election. Chris Hipkins, 44, was sworn in on Wednesday at an inauguration ceremony in the capital Wellington. Hipkins was first elected to Parliament in 2008 and spearheaded the country’s Covid-19 policies in 2020. Before becoming prime minister, he was minister of education, minister of police, minister for the public service, and leader of the house. Hipkins was unanimously endorsed on Sunday by the ruling Labour party to succeed Ardern as its leader. He was the only nominee. Videos show Ardern leaving Parliament on Wednesday to cheers and applause from onlookers. Several lawmakers and members of staff had gathered outside, some of whom were clearly emotional as they said goodbye. Ardern attended her last official outing as prime minister on Tuesday, joining the annual Māori religious festival in the village of Rātana with Hipkins. “I have experienced such love, compassion, empathy and kindness in the job. That has been my predominant experience. So I leave feeling gratitude for having this wonderful role for so many years,” Ardern told reporters at the event. “I would hate for anyone to view my departure as a negative commentary on New Zealand,” she added. Ardern said the most important advice she gave Hipkins is “you do you.” “This is for him now. It’s for him to carve out his own space, be his own kind of leader. Actually, there is no advice I can really impart. I can share information, I can share experiences, but this is now for him,” she said. “You won’t find me commenting on domestic politics, I’ve had my time,” Ardern said, adding: “I’m ready to be a backbench MP, I’m ready to be a sister and a mom.” When Ardern became prime minister in 2017 at the age of 37 she was New Zealand’s third female leader and one of the youngest leaders in the world. Within a year, she had become only the second world leader to give birth in office. She announced her intention to resign last Thursday, speaking candidly about the toll the job has taken and reflecting on the various crises she has faced as head of the nation, including both the Covid-19 pandemic and the deadly 2019 Christchurch terror attack. “The only interesting angle that you will find is that after going on six years of some big challenges, I am human. Politicians are human,” she said. “We give all that we can for as long as we can, and then it’s time. And for me, it’s time.” ",433,australia,2023-01-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/australia/jacinda-ardern-chris-hipkins-new-zealand-intl-hnk/index.html

      Three more charged with alleged murder of teen walking home from school
    ","Three more people have been charged with the alleged murder of a 15-year-old boy who died after sustaining head injuries while walking home from school with a group of friends. Cassius Turvey died in hospital 10 days after the alleged attack last October, which occurred in a suburban area of Perth in Western Australia. The teenager’s death led to an outpouring of grief in the Indigenous community and vigils were held across Australia calling for “Justice for Cassius.” The first murder charge was laid in October against Jack Steven James Brearley, 21, who is accused of assaulting Cassius with a metal pole. Three other people charged with murder appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Friday – Aleesha Louise Gilmore, 20, Mitchell Colin Forth, 24 and Brodie Lee Palmer, 27, according to the ABC, Australia’s public broadcaster. None of the four defendants have entered a plea and will next appear in court on March 29. In the days following Cassius’ death, theories emerged about the motive behind the alleged attack, and as anger swelled Western Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch issued a statement urging the community to “refrain from unfounded speculation.” Immediately after the alleged attack, Cassius was rushed to hospital with cuts to his ear and forehead and stayed five days before being discharged, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his family’s supporters. Within hours of leaving hospital, Cassius suffered a seizure and two strokes, and died surrounded by family on October 23. Thousands of people have donated to the GoFundMe page since it was set up in October, raising just over half a million US dollars – almost triple its target. Cassius’ mother Mechelle Turvey was in court on Friday to hear the charges read and released a statement thanking the family’s supporters. “On behalf of Cassius loved ones we again give gratitude to everyone for their support,” the statement said. “The news of 3 others being charged is another step towards justice and healing for many.” ",330,australia,2023-01-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/20/australia/australia-cassius-turvey-murder-charges-intl-hnk/index.html

      Australian runner aims for world record with 150 marathons in 150 days
    ","Australian Erchana Murray-Bartlett completed 150 marathons in 150 days, running 6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles) from the country’s northern tip to the southern city of Melbourne in what could be a new world record. The 32-year-old runner crossed the finish line on Monday after a feat that, if confirmed, will beat the previous world record of 106 consecutive marathons set by British national Kate Jayden last year. CNN has reached out to  Guinness World Records to confirm Murray-Bartlett’s official standing. While Jayden sought to raise money for refugees, Murray-Bartlett completed her run – documented on Instagram – to raise awareness of the threats to Australia’s biodiversity. “Australia is fantastic, it’s so beautiful, and that was one of the key things I wanted to get out of this run, it was to showcase Australia’s beauty to the world – we have globally significant national parks, the Great Barrier Reef, and exploring them on foot is such a unique, different way to do it,” Murray-Bartlett told CNN affiliate Nine News. Murray-Bartlett raised more than 118,000 Australian dollars ($82,130) for the Wilderness Society, with all profits going towards conserving Australia’s native animals. Australia, which has one of the world’s worst records on extinctions, last year announced a 10-year plan to try to prevent any more species from dying out in the country. The country’s wildlife has suffered the effects of natural disasters and the climate crisis, including catastrophic bushfires in 2019-20 that killed or displaced nearly 3 billion animals, according to estimates from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). After setting off from Cape York in Queensland in August, Murray-Bartlett ran 42.2 kilometers (26.2 miles) each day, enduring scorching heat and storms as she crossed dirt roads, rivers and beaches. “It’s very exhausting, I’ll give you that but I feel very blessed have been out to get to the finish line,” she said on Monday. While Murray-Bartlett’s run took her from the country’s north to south, another Australian, Nedd Brockmann, ran almost 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) over 47 days from west to east in 2022.

      Girl, 5, saves younger brother’s life after car crash kills parents
    ","A 5-year-old girl saved her baby brother’s life after a car crash killed their parents, leaving three young children trapped in the wreckage for more than two days in a remote part of rural Western Australia, CNN affiliate Nine News reported. In a statement, Western Australia Police said the family’s Land Rover Discovery was found Tuesday morning in Kondinin, about 280 kilometers (174 miles) east of the state capital Perth. Parents Cindy Braddock, 25, and Jake Day, 28, were declared dead at the scene, police said. Their three children survived the accident, but were left trapped in the vehicle with their dead parents in searing temperatures until being discovered by a concerned family member. The family of five – including the girl and her two brothers, ages 2 and 1 – had been reported missing a day earlier when they didn’t make it to a Christmas Day celebration, Nine News reported. Relative Michael Read told Nine News the 5-year-old girl saved her youngest brother’s life by freeing him from his child seat. “If it wasn’t for the 5-year-old undoing the buckle of the 1-year-old’s car seat, he wouldn’t be with us today,” Read said. “She’ll probably not know for a few years.” Their ordeal was worsened by high temperatures, Read said. ”﻿Basically they were stuck in the car for the 55 hours in 30-degree (Celsius – about 86 Fahrenheit) heat,” he told Nine News. “Nobody knows what they went through.” The children were taken to hospital with severe dehydration, police said. They survived with non-life threatening injuries and are expected to be discharged from hospital in the coming days, Nine News reported.

      Xi makes ‘journey of friendship’ to Moscow days after Putin’s war crime warrant issued
    ","For Chinese leader Xi Jinping, his high-profile state visit to Russia and meeting with President Vladimir Putin this week is a timely opportunity to showcase China’s growing diplomatic clout on the world stage and its ambition to challenge the US-led global order. But in many Western capitals the optics of the visit will look very different – two autocrats who have long described themselves as firm friends shaking hands and banqueting while a conflagration in Europe rages. Beijing has cast the visit as a “journey of peace,” where Xi is supposed to “play a constructive role in promoting peace talks” over the war in Ukraine. After touching down in Moscow on Monday, Xi said in a statement that China is “willing to continue to work with Russia to firmly safeguard the international order.” And it comes just days after China scored a major diplomatic victory by brokering a surprise rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, helping the two archrivals restore diplomatic ties. Yet hours after the announcement of Xi’s trip on Friday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes over Moscow’s forcible deportation of Ukrainian children. China’s top leader will now be dining with a suspected war criminal whom he has called a “best friend,” and affirming his “no limits” partnership with a global pariah whose brutal invasion has killed tens of thousands of people and wreaked havoc on the global economy. For the United States and much of Europe, Xi’s visit is a stark show of support for the increasingly isolated Putin, at a time when his military is running out of supplies and Russia’s economy is struggling under Western sanctions. In recent weeks, Western officials have voiced concerns that China is considering providing lethal assistance to Russia’s military. Beijing has denied the allegation, and instead accused the US of prolonging the war by “adding fuel” to the battlefield and providing Ukraine with weapons. American officials said they would be watching intently for signs that China is moving forward with providing weapons to Russia during Xi’s summit with Putin. Ukraine is watching closely too. “We really hope that China will not become an accomplice in this horrific war,” Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to Washington, told CNN. “It’s going to be a meeting with a person who’s officially suspected by the International Criminal Court.” Xi will be walking a diplomatic tightrope in Moscow, as he seeks to present China as a neutral peace broker while deepening ties with Russia, without further antagonizing Europe – a key trade partner Beijing has sought to woo away from the US. In a signed article published in Russian state media Monday, Xi framed his upcoming visit as “a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace,” vowing to open “a new chapter” of bilateral relations. He also claimed China has “all along upheld an objective and impartial position” on Ukraine and “actively promoted peace talks.” The People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, published a letter the same day from Putin filled with praise for “Comrade Xi” and his view that Western powers will one day come for China. “It is crystal clear that NATO is striving for a global reach of activities and seeking to penetrate the Asia-Pacific,” Putin wrote. Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Xi is “hoping to use this trip to cast himself as a statesman and to portray China as a major global power and peacekeeper capable of shaping global events.” The timing of the long-anticipated meeting is no coincidence, as it allows the Chinese leader to capitalize on the momentum of Beijing’s recent diplomatic win in the Middle East to shape – or give the appearance of shaping – the trajectory of the war in Ukraine, he said. “But the war will be a much taller task. The key question is whether, and to what extent, Xi tries to use his leverage to shape Russia’s behavior in the war going forward,” Hart said. “So far, we have not seen Xi take tangible steps to try to bring the war to an end.” Despite its claims of neutrality and calls for peace talks, Beijing has offered Moscow much-needed diplomatic and economic support throughout the invasion. China has echoed Russian propaganda, accused the West of provoking the war in Ukraine and repeatedly sided with Russia in blocking international action against Moscow for the invasion. It has expanded trade links with its northern neighbor, buying vast amount of oil and energy gas at discounted prices and filling Putin’s war chest. China’s People’s Liberation Army has also continued to conduct joint military exercises with the Russian military. Days before the visit, the Russian defense military said Russia, China and Iran have completed three-way naval exercises in the Arabian Sea – sending a powerful message of defiance to the Western alliance. Beijing’s lopsided position is also apparent in its diplomatic engagements with Moscow and Ukraine – an asymmetry further highlighted by Xi’s visit to Russia. According to Hart’s tally, China’s Foreign Ministers have only talked with their Ukrainian counterparts five times since the start of the war. By comparison, Chinese officials – including Xi, his top diplomats and other senior leaders – have spoken with Russian officials 29 times. Xi has spoken to Putin four times since the invasion – including a face-to-face at a regional summit in Central Asia last September. But he has yet to hold a single phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Chinese leader’s long-anticipated visit to Moscow also comes after the release of China’s position paper on a “political settlement” to the war – a move by Beijing to boost its credentials as a potential peace broker. But the plan only generated a lukewarm reception from Moscow and Kyiv, and was widely criticized by Western officials for lacking substance – and failing even to recognize Russia’s violation of Ukraine sovereignty. For now, American and European officials have continued to view Beijing’s self-claimed role as a peace broker with skepticism and concern. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said any framework offered by Beijing would be “one sided and reflect only the Russian perspective.” “A ceasefire now is effectively the ratification of Russian conquest,” he said. “Russia would be free to use a ceasefire to only further entrench their positions in Ukraine to rebuild, refit and refresh their forces so that they can restart attacks on Ukraine at a time of their choosing.” Brian Hart, the expert at CSIS, said Xi’s visit is unlikely to have any drastic impact on the course of the Ukraine war. “Neither Moscow nor Kyiv appear ready to make the concessions needed to bring the war to an end, and that is not something Beijing can fundamentally change,” he said. “Beijing might be able to pressure Putin to make some actions that impact the war on the margins, but so far that has not happened.” ",1165,china,2023-03-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/china/china-xi-putin-russia-visit-analysis-intl-hnk-mic/index.html

      China’s Xi to meet Putin next week in first visit to Russia since invasion of Ukraine
    ","Chinese leader Xi Jinping will fly to Moscow next week to meet with President Vladimir Putin in his first visit to Russia since Putin launched his devastating invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago. The visit will be seen as a powerful show of Beijing’s support for Moscow in Western capitals, where leaders have grown increasingly wary of the two nations’ deepening partnership as war rages in Europe. It will also be Xi’s first foreign trip since securing an unprecedented third term as president at the annual meeting of China’s rubber-stamp legislature last week. The face to face was revealed on Friday by statements from both Beijing and the Kremlin. China’s Foreign Ministry said the visit will take place from Monday to Wednesday at the invitation of Putin and the war in Ukraine would be a part of the talks. “China’s proposition boils down to one sentence, which is to urge peace and promote talks,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. The Kremlin said the two leaders will discuss “topical issues of further development of comprehensive partnership relations and strategic cooperation between Russia and China.” “An exchange of views is also planned in the context of deepening Russian-Chinese cooperation in the international arena,” the Kremlin added. “A number of important bilateral documents will be signed.” The Kremlin also released the schedule of meetings planned between Xi and Putin. The two leaders will start Monday with a one-on-one followed by an “informal lunch,” with negotiations set to take place Tuesday, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. And Yuri Ushakov, the Russian president’s adviser on international relations, said that Putin and Xi will sign documents attesting to closer ties between the two nations, and plan to discuss the war in Ukraine. “Moscow highly appreciates the balanced position of the Chinese leadership,” Ushakov told Russian state media outlet TASS. “Russia and China are satisfied with the highest level of relations that continue to develop, Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow will give them a new impetus,” he added. The visit comes as China tries to present itself as a neutral peace broker on Ukraine, including the recent release of a position paper calling for a political settlement on the crisis. On Thursday, China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on the phone to call for peace talks. The two discussed “the significance of the principle of territorial integrity,” Kuleba said on Twitter. But the mediator claim has been met with skepticism by Western leaders, who point to China’s refusal to acknowledge the nature of the conflict and growing ties with Russia. Xi has spoken to Putin multiple times since the invasion – both virtually and in person, but has not had a single phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Xi and Putin declared a “no-limits” friendship in February last year, when the Russian leader visited Beijing for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. And under Xi, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion – or even refer to it as such, instead blaming NATO for provoking the conflict while amplifying Kremlin’s misinformation. It has also provided diplomatic support for Moscow, as well as strengthening economic and military ties by boosting trade and holding frequent joint military exercises. In recent weeks, Western officials have begun publicly raising concerns that China may be considering providing Russia with lethal military assistance, an accusation denied by Beijing. Last month, Putin hosted China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow just days before the anniversary of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin told Wang relations between his country and China were “reaching new milestones,” while Wang vowed to “further strengthen our comprehensive strategic partnership.” Putin and Xi last held a virtual meeting in December, in which the Russian leader described relations between the two nations as “the best in history,” saying they could “withstand all tests.” The two leaders share a deep suspicion and hostility toward the US, which they believe is bent on holding China and Russia down. They also share a vision for a new world order – one that better accommodates their nations’ interests and is no longer dominated by the West. They have also forged a close personal connection, with Xi describing Putin as a “best friend” in 2019. Xi has met Putin in person 39 times since becoming China’s leader, most recently in September during a summit in central Asia. US officials say they will be watching intently for signs that China is moving forward with providing weapons to Russia during next week’s summit. So far, officials have said there hasn’t been any indication that Beijing has made a final decision to assist Moscow’s war efforts with lethal aid, but next week’s meeting could provide a venue for such an announcement. “It’s something that we will watch for,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week. “Obviously, Russia has its own interests in trying to pull other countries into this conflict if it can, but our position is the same whether or not they meet.” The concern among US officials is not that Chinese weapons would help Russia land a decisive win in Ukraine. Instead, the worry is that lethal aid from Beijing could prolong the conflict, which US officials believe favors Putin. A drawn-out war could also benefit China if American resources and attention are consumed in Ukraine, instead of in Asia, where Beijing has become increasingly assertive militarily.

      Xi tightens grip, hardens stance on US: Key takeaways from China’s annual political meetings
    ","China’s most important annual political meetings wrapped up Monday, leaving leader Xi Jinping firmly at the helm of a superpower that appears more eager to push back against the United States than at any time in decades. Much of what took place over 10 days in Beijing at the highly choreographed meetings, known as the two sessions, was pre-arranged – but they also threw up a few surprises. Here are the key takeaways: To long-term observers of Chinese politics, the meetings sent an unequivocal message: the Chinese Communist Party is advancing and the state is in retreat. The annual meeting of the country’s rubber-stamp legislature and top political advisory body is traditionally a stage for the central government and the premier to shine. But the party – and Xi – has increasingly loomed large over the event. The National People’s Congress not only endorsed an unprecedented third term for Xi as president, but also approved his sweeping reform plan to further bolster the party’s role in all aspects of decision-making and governance. The overhaul grants the party even more direct control over the crucial financial and technology sectors – at the expense of the State Council, China’s cabinet. Under Xi, the party has increasingly eclipsed the power of the State Council, reversing efforts by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to introduce a degree of separation between the party and the state. The party – with Xi at its helm – has taken all decision-making power into its own hands, with the State Council reduced to the role of an executor. Li Qiang, China’s new premier, drove the message home Monday during his debut news conference. When asked by a reporter to outline the goals for the new term of government, Li replied: “The job of the new government is to carry out and fully implement the decisions of the party’s central committee.” Throughout the news conference, Li cited Xi seven times and the party 11 times. A notable shift in tone at the two sessions this year was a more forceful approach in publicly pushing back against the US – from the very top of the Chinese leadership. At China’s annual exercise in political theater, it is safe to assume that no public comment was made without having been carefully thought out. So when Xi lashed out at the US in front of a group of government advisers representing private businesses last week, the sharpened rhetoric sent alarm bells ringing for already fraught US-China relations. “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,” Xi said. Despite worsening bilateral relations, China’s top leader usually avoids directly attacking the US, and generally refers only to “Western countries” or “some developed nations” instead. Xi’s unusually direct remarks signal a notable escalation – one that is expected to be rigorously studied and followed by China’s entire officialdom. The next day, China’s new foreign minister Qin Gang echoed Xi’s accusation, warning that if the US doesn’t stop containing and suppressing China, the two superpowers will surely be driven toward “conflict and confrontation.” In another sign of the hardening stance, China appointed a US-sanctioned general as its new defense minister. Gen. Li Shangfu, a veteran of the People’s Liberation Army’s modernization drive, was sanctioned by the Trump administration in 2018 for buying Russian weapons, including an Su-35 combat aircraft and S-400 surface-to-air missile system. Every year on International Women’s Day, Chinese state media never fails to cite Chairman Mao Zedong’s famous quote: “Women hold up half the sky.” But the annual parliamentary meeting, which almost always coincides with the occasion, is a glaring reminder of just how few women hold high office in China. This year, the gender imbalance is even more striking, as no woman has been appointed vice-premier under Li, China’s new premier. Li’s predecessor, Li Keqiang, had one female vice-premier in his cabinet for both terms. In Li’s new cabinet, there are only three women – and 30 men. The contrast is even more stark on the party’s side. In a reversal for gender equality, not a single woman was promoted to the 24-member Politburo at the party’s leadership reshuffle in October. For the first time in 25 years, the party’s second-most powerful group and executive policymaking body is completely dominated by men. No women has ever made it into the Politburo Standing Committee – the innermost sanctum of power. In a surprise announcement on Sunday, Beijing retained some of its existing economic leadership, including People’s Bank of China governor Yi Gang, a US-educated economist, and Finance Minister Liu Kun. Both men have reached the official retirement age of 65 for ministers. Yi, who was appointed China’s central bank chief in 2018, had widely been expected to retire after being left off the party’s Central Committee at a key party congress in October. Xi shattered the party’s retirement norms in October by staying on for another term as party leader, breaking with precedents that leaders older than 68 should step down. He also made an exception for former Foreign Minister Wang Yi, promoting the 69-year-old to the Politburo. Analysts say by retaining Yi and Liu, Beijing wants to send a message of continuity and consistency as economic headwinds loom at home and abroad.

      ‘Star Wars’ actor Donnie Yen’s Communist Party ties spark Oscar host backlash
    ","A petition calling for the removal of martial arts star Donnie Yen as a presenter at this year’s Oscar ceremony due to his connections to China’s ruling Communist Party has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. The 59-year-old actor, best known for his role in ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’ and the hugely popular ‘Ip Man’ franchise, has long been a controversial figure among sections within his native Hong Kong, owing to his apparent criticism of the city’s pro-democracy movement. Describing Yen as a “supporter of the Chinese Communist regime,” the online petition points to several statements it claims ought to disqualify Yen from involvement in the 95th Academy Awards, which will be held on March 13. One example listed was a profile published last week in GQ, in which Yen discussed the large and occasionally violent pro-democracy demonstrations that gripped Hong Kong throughout 2019. “It wasn’t a protest, okay, it was a riot,” Yen told GQ of the demonstrations, which were ultimately suppressed by mass arrests and the introduction of a sweeping national security law by Beijing. Hong Kong’s government and police, as well as authorities and state media in mainland China, also refer to the demonstrations as “riots,” a phrase pro-democracy supporters reject. The petition claims Yen’s GQ remarks “not only violate the spirit of freedom of speech but also deny the rights of the people of Hong Kong to fight for their freedom and democracy.” The Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied accusations the national security law has stifled  political opposition and criminalized dissent. Instead, it says the law has restored stability to the city after the tumult of the 2019 demonstrations. The petition was created Saturday by “a group of people from Hong Kong,” according to the details provided, and has since gained more than 84,000 signatures. “If the Oscars Committee continues to invite such a person as a guest presenter, it will damage the image and reputation of the film industry and cause serious harm to human rights and moral values,” the petition reads. Last weekend, Yen was seen in attendance at a key Communist Party meeting in Beijing as part of an advisory body on arts and culture. Speaking to press at the event, Yen said more Chinese action movies were needed to “become the pride of China” and “tell the story of China,” according to state-run Global Times. The Oscars has not publicly commented on the petition. CNN has reached out to the Oscars for comment. When contacted by CNN, Yen’s representative declined to provide a statement. It’s not the first time Yen has attracted controversy among pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong. He was previously criticized after performing next to Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2017, an event Yen called a “great honor,” and for celebrating Hong Kong’s return “to motherland China” in 2020 on the anniversary of the city’s handover. These incidents prompted many in Hong Kong to call for the boycotts of his recent films – “Ip Man 4” in 2019, and “Mulan” in 2020. Yen seemed to acknowledge his critics in the GQ interview, saying: “A lot of people might not be happy for what I’m saying, but I’m speaking from my own experience.” He is set to present the Oscars ceremony alongside other prominent actors and performers including Riz Ahmed, Emily Blunt, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. ",562,china,2023-03-09,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/09/china/donnie-yen-oscars-petition-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html

      China ups diplomatic offensive with drastic increase in budget – and hardened stance on US
    ","After three years of largely self-imposed isolation on the global stage, China is aiming to up its diplomatic offensive and win back lost ground – all while hardening its public stance toward its superpower rival, the United States. Qin Gang, Beijing’s new foreign minister, on Tuesday declared that “China’s diplomacy has pressed the ‘accelerator button,’” citing the country’s recovery from the pandemic and its resumption of international exchanges. That outreach will be boosted by a 12.2% increase in the Chinese government’s budget for diplomatic expenditure this year. It’s a drastic jump from the zero-Covid era that saw China’s borders mostly shut: In 2020, China slashed its diplomacy budget by 11.8%, before a mild 2.4% increase in 2022. This year’s budget, pegged at 54.84 billion yuan (about $8 billion), remains below the pre-pandemic peak, but experts say it marks a significant increase for China to resume and expand its diplomatic engagement with the world. In comparison, in the US, the requested 2023 budget for “international affairs” listed on the State Department’s website was $67 billion. And the money will be used not only to fund diplomatic trips. According to China’s Ministry of Finance, the umbrella term “diplomatic expenditure” covers a wide range of areas, from budgets for the Foreign Ministry, Chinese embassies and consulates, to China’s participation in international organizations, foreign aid and external propaganda. Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, noted that China is likely to increase its spending on propaganda efforts targeting foreign audiences to service Beijing’s diplomatic interests – including through Chinese social media apps. “For example, they try to extend influence in different countries, such as Singapore and Malaysia, through WeChat, targeting those who speak the Chinese language,” Wu said. Experts also question whether some of the increase is due to the debt stress and repayment problems faced by countries under Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s signature overseas development initiative, known as the Belt and Road. “Even if the interest and principal repayment is suspended, it still creates a large hole,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road, and Chinese leaders will likely travel the world to talk up its successes, Sun said. “That usually means more diplomatic expenditures such as aid and gift packages,” she said. China is set to host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year, after a long delay due to the pandemic. It will also host the first in-person summit between Xi and leaders from five Central Asian countries. “China wishes to catch up and do more to make up for the lost time and opportunities,” Sun said. And China has a lot of catching up to do, at least in terms of stabilizing relations with developed countries. Global surveys by the Pew Research Center have shown that public opinion toward China in advanced economies has turned “precipitously more negative” since 2017, due to concerns about Beijing’s human rights record and military buildup in the South China Sea, with the most dramatic declines between 2019 and 2020. Since the pandemic, opinions have only deteriorated further, partly due to perceptions that China had mishandled the initial Covid outbreak in Wuhan, according to a Pew survey published last year. A notable shift in China’s diplomatic endeavors is a more forceful approach in publicly pushing back against the US – from the very top of the Chinese leadership. In unusually direct remarks Monday, Xi accused the US of leading a campaign to suppress China and causing its serious domestic woes. “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,” Xi told a group of government advisers representing private businesses on the sidelines of an annual legislative meeting in Beijing. China’s top leader usually avoids directly attacking the US in public even as bilateral relations have deteriorated sharply. He generally refers only to “Western countries” or “some developed nations” when making critical comments about Washington. Xi’s blunt rebuke of US policy was echoed Tuesday by Qin, the foreign minister, who said US competition with China is in fact all about “containment and suppression” and “a zero-sum game of life and death.” “If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” Qin warned. To longtime observers of Chinese politics, the sharpened rhetoric rings alarm bells for already tense US-China relations, with no off-ramp in sight for deescalation. “It sure feels like the (Chinese) side has decided to level up in responding much more forcefully to what it sees as unfair US accusations and actions,” wrote Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter. Now that Xi – the most powerful Chinese leader in decades – has lashed out at the US directly, China’s entire officialdom and propaganda machine are expected to take note and rigorously follow. Temperatures are not likely to cool in Washington, either, given the consensus across the aisle to be tough on China and hardening American public perceptions. According to a Gallup poll released Tuesday, a record-low 15% of Americans view China favorably in 2023, a 5% fall from last year and a 38% decrease since 2018. More than eight in 10 US adults now hold a negative opinion of China, the poll said. “Expect US-China to get worse faster,” Bishop wrote. “I fear we are entering into a much more dangerous period in US-China relations.” Since late last year, some observers have noted Beijing’s softening tone on foreign affairs as it upped its diplomacy with Western governments, following Xi’s flurry of meetings with Western leaders at the G20 summit in Indonesia. The demotion of combative foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian and the promotion of Qin – a measured former ambassador to the US – to foreign minister had been seen by some as a signal China was moving away from “wolf warrior” diplomacy, the aggressive style adopted by Beijing’s envoys in recent years. When asked about that perceived shift Tuesday, Qin criticized “wolf warrior” diplomacy as a “narrative trap.” “Those who coined the term and set the trap either know little about China and its diplomacy, or have a hidden agenda in disregard of facts,” Qin said. “In China’s diplomacy, there is no shortage of goodwill and kindness. But if faced with jackals or wolves, Chinese diplomats would have no choice but to confront them head-on and protect our motherland.” To Sun, the expert at Stimson Center, the tone of Qin’s remarks did not come as a surprise – it simply aligns with China’s established lines on foreign policy, she said. “I think it is assertive and spiky, but not as aggressive as wolf warrior diplomacy was.” Wu, the expert in Singapore, meanwhile, said he hadn’t observed much of a mellowing in Beijing’s diplomatic outreach. “Qin Gang may be a bit softer than Wang Yi,” he said, referring to Qin’s predecessor who was recently promoted as Xi’s top foreign policy adviser. “But Wang is the No.1 official in diplomacy. They are still following Xi’s instruction to show their ‘fighting spirits’ – to go out proactively to fight hostile forces against China.” ",1232,china,2023-03-08,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/china/china-budget-diplomatic-expenditure-intl-hnk/index.html

      China’s new foreign minister warns of conflict with US, defends Russia ties
    ","China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned Tuesday that “conflict and confrontation” with the United States is inevitable if Washington does not change course, delivering a stern and wide-ranging rebuke of US policies for his first press conference in the new role. Qin, who was until recently China’s ambassador to the US, built up a reputation for being careful and accomplished diplomat while overseas. But he struck a far more combative tone in his first appearance as foreign minister at China’s annual parliamentary meeting, warning of the “catastrophic consequences” of what he described as a “reckless gamble” by Washington in how it treats its fellow superpower. “If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” Qin said on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress in Beijing. At the highly scripted event, Qin set the tone for China’s foreign policy for the coming year and beyond, berating the US for rising bilateral tensions and defending Beijing’s close partnership with Moscow. Ties between the world’s two largest economies are at their worst in decades, and tensions soared further last month after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated over North America and was then shot down by US fighter jets. On Tuesday, Qin accused the US of overreacting in its response, which he said created “a diplomatic crisis that could have been avoided.” The incident, Qin said, shows “the US perception and views of China are seriously distorted. It regards China as its primary rival and the biggest geopolitical challenge.” “The US claims it seeks to compete with China but does not seek conflict. But in reality, the so-called ‘competition’ by the US is all-round containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death,” he said. “Containment and suppression will not make America great, and the US will not stop the rejuvenation of China,” Qin said. The great power rivalry between the US and China has intensified in recent years. Under leader Xi Jinping, China has become increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive abroad, taking a more aggressive approach to exert its influence and counter the West. And Washington has pushed back. Under the Biden administration, the US has shored up ties with allies and partners to contain Beijing’s rising influence, including in its backyard. It has also pushed to decouple from China in emerging technologies, recently banning the export of advanced chips to the fury of Beijing. Qin lashed out at Washington for its Indo-Pacific strategy, accusing it of forming exclusive blocks to provoke confrontation, advocating for decoupling and plotting an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO.” “The real purpose of the Indo-Pacific strategy is to contain China,” Qin said. “No Cold War should be repeated in Asia, and no Ukraine-style crisis should be repeated in Asia.” China’s refusal to condemn Russia for the invasion of Ukraine and its growing partnership with Moscow have further strained its relations with the West. While Beijing has sought to cast itself as a neutral peace broker, it has also defended its “rock-solid” ties with Russia. On Tuesday Qin said the Sino-Russian relationship “does not pose a threat to any country in the world, nor will it be interfered or sowed discord in by any third party.” “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations,” he said. Qin highlighted the issue of Taiwan as the “bedrock of the political foundation of Sino-US relations and the first red line that must not be crossed.” The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and refuses to rule out the use of force to “reunify” it with mainland China. On Tuesday, Qin urged the US not to “interfere in China’s internal affairs” and questioned Washington’s different responses to the issues of Ukraine and Taiwan. “Why does the US talk up respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Ukraine issue, but does not respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on the issue of Taiwan? Why does the US ask China not to provide weapons to Russia while keeps selling arms to Taiwan?” Qin said. Qin’s remarks come amid reports of a potential meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April. The Financial Times reported Monday that Tsai could meet McCarthy in California, rather than in Taiwan as the US Speaker had initially indicated. A US State Department spokesperson said Monday he was “not aware of any confirmed travel” by the Taiwanese President, and Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it had no information to share regarding any potential US visit. However, regardless of the location, a face to face between Tsai and a senior US politician will most certainly draw the ire of Beijing, fueling even more tensions in already tense relations across the Taiwan Strait – and between US and China. Defying Beijing’s threats of retaliation, McCarthy’s Democratic predecessor Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August in the first trip by a US Speaker in 25 years. Beijing responded by staging unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan and cutting off key lines of communication with the US. China’s Foreign Ministry has since warned McCarthy not to visit Taiwan. Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Program, said Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy in California is not necessarily a “replacement or downgrade.” Instead, it could be an “add-on,” he said, suggesting McCarthy could always visit Taiwan at a later date. While Taiwan wants to normalize high-level visits by American officials to Taiwan, it also needs to be seen by its Western partners that it is being a responsible stakeholder in the process. “Some may think that there is better timing than this current moment to be pursing another US speaker visit to Taiwan,” Sung said. A meeting in the US, he added, could serve as “a very visual deliverable in the short term to show continued US support for Taiwan, regardless of change of party leadership in the legislature.” Tsai has transited in the US before on her visits to Taipei’s diplomatic allies. She last visited the US in 2019 and gave a speech in New York – a trip that angered Beijing. To China, Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy will be provocative no matter where it takes place, Sung said. “Beijing is going to be very unhappy and protest vigorously regardless. So I guess for them it will be a difference in intensity, but not a difference in kind. Beijing won’t like any such high level exchange be it taking place on Taiwan or US soil.” ",1121,china,2023-03-07,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/china/china-two-sessions-new-foreign-minister-us-rebuke-intl-hnk/index.html

      Yao Ming caught in the cross-fire as Chinese basketball team leaves top league on eve of Covid reopening
    ","The return of China’s top basketball league to its normal season format following years of Covid disruptions has been marred in controversy after an abrupt no-show from one of its former championship-winning teams amid accusations of mistreatment by its star player. The squabble has sparked a headache for Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) boss – and former NBA star – Yao Ming and is the latest public spat to engulf a major league. The Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers on Tuesday announced its withdrawal from the CBA after the league slapped it with a one-year suspension from acquiring and registering new players. Guanghui, which is based in China’s western Xinjiang region, was slated to join other teams on Wednesday for the first matches after a mid-season break. But in a tersely-worded a statement this week the team accused the league of being “full of chaos” and publicly rebuked Yao’s leadership. At the heart of the fallout between Guanghui and the league is China national team star Zhou Qi, who is himself now publicly feuding with his own team. Following an internal investigation, the CBA deemed Guanghui to have committed “registration violations” in the signing of Zhou in February. This included transferring business operations without formal approval, and not being in accordance with the league’s hiring and salary regulations over the last three seasons. The result of that investigation has since ignited a full-blown rift between Zhou and his team. Most explosive are his accusations of bullying by team manager Guo Jian and club president Hou Wei, who according to Zhou went back on their word and hindered him from participating in NBA events in the US. He provided photos and screenshots of documents supposedly backing up all of his claims. “The two chairmans, Guo Jian and Hou Wei, and the management, have bullied me and lied to me for many years. I couldn’t bear it. I still couldn’t decide my own future as an adult in 2023,” Zhou wrote in a lengthy post on Chinese social media platform Weibo. CNN has reached out to the team for comment. Zhou has long been touted as Yao’s successor as a generational talent given his towering seven-foot-one (216 centimeters) height and previous experience playing with NBA team Houston Rockets — the same team that Yao was drafted to in 2002. This would have been Zhou’s third stint with the Flying Tigers, having played between 2014-2017 and 2019-2021. The saga has sparked heavy interest on China’s social media, where fans have flocked to discuss how Yao would react to the scandal and theories on who is ultimately to blame. “There are no winners from this” and “the biggest victims are the fans” were among the most-liked comments. More angry users have rounded on Yao and described the furore as a “nuclear explosion in the basketball world”. CNN has reached out to the CBA for comment. Basketball commands a huge following in China primarily thanks to Yao’s Hall of Fame career in the NBA. NBA viewership last year nearly returned to the levels seen before Chinese broadcasters’ 16-month blackout in 2019, according to Reuters. That is an estimated 500 to 800 million viewers through the season. The CBA, though comparatively less popular, did see pre-Covid audience increases since Yao took charge in 2017. In its statement Guanghui argues that the CBA “made serious mistakes in its unreasonable and absurd ‘punishment’”. “After careful consideration, (Guanghui) has solemnly decided to: stop playing this season; and quit the CBA,” it said. The team then took aim at Yao and the CBA of mismanagement, and Zhou for allegedly repeatedly discrediting the team. “Since 2017, Yao Ming has held the position of both chairman of the Association and the League. The management of each are intertwined and confused, and the basketball industry is full of chaos,” Guanghui said. Even after retirement Yao has remained one of China’s most recognisable international faces, acting as a prominent ambassador for sports and fronting a number of charitable causes including campaigns against the ivory trade and consuming shark fins. Commenting on the Flying Tiger’s withdrawal, Yao told the state-run China National Radio on Wednesday that the Xinjiang club had made “huge contributions” to Chinese basketball in the past 20 years. “We respect its decision and express regret,” Yao said. “Our top priority now is to bring the league and the games back to the fans.” Zhou also responded to Guanhui’s broadside with in a lengthy statement of his own on Weibo, calling the revelations “fake news.” “I admire the ‘creativity’ of (Guanghui) regarding the violations. Sadly, it has been unable to turn around on its road of deception. It’s gone further downhill”. He concluded that the CBA’s penalty on Xinjiang “is fair and objective”. Xinjiang, alongside then-All Star Zhou, won their first and only CBA Championship in 2017. Guanghui’s withdrawal comes one week after soccer team Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard FC withdrew from China’s League One division after dissolving. The next most popular sport after basketball, Chinese soccer is reeling from its own post-Covid financial difficulties as well as a crackdown on corruption at the highest administrative levels. A total of six clubs from its marquee Chinese Super League withdrew – and folded – during the pandemic, with dozens more across all divisions. Many of those who remain are struggling to pay the salaries of players and staff – some even filing appeals to world governing body FIFA. Meanwhile, a former national team head coach, former national team director, and former Chinese Football Association secretary-general are under investigation by China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection for suspected “serious violations of party discipline and the law”.

      China calls for Russia-Ukraine ceasefire as claims to neutrality questioned
    ","China has reiterated its calls for a political settlement to the Ukraine conflict on the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion, as Beijing comes under increasing pressure from the United States and its allies over its growing partnership with Moscow. In a newly released position paper Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry called for a resumption of peace talks, an end to unilateral sanctions, and stressed its opposition to the use of nuclear weapons – a stance Chinese leader Xi Jinping communicated to Western leaders last year. The 12-point document is part of Beijing’s latest efforts to present itself as a neutral peace broker, as it struggles to balance its “no-limits” relationship with Moscow and fraying ties with the West as the war drags on. “Conflict and war benefit no one. All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiraling out of control,” the paper said. Beijing’s claim to neutrality has been severely undermined by its refusal to acknowledge the nature of the conflict – it has so far avoided calling it an “invasion” – and its diplomatic and economic support for Moscow. Western officials have also raised concerns that China may be considering providing Russia with lethal military assistance, an accusation denied by Beijing. The policy document reiterates many of China’s standard talking points, which include urging both sides to resume peace talks. “Dialogue and negotiation are the only viable solution to the Ukraine crisis,” it said, adding that China will play a “constructive role,” without offering details. And despite claiming the “sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld,” the document fails to acknowledge Russia’s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. Moscow and Kyiv have both showed some interest in the position paper, but their responses on Friday also emphasized the enormous obstacles to dialogue. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it “highly appreciates the sincere desire” of China to contribute to settling the conflict, and added that Moscow is open to achieving the goals of its so-called special military operation through political and diplomatic means, including the recognition of “new territorial realities” – something which Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has sworn never to concede. Zelensky appeared open to speaking with China, telling a Friday news conference that he was pleased China was beginning to talk about how to end Ukraine’s conflict with Russia – but asked what steps might follow Beijing’s words. He said that China talked about territorial integrity in general terms but had not specified any country, adding that Ukraine needed to work on these issues with China. “It doesn’t say whose territorial integrity but our country’s territorial integrity has been violated,” Zelensky said. When asked how he would bring countries geopolitically removed from Ukraine onto his side, Zelensky said: “As far as I know, China respects territorial integrity, historically, has respected it and therefore must do whatever they can for the Russian Federation to leave our territory because that would mean respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Much of the language used in the document appears targeted at the West. In a thinly veiled criticism of the United States, the paper said, “Cold War mentality” should be abandoned. “The security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs. The legitimate security interests and concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and addressed properly,” it said, apparently echoing Moscow’s view the West provoked the war through the expansion of NATO. It also appears to criticize the wide-ranging economic sanctions imposed by the US and other Western countries on Russia. “Unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure cannot solve the issue; they only create new problems,” it said. “Relevant countries should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ against other countries, so as to do their share in deescalating the Ukraine crisis.” The paper was swiftly criticized by American officials, with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan saying the war “could end tomorrow if Russia stopped attacking Ukraine and withdrew its forces.” “My first reaction to it is that it could stop at point one, which is to respect the sovereignty of all nations,” Sullivan told CNN. “Ukraine wasn’t attacking Russia. NATO wasn’t attacking Russia. The United States wasn’t attacking Russia. This was a war of choice waged by Putin.” In Beijing, the ambassador of the European Union to China, Jorge Toledo, told reporters at a briefing that China’s position paper was not a peace proposal, adding that the EU is “studying the paper closely,” according to Reuters. Ukraine, meanwhile, called the position paper “a good sign” but urged China to do more. “China should do everything in its power to stop the war and restore peace in Ukraine and urge Russia to withdraw its troops,” Ukraine’s Chargé d’Affaires to China Zhanna Leshchynska said at the same briefing in Beijing. “In neutrality, China should talk to both sides: Russia and Ukraine, and now we can see China is not talking to Ukraine,” she said, noting that Kyiv was not consulted before the release of the paper. The position paper was first discussed last week by top diplomat Wang Yi at a security conference in Munich, as he attempted to cast Beijing as a responsible negotiator for peace during a diplomatic charm offensive in Europe. Wang visited Moscow as the final stop of his European tour, and met with Putin on Wednesday. Putin, who welcomed Wang with outstretched arms as the Chinese diplomat entered the meeting room, said relations between Russia and China were “reaching new milestones.” “Russian-Chinese relations are developing as we planned in previous years. Everything is moving forward and developing,” Putin told reporters as he sat beside Wang. “Cooperation in the international arena between the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China, as we have repeatedly said, is very important for stabilizing the international situation.” Wang said the two countries “often face crisis and chaos, but there are always opportunities in a crisis.” “This requires us to identify changes more voluntarily and respond to the changes more actively to further strengthen our comprehensive strategic partnership,” Wang said.

      Death toll rises in China mine collapse as rescue efforts continue
    ","Search and rescue operations continued in northern China Thursday, after a collapsed coal mine left at least five dead and dozens trapped. Chinese state media reported that six were injured and 48 people remain missing as of Thursday evening. The incident took place Wednesday in Alxa League in Inner Mongolia when a 180-meter (590-foot) tall slope gave way above the open-pit mine, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The rescue operation was halted overnight due to a massive landslide near the site Wednesday evening, with efforts still blocked as of early Thursday morning – though state media reported in the afternoon that operations were “ongoing.” More than 470 rescue workers have been working at the scene, alongside 40 medical workers, team leader Wei Zhiguo told CCTV from the scene. An additional 200-member team has also been mobilized, he said. Firefighters, rescue dogs and trucks have also been mobilized from across the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. “I had just started work at 1:15 in the afternoon when I realised that rocks were falling from the mountain,” one hospitalized miner told CCTV on Thursday, as quoted by Reuters. “I saw that the situation was getting more and more serious, and an evacuation was organized, but it was too late, the mountain just collapsed.” “We must make every possible effort to rescue the missing persons and treat the injured,” said Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for an immediate investigation into the cause of the accident, according to the news agency. The collapsed coal mine is owned by Xinjing Coal Mining Company and is located in the town of Alxa League.

      Putin and China’s top diplomat pledge to strengthen ties ahead of Ukraine war anniversary
    ","Russian President Vladimir Putin said relations between his country and China are “reaching new milestones” as Beijing’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, wrapped up a visit to Moscow on Wednesday. “Russian-Chinese relations are developing as we planned in previous years. Everything is moving forward and developing,” Putin told reporters as he sat beside Wang. “Cooperation in the international arena between the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China, as we have repeatedly said, is very important for stabilizing the international situation.” Wang added that the two countries “often face crisis and chaos, but there are always opportunities in a crisis.” “This requires us to identify changes more voluntarily and respond to the changes more actively to further strengthen our comprehensive strategic partnership,” Wang said. Wang’s high-profile visit, just days before the anniversary of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, is widely believed to be a precursor to a meeting between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In December 2022, Putin and Xi held a virtual meeting in which the Russian leader described relations between the two nations as “the best in history,” saying they could “withstand all tests,” and invited Xi to visit Moscow in the spring of 2023. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the two leaders would meet in “the coming months,” citing people familiar with the plan. Arrangements for the trip are at an “early stage” and the timing has not been finalized, the WSJ reported, adding that the trip could be in April or early May. Wang arrived in Moscow just days after US officials went public with concerns about how China’s continuing partnership with Russia could have an impact on the war in Ukraine — and hours after Putin made a major speech on the conflict, in which he announced plans to suspend Russia’s involvement in its last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. The Chinese diplomat held several high-profile meetings in the Russian capital during his visit, speaking with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier Wednesday and Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s Security Council and one of Putin’s closest allies, on Tuesday. Wang told Lavrov he expects the two countries to reach a “new consensus” on advancing bilateral relations. “Today I am willing to further exchange views with you, my old friend, on the advancement of our mutual relationship, and I think we will definitely reach new consensus,” Wang told Lavrov on Wednesday. “No matter how the international situation changes, China has been and remains willing to maintain the positive trend with Russia in building a new type of cooperative relationship between major powers.” Wang, who was congratulated by Lavrov for his recent promotion as the top foreign policy adviser for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, said he would endeavor to “strengthen and deepen the Sino-Russian friendship” no matter what. Wang said under the leadership of Xi and Putin, the two countries had maintained their strategic determination, and – in an apparent dig at the United States – “resolutely oppose any unilateral or bullying behavior, and unswervingly safeguard their respective sovereignty, security and development interests.” On Tuesday, Wang told Patrushev that Beijing’s ties with Moscow are “solid as a rock.” “Sino-Russian relations are mature and solid as a rock, and will withstand the test of the changing international situation,” Wang was quoted as saying by Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik. “We are ready, together with the Russian side, in accordance with top-level agreements, to resolutely defend national interests and dignity, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas,” Wang said. Patrushev told Wang that China and Russia should stick together in face of growing pressure from the West, citing what he falsely described as “the bloody events unleashed by the West in Ukraine” as an example. Russia has repeatedly accused the West of instigating the war in Ukraine, while attempting to deny responsibility for the reported deaths of tens of thousands of people — and Beijing has parroted the messaging, laying the blame for Moscow’s unprovoked invasion on the United States and its NATO allies. “In the context of the campaign by the collective West to contain Russia and China, the further deepening of Russian-Chinese coordination and interaction in the international arena carries particular importance,” Patrushev was quoted as saying by Sputnik. Patrushev also said that Russia and China should seek to create a new, “more just” world order, one that challenges the unipolar hegemony of the collective West, according to Sputnik. A readout from China’s Foreign Ministry said the two officials agreed to oppose “the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and ideological opposition” — a thinly veiled criticism of the US — and to make more efforts to “improve global governance,” in an apparent reference to Beijing and Moscow’s ambitions to reshape the global order in their favor. Wang and Patrushev also “exchanged their opinions” on the issue of Ukraine, the statement added, without offering details. Wang’s trip comes after US President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday in a show of support for the embattled country, which Washington and its European allies have rallied together to back over the past year through both military and humanitarian aid, and economic sanctions against Russia. The Chinese leadership has claimed impartiality in the conflict but refused to condemn Russia’s invasion, instead expanding trade ties and continuing large-scale joint military exercises, including this week. But during engagements in European cities in recent days, Wang attempted to present China as a proponent of peace and negotiation, saying at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Saturday that Beijing would release its position on a “political settlement” of the crisis. Those remarks were met with suspicion from many Western leaders who are closely watching for any support China lends to its northern neighbor, especially amid concerns that Beijing is considering the provision of lethal military aid to Russia. On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang reiterated Beijing’s messaging on Ukraine at a security forum in the Chinese capital. China was “deeply concerned” the conflict would spiral “out of control,” and would continue to urge peace talks and provide “Chinese wisdom” to bring about a political settlement, he said. “At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,” he said, in an apparent reference to the US and its allies.

      China’s top diplomat visits Moscow ahead of anniversary of Russia’s Ukraine invasion
    ","China’s top diplomat Wang Yi arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, in the first visit to Russia by a Chinese official in that role since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began nearly a year ago. Wang, who was named Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top foreign policy adviser last month, is making the high-profile visit as the final stop in an eight-day international tour that included visits to France, Italy, and Hungary, as well as Germany for a security conference. He will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, Russian state media TASS reported, citing the Russian foreign ministry. While neither country has specified whether Wang will hold talks with President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that “we do not exclude” such a meeting. Wang met with the head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, on Tuesday, according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry. The readout said the two officials agreed to oppose “the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and ideological opposition” – a thinly veiled criticism of the US – and to make more efforts to “improve global governance,” in an apparent reference to Beijing and Moscow’s ambitions to reshape the global order in their favor.

The Chinese leadership has claimed impartiality in the conflict but refused to condemn Russia’s invasion, instead expanding trade ties and continuing joint military exercises, including this week. But during engagements in European cities in recent days, Wang built on China’s framing of itself as a proponent of peace and negotiation, saying at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Saturday that Beijing would release its position on a “political settlement” of the crisis. Those remarks were met with suspicion from some Western leaders who are closely watching for any support China lends to its northern neighbor, especially that which crosses certain “red lines” articulated by Washington. On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang reiterated Beijing’s messaging on Ukraine at a security forum in the Chinese capital. China was “deeply concerned” the conflict would spiral “out of control,” and would continue to urge peace talks and provide “Chinese wisdom” to bring about a political settlement, he said. “At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,” he said, in an apparent reference to the US and its allies. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration had concerns that Beijing is considering stepping up its partnership with Moscow by supplying the Russian military with “lethal support” as Russia prepares for an expected new offensive. “We’ve been watching this very closely,” Blinken told CBS’ “Face the Nation” from the MSC in an interview that aired Sunday. “The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.” Blinken also warned Wang “about the implications and consequences” if China increases its support for Russia’s war effort, during a meeting between the two on the sidelines of the conference, according to a US readout. A senior State Department official told reporters that Blinken “was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion.” US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN earlier Saturday that the US has recently begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines in China’s support for Russia’s military and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught. Those officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners in Munich over the last several days. At the MSC, Wang said China was “deeply concerned” by the extended crisis and was not adding “fuel to the fire” – a phrase Beijing’s diplomats have used in the past to accuse the US of perpetuating the conflict. China’s Foreign Ministry on Monday said the US, not China, was the one sending a “steady stream of weapons to the battlefield.” Wang did not mention the trip to Russia during his prepared remarks or a following live-streamed conversation Saturday on the main stage of the Munich conference, when he was asked by MSC Foundation Council President Wolfgang Ischinger if China was prepared to act on “its position that it respects the territorial integrity” of Ukraine and if so, how. In meetings with European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, during the earlier phase of his tour last week, Wang stressed China’s commitment to peace talks and an end to the war. The tour was seen as part of China’s bid to bolster its ties with Europe, where analysts say Beijing’s image has been damaged in the past year due to its ties with Moscow. A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry said last Monday that Wang’s visit to Moscow would provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and “exchange views” on “international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest” – a catch-all phrase often used to allude to topics including the war in Ukraine. “China is ready to take this visit as an opportunity and work with Russia to promote steady growth of bilateral relations in the direction identified by the two heads of state, defend the legitimate rights and interests of both sides, and play an active role for world peace,” the spokesman said. Wang’s visit may also foreshadow a state visit by Xi to Moscow later this year. Putin extended an invitation to Xi during a customary end-of-year call between the two leaders, but China’s Foreign Ministry has yet to confirm any plans. In an editorial Tuesday, state-run nationalist tabloid the Global Times hailed the friendship between China and Russia as “a positive asset of the world,” and accused some in the West of attempting to use the conflict in Ukraine to “hijack” Sino-Russian relations. “The United States has viewed the friendly relations between China and Russia with thick tinted glasses from the very beginning,” it said. “In fact, no matter whether the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out, the US does not want to see China and Russia develop close relations. The suspicion, provocation and sabotage from Washington have never ceased.” ",1225,china,2023-02-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/china/china-wang-yi-russia-moscow-visit-intl-hnk/index.html

      NATO chief says Ukraine’s ‘rightful place’ is in the alliance, but Kyiv likely won’t join any time soon
    ","NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” in his strongest remarks reaffirming ties with Kyiv since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. In his first visit to Ukraine since the invasion began, Stoltenberg said he discussed a “multiyear support initiative” with President Volodymyr Zelensky, adding that it would help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era equipment and doctrines to “NATO standards.” This would “ensure full interoperability with the alliance,” Stoltenberg remarked. Even though Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, and NATO has insisted that it is not a party to the conflict, the bloc has played a critical role in supporting Kyiv, donating billions in military aid and other support. The NATO chief said that since last February, the alliance’s allies have delivered more than 150 billion euros ($165 billion) of support, including 65 billion euros of military aid. “Allies are now delivering more jets, tanks and armored vehicles,” Stoltenberg said. “NATO stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes.” Part of Russia’s premise for its invasion of Ukraine was to fend off NATO from expanding close to its borders. Finland’s accession to the alliance earlier this month marked a major shift in the security landscape in northeastern Europe, more than doubling NATO’s frontier with Russia. Finnish public support for accession snowballed following the invasion of Ukraine, and also reignited calls from Kyiv to join. Speaking at a joint conference in Kyiv, Zelensky said he valued the support from the alliance but pressed Stoltenberg on when Ukraine would be invited to join NATO. “We need something more than the kind of relationship we are having now,” Zelensky said on Thursday. “We will be in their alliance, we believe that is a guarantee of Ukraine’s security and a concrete guarantee.” “But while we await the membership and are not a member, we want to have very specific guarantees of security approved in Vilnius, if there is an opportunity to do that then we will be ready on our side.” NATO has an open-door policy, meaning that any country can be invited to join if it expresses an interest, as long as it is able and willing to uphold the principles of the alliance’s founding treaty. However, under the accession rules, any member state can veto a country from joining if they deem that the country doesn’t meet the standards required to join the alliance. These standards include being able to demonstrate a “functioning democratic political system based on a market economy” and “the fair treatment of minority populations,” according to NATO’s website, along with other things that are more difficult to demonstrate during wartime. Ukraine’s membership would also raise questions about the most important aspect of NATO: the alliance’s security guarantee. Under Article 5 of its treaty, NATO members accept the premise that an attack on one is an attack on all. The nation under attack can invoke Article 5, in theory compelling the rest of the alliance to come to their aid. Given Ukraine is currently at war, this would likely mean an almost certain immediate invocation of Article 5, putting NATO at war with Russia. No one in the alliance wants this to happen – some because they fear what an escalation would mean in terms of starting an effective world war, others because they still have certain ties with Russia. In December, nine Central and Eastern European countries from the alliance signaled their support for Ukraine’s membership, while other members have so far refrained from backing Kyiv’s bid. Stoltenberg said the topic of Ukraine’s NATO membership and security guarantees will be “high on the agenda” at July’s NATO summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, but he stopped short of confirming the country’s accession. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO. All allies agree on that,” Stoltenberg said, adding that the main focus of the alliance now is “to ensure that Ukraine prevails.” NATO’s expansion in northern Europe has dealt a major blow to President Vladimir Putin’s military campaign, with the Kremlin reiterating on Thursday that preventing Kyiv from joining NATO is one of its key goals. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday Ukraine’s accession would “pose a serious and significant danger to our country, to the security of our country.” Earlier this month, the Kremlin said it would scale up forces near Finland after the Nordic nation joined the alliance, warning that it will not bring more stability to Europe. Before Finland’s accession, Russia shared about 1,215 kilometers (755 miles) of land border with five NATO members. But the expansion added some 1,300 kilometers (830 miles) to the alliance’s frontier with Russia.

    ","Russia has a fleet of suspected spy ships operating in Nordic waters as part of a program for the potential sabotage of underwater cables and wind farms in the region, according to a joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. The broadcasters used data analysis, intercepted radio communications and intelligence sources to show how around 50 boats had been gathering intelligence for the past 10 years, using underwater surveillance equipment to map key sites for potential sabotage, Norway’s NRK and Sweden’s SVT reported. The Russian vessels have been sailing past military training areas, important oil and gas fields, small airports, deep-water quays, and strategically important hubs for the Norwegian Armed Forces, according to NRK. The investigation also said Russian ships appear suddenly following NATO exercises. Norway and Denmark are founding members of NATO, while Finland joined earlier this month – to Moscow’s displeasure – and Sweden is seeking to follow suit. One ship at the center of the investigation, the Admiral Vladimirsky, is officially used for underwater research expeditions, but is, according to the report, a Russian spy ship. The broadcasters tracked the boat’s movements and found it had traveled for a month through Nordic waters with its transmitter turned off to remain hidden, sailing close to wind farms, as well as through naval training areas of the Swedish Armed Forces, SVT reported. When a TV crew from Danish public broadcaster DR approached the ship on the sea between Sweden and Denmark, a masked man emerged on deck who appeared to be wearing body armor and armed with an assault rifle, with the incident caught on camera. The investigation also said that the Russian fishing vessel Taurus, which delivered fish to Norway between 2015 and 2022, has appeared in unusual places, heading straight towards military firing ranges and close to military bases where all naval traffic is prohibited. In one case, it appears Taurus had stopped fishing and gone directly to the city of Ålesund, passing by a major NATO exercise in the region of Trøndelag, NRK reported. Russia on Wednesday denied the accusations in the report, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov describing them as “baseless,” when asked for comment by CNN. “We see it very clearly now. Russia says cooperation with the West is over, now it is confrontation,” the head of the Norwegian Intelligence Service, Nils Andreas Stensønes, told NRK in response to the report. The Norwegian Intelligence Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CNN. The investigation comes after Dutch intelligence officials warned Russia had tried to gain intelligence to prepare for the potential sabotage of critical infrastructure in their patch of the North sea. “We saw a couple of months ago that Russian ships, a Russian ship, wanted to enter the area where Dutch windmill parks in the North Sea are located with the intention to see how the command and control structure of these windmill farms, how it is operated,” Jan Swillens, head of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), told reporters. “So that was a threat … It was the first time that we saw a Russian vessel enter the area of the windmill farms to do their reconnaissance.” Royal Norwegian Naval Academy researcher Ståle Ulriksen, who has been assisting with the investigation, told NRK he believes there could be more than 50 Russian spy ships in Nordic waters. “We are talking about a very large system. Quite a large fleet. Altogether, we are talking several hundred,” he was quoted as saying. The first of several reports will be broadcast Wednesday on DR in Denmark, NRK in Norway, SVT in Sweden and Yle in Finland. Diplomatic tensions between Moscow and Helsinki have been heightened following Finland’s accession to the alliance. The country scrapped its longstanding position of neutrality to become a NATO member as domestic support for joining the alliance surged following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The accession marked a major shift in the security landscape in northeastern Europe, adding some 1,300 kilometers (830 miles) to the alliance’s frontier with Russia. At the time, Moscow warned that further NATO expansion would not bring more stability to Europe, and said it would scale up forces near Finland if the alliance sent any troops or equipment to the new member country.

      Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich denied detention appeal in Moscow
    ","Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was on Tuesday denied an appeal to change the terms of his detention on espionage charges at a court hearing in Moscow. The US citizen was arrested in Russia last month in a sign of the Kremlin’s crackdown on foreign media news outlets since it invaded Ukraine last year. Gershkovich is currently being held in a pre-trial detention center at the notorious Lefortovo prison until May 29. He faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal has vehemently denied the spying accusations against Gershkovich. He appeared in Moscow City Court to ask that his pre-trial detention be under house arrest rather than in jail. He was pictured standing in a glass cage, standing with arms folded as journalists scrambled into the room. Gershkovich was smiling at times, in his glass cage, as proceedings were about to get underway. During the hearing, he told the judge that he did not need the decision of his appeal translated into English. “No no, I don’t need translation,” said Gershkovich, who is a bilingual Russian-English speaker. “On April 18, 2023, the Moscow City Court upheld the decision of the Lefortovsky District Court of Moscow dated March 30, 2023 against Evan Gershkovich, who is suspected of committing a crime under Art. 276 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,” the court said in a statement. Gershkovich’s legal team said it offered bail amounting to about $613,000 to the court to release the reporter from detention, but the court denied bail. “We suggested that the court consider the choice of preventive measures not related to isolation from society, including house arrest, since Evan has a registration in the territory of Moscow; or a ban on certain actions; or a bail in the amount of 50 million rubles,” lawyer Maria Korchagina said. “Dow Jones, the owner of the WSJ, provided a letter of guarantee that if Evan is released from custody, they are ready to provide bail in the amount of 50 million rubles. But our request was denied,” she added. The US Ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, was photographed standing to the right of the cage with lawyers. Tracy said she spoke to Gershkovich on Monday, and he remains strong and is in good health. “The charges against Evan are baseless, and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately release him,” she said, speaking after the court made its ruling on Tuesday. Members of the press filmed Gershkovich and subsequently left the court room. Tatyana Nozkhkina, a lawyer for Gershkovich, said later that his team will keep appealing against the detention of the reporter. The next court date is at the end of May, when the court is due to decide on an extension of his detention. Nozkhkina said her client was keeping in good spirits in jail, reading Russian classic novels as well as watching cooking shows on TV and exercising. “He does not complain,” she said outside the court. Gershkovich’s arrest marked the first detention of an American reporter in Russia on allegations of spying since the Cold War, rattling White House officials and further straining ties between Moscow and Washington. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed his arrest on Sunday, according to a statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry, as relations between both parties have soured since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia’s main security service, the FSB, claimed that Gershkovich, a correspondent based in Moscow, had been trying to obtain state secrets. The Wall Street Journal categorically rejected the accusation. Last week, the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained in Russia, giving further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are unfounded. US President Joe Biden has also been blunt about Gershkovich’s arrest, urging Russia to “let him go.” In December, the US negotiated the release of basketball star Brittney Griner, detained last year on what the US described as false drug smuggling charges, in a prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. But the swap did not include another American whom the State Department has declared to be unlawfully detained, Paul Whelan. The same FSB investigator who led the Whelan investigation, Alexei Khizhnyak, is now investigating Gershkovich. As US officials begin to consider ways to secure Gershkovich’s release, some are concerned about a prisoner swap in this case incentivizing the detainment of American journalists. The United States “will look at creative and sometimes quite challenging options” to bring Gershkovich home, but the process could take a long time, a senior administration official told CNN Tuesday. The official would not go into details about the options that the US is considering to secure the release of Gershkovich, and wouldn’t say if any proposals have yet been put on the table with Russians. “Until an American is home, we’re always exploring and re-exploring and re-exploring what the options might be available to bring that American home,” the official said. The official noted that in the past the Russians have wanted legal proceedings – which the US views as “illegitimate” – to play out in court first before they will engage in any serious negotiations. “And that may well take a long time,” the official said. And though the US Ambassador to Moscow was finally able to visit Gershkovich for the first time on Monday, the senior administration official said the US can’t be confident that the US will be granted consular access to Gershkovich again before his next hearing. Russians have “flouted the norms of access that we think are vital and fundamental, including playing some very silly games about even us trying to get paperwork to Evan and trying to deliver that, trying to use the Postal Service deliver that, I mean, just kind of silly and but at the same time, very inhumane stuff for somebody in these conditions,” the official said. “Given the way the Russians have treated this matter, but given the way they’ve also treated Whelan, Griner, Reed before that, I fear that we can’t count on norms being adhered to,” the official said, calling lack of regular consular access “appalling.” ",1047,europe,2023-04-18,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/europe/evan-gershkovich-appeals-detention-russia-intl/index.html

      Putin visits Russian troops at military headquarters in Kherson
    ","Russian President Vladimir Putin visited troops at a military base in the southern Kherson region on Tuesday, at a critical stage in the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to launch a spring offensive. In his second public trip to territory occupied since last year’s invasion, the Kremlin leader spoke to commanders from the Airborne Forces of Russia’s “Dnieper” army unit, while also meeting with other senior officers, Russian state media TASS reported. One of the purposes of the visit was to get a “report” from military officials on Kherson, which is partly held by Russia, and the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, according to TASS. In video released by the Kremlin, Putin’s convoy passed a sign that indicates he visited Henichesk, a town in southern Kherson that has become a headquarters for Russian forces. “I do not want to distract you from your direct duties related to command and control,” Putin said to senior commanders. “Therefore, we are working here in a business-like manner, briefly, but concretely. “It is important for me to hear your opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to you, to exchange information. I would ask you to start your report with the situation in the Kherson direction, then in the Zaporizhzhia direction.” Russian forces occupy parts of both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, with some analysts predicting that the front lines in southern Ukraine will be the focus of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the coming months. Further east, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited soldiers at a hospital in the beleaguered town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, where he awarded medals to injured troops. Zelensky listened to a report from the commander of the Donetsk operational-tactical group and talked to servicemen of the marines, airborne assault, mechanized and artillery units. “I have the honor to be here today, to thank you for your service, for defending our land, Ukraine, our families. Congratulations on the holidays, on Easter, I wish you only victory – this is what I wish for every Ukrainian, this is what is very important to all of us,” he told the soldiers, according to the president’s office. “I wish good health to all of you and your families, and I am sincerely grateful on behalf of every Ukrainian for the great path that you overcome every day.” Avdiivka has been the site of intense fighting for months and is largely destroyed, although some 1,800 civilians still remain despite efforts to persuade them to leave. There are no safe routes out of the town, but Ukrainian forces still control the routes to the west. The town is under fire almost daily by Russian artillery, but Ukrainian defenses have largely endured, despite marginal advances from Moscow to the north. Troops from both sides are grappling with physical exhaustion and depleted ammunition stocks, in a grinding war of attrition that the US and Western allies do not expect will end this year. Russian forces have reinforced defenses in the south, including extensive mining of territory along the front lines, according to Ukrainian and western officials. US intelligence documents leaked online in recent weeks also suggests broad infighting between Russian officials. The documents, reported by the New York Times – which CNN has not seen – suggest disagreements between Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry over Russia’s casualty count for the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin said it doubts the “reliability” of the reports. On Tuesday, Putin said he will ask Mikhail Yuryevich Teplinsky, the head of Russia’s Airborne Forces, called the VDV, “to express his thoughts” because “he was on the front line for quite a long time.” Until recently Teplinsky was thought to have fallen out of favor with the Russian defense ministry and likely dismissed from his role, in a sign of discord amid Moscow’s stuttering campaign in Ukraine. However, UK intelligence suggested last week that his position was reinstated. “Teplinsky is likely one of the few senior Russian generals widely respected by the rank-and-file … his recent turbulent career suggests intense tensions between factions within the Russian general staff about Russia’s military approach in Ukraine,” the UK MoD said. The MoD added that “he was previously dismissed from the theatre in January.” Teplinsky was one of the commanders involved in the withdrawal of Russian forces from parts of Kherson west of the Dnipro River in November 2022. Moscow’s retreat from Kherson marked a humiliating setback for Putin, but the manner of the withdrawal was well conducted with minimal losses. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based analytical group, said “Teplinsky remains highly unlikely to restore the VDV to its prior status as an elite force due to widespread losses to the most elite Russian units that are now being restaffed with poorly trained mobilized personnel.” It said his reappearance “additionally suggests that the Russian military command is likely seeking to place an increased emphasis on the role of VDV elements in Russian offensive operations.” The UK MoD noted that Teplinsky’s return to command in Ukraine will not be limited to VDV units, but likely meant that Teplinsky will try to promote the VDV’s traditional role as an elite force.

      Some Ukrainians who fled Russia’s war ended up in Siberia. It’s unclear if or when they’ll return home
    ","A year ago, Natalia’s life was upended by war. With her family, she fled the fighting in Ukraine’s southeastern city of Mariupol and crossed into Russia. From there, she and many other Ukrainians were encouraged by Russian authorities to take a 4,000-mile train journey east to the very edge of Siberia, to a coastal town called Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan, a stone’s throw from North Korea. It’s closer to Alaska than to the front lines. In the absence of a reliable evacuation corridor to Ukrainian-held territory, going to Russia was the only option for many people in Mariupol at that time. Ukraine describes these refugees as forcibly deported, though Natalia says no one forced her to leave. “It was our decision,” she told CNN by phone from Russia’s far east, where she has resettled since arriving last spring. Now, as Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds into a second year, she and others lead an uncertain existence, unsure if, or when, they will ever be able to return home or be welcome when they get there. Over the course of many months, CNN has managed to reach a handful of Ukrainians through a group chat run by Russian volunteers for current and former residents of a hotel used as a temporary shelter, where they stayed while searching for longer-term work and housing. CNN is not using their full names in this story for privacy and security reasons. Many of the new arrivals in Nakhodka, in Russia’s Primorskiy Krai region, were reluctant to say much about their circumstances or share their opinions, but others shared enough to get a clearer snapshot of life in Russia’s far east and how Ukrainians there are adjusting. Some offered mildly pro-Russian views, others declined to answer questions about the war, while some even gave scathing criticism of Ukraine. No one directly criticized Moscow but, of course, it’s not clear how freely people felt they could speak. The United Nations estimates more than 2.8 million Ukrainians have taken refuge in Russia over the past year. Some – largely those who could afford it – have transited through Russia to other countries in Europe, and many have even made it back to Ukraine. International law prohibits forcible transfers of people and stipulates that evacuees should be moved home as soon as hostilities have ceased. CNN requested comment from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on Ukraine’s allegation that its citizens have been forcibly deported to Russia, and on the situation for Ukrainians now living in Russia’s far east, but has not received a response. Their mere presence in Russia is ultimately a win for the Kremlin, according to Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, who has done extensive research on the mass migration of Ukrainians to Russia since the full-scale war began. Russia, he says, needs more people. “In many parts of the country, they don’t have enough citizens to make those municipalities function,” he said. There is also “a propaganda benefit, positioning these people as somehow, willingly seeking citizenship in Russia, which fits this broader narrative that Putin and the Kremlin [are pushing]… trying to rebrand the war as saving Ukrainians from purported Nazis.” Russia has tried several experiments to attract people to its resource-rich far east, including from ex-Soviet states. Now, state programs are being repurposed to accommodate fleeing Ukrainians. Those who agree to go to Russia’s far east are promised a cash payment, housing assistance, Russian citizenship and potentially even free land. The cost of living in Primorskiy Krai, whose main city is Vladivostok, is the 11th-highest in Russia, more expensive even than Moscow and St. Petersburg regions, according to official figures. This is due in part to the rate of new home-building lagging behind the national average. Natalia, who was an office worker in Mariupol, has now found work in a local food-processing plant. She told CNN she’s struggling with the cost of rent. She hopes to find a job that better matches her skills, but for now it’s all she can find. She misses home, but at least the maritime climate reminds her of coastal Mariupol. Her husband and daughter are with her, and she says she has no family remaining in Ukraine. “Nothing’s changed (in the past year) except the place,” she said. “But I no longer have a job that I love and a home I love.” Russian authorities took her Ukrainian passport and swapped it with a Russian one, Natalia says. The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that “no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality” and that everyone has a right to leave any country, even their own. When Natalia spoke to CNN, she seemed resigned to making the relocation work for her family long term. Under the terms of her resettlement, she must live there for at least three years, or be forced to repay any state benefits her family has received. Ukrainian people who have signed on for the years-long program are in “basically a degree of indentured servitude,” Raymond said. “Being in a contract, so to speak, for three years puts them in a very vulnerable position.” It’s critical to recall that their core rights under international law mean “they have a right to return, and they have a right to return safely,” regardless of any agreement, he said. Natalia is allowed to travel freely but says she won’t go back to Ukraine. “Those who left for Russia are immediately considered criminals by the Ukrainian authorities, so I am forbidden to go there,” she told CNN by phone. “I don’t want to take the risk,” she added, even if she still had a Ukrainian passport. Others who spoke to CNN also expressed reluctance to return. “We will stay in Russia. I don’t even want to think about Ukraine,” Valeriya, another Ukrainian who ended up in Nakhodka, told CNN by text. “At this point, the absence of clarity is the biggest problem” when it comes to Ukrainians in Russia, and whether they are free to return home, Raymond said. “There is, understandably, within Ukraine an absolute outrage against those who are perceived as collaborators. But the fact of the matter is that we are dealing here with a civilian population … that was seeking refuge in a time of war,” he said. Raymond says there have been local examples in Ukraine of reprisals against perceived collaborators – even against those who merely fled east because it was their only way out of the war zone. Kyiv, he says, must make it crystal clear that Ukrainians citizens who ended up in Russia can come home, otherwise, many likely won’t. And that only serves Russia’s interests. The Ukrainian Ministry of Reintegration referred CNN’s questions to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office. In a statement, it told CNN that it recognizes that for many people “the only safe passage was through Russia. Of course, they are not considered collaborators […] They need to get to any third country and address a local Ukrainian consulate. It will issue them Ukrainian documents to return to Ukraine.” It’s less clear whether those Ukrainians who remain in Russia long term will be welcomed back without issue. By law, Ukraine considers those who publicly deny occupation, assist the Russian military in Ukraine, or even call for support of Russian actions, to be collaborators and liable for criminal penalties. Oksana, another of the Ukrainians in Nakhodka who says she now has both Ukrainian and Russian passports, says she would like to return to Mariupol to visit, but only if it’s part of Russia. “Somehow things are better in Russia – quieter, whereas it is a total mess in Ukraine. It is just unclear what it is that our government is doing,” she told CNN by phone, adding: “I am for peace all over the world.” Fellow Ukrainian Marina wrote in a text message that after three years, “We will see. It depends on the job and material well-being. So far, it’s not very easy.” Raymond suspects that many of those who ended up in Russia’s far east are less affluent, and therefore less likely to take the long, expensive trip back to Ukraine should they want to go. War after war, the same pattern can be seen – those with the least money have the fewest options, he says. “It is those who don’t have the means to flee through Europe, through the Baltics, that often get stuck in situations where they can be exploited.” The United States’ National Security Council declined to say whether Ukraine should do more to assure citizens who fled to Russia that they can re-enter with no issue. But it said the US is providing assistance to identify and locate Ukrainian refugees who have been detained and interrogated in Russia and is imposing sanctions and visa restrictions on Russian officials and companies in order to hold Russia accountable for what the US describes as forcible deportations. Oksana says Russia was never part of her plan, even as she took shelter in a squalid basement shelter in Mariupol while the city was besieged by Russian forces. “I was going to stay and die there, were it not for my daughter who said, ‘Mom, I don’t want to eat like this and die in the basement.’” With Oksana’s brother already in Russia’s far east, they decided to go. Oksana says the volunteers have been helpful and that although some locals have suggested she “go back,” others have encouraged her to stay – which, for now, is what she intends to do.

      Poland and Hungary ban Ukrainian grain amid glut from neighbor
    ","Poland and Hungary have banned imports of grain and other food products from Ukraine following a surge in cheap goods. The Polish prime minister’s office said the move was “to protect the Polish agricultural market against destabilization.” Ukraine responded by saying it “regrets the decision of its Polish counterparts” and was ready to cooperate with Poland in an investigation of any possible abuses. Hungarian Agriculture Minister István Nagy on Sunday announced Budapest would also temporarily ban the import of grain, oil seeds and other agricultural products from Ukraine, saying the move was necessary “in the absence of meaningful EU measures.” The European Commission condemned the move, saying it was not for individual members to decide trade policy. “It is important to underline that trade policy is of EU exclusive competence and, therefore, unilateral actions are not acceptable,” the commission’s Arianna Podestà told CNN. When Russia invaded Ukraine it blocked ports and sea routes used to export Ukrainian grain to Africa and the Middle East. Fearing widespread famine, the European Union lifted duties on grain from Ukraine to ease distribution to those global markets. Ukrainian grain has since flowed into Poland but much of it has remained in the country, bringing down the price and causing Polish farmers to suffer significant financial losses. Farmers across central and eastern Europe have been demonstrating against Ukrainian grain imports. Protesters blocked traffic and border checkpoints with tractors along the border between Romania and Bulgaria, in an effort to prevent Ukrainian trucks from entering their country. Local producers say they cannot compete with the price of Ukrainian grain and have demanded compensation from the European Commission. Anger grew after the European Commission announced a draft decision to extend duty-free and quota-free imports of Ukrainian grain until June 2024, prompting the resignation of the Polish agriculture minister. There has been similar opposition in Bulgaria, where producers have complained of warehouses full of products they cannot sell. “Bulgaria is in solidarity with Ukraine, but a local glut is being created on the agricultural market, because instead of export corridors our countries are becoming warehouses,” Bulgaria’s agriculture minister Yavor Gechev said.

      Europe’s migration policies in chaos as arrivals surge
    ","As a boat carrying 400 migrants drifted, out of fuel, along a perilous migration route in the central Mediterranean last week, Italian authorities led a major rescue operation following the reported refusal of Maltese authorities to retrieve those on board. Passengers’ desperate pleas for aid went unheeded for nearly a week before they finally reached Italian shores on Wednesday, along with 800 migrants stranded for more than 10 days on another vessel. Many of the migrants fell to the ground once they climbed ashore, severely dehydrated and covered in vomit from the rough seas, witnesses said. Few were wearing life jackets. NGOs operating in the area, including German organization Sea-Watch International, said they had repeatedly alerted Maltese authorities to the boat, only to be ignored. “Malta rather takes the enormous risk of 400 people dying than care for these people themselves,” Sea-Watch said. The Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) told local media that no rescue was requested by people on board the ship, according to the Malta Independent. They did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. But the episode was yet another tussle between EU countries that sheds a fresh spotlight on the bloc’s inability to negotiate who should accommodate a spike in migrant arrivals, something that critics say is only leading to further suffering and tragedy. By the time the occupants of the first two boats finally reached safety, two more, both containing around 450 people, had been spotted at sea. Again, Sea-Watch International alerted both Italian and Maltese authorities, it confirmed to CNN, but no rescue was launched immediately by either country. The number of undocumented people arriving on European shores by sea has skyrocketed so far this year due to conflict, global inequality and the climate crisis. More than 36,000 migrants arrived in the Mediterranean region of Europe from January to March this year, nearly twice the number compared with the same period in 2022, according to the latest figures from the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR). It is the highest number since the refugee crisis that peaked in 2015 and continued into the first months of 2016, when the arrival of more than one million migrants on Europe’s shores led EU solidarity to collapse into bickering and border chaos. So far this year, more than 98% have arrived by sea, against 2% by land, the highest share since 2016, according to the UN. And an estimated 522 migrants have died or gone missing en route, the UN data shows, capturing the lack of safe and legal routes available to refugees and asylum seekers. “People flee because they have to get away from these very difficult situations at home,” said Jenny Phillimore, a professor of migration and superdiversity at the University of Birmingham in central England. “Why are they taking these risks and getting into the boats? Because there are no safe and legal routes – they have no choice.” Every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution and poverty risk treacherous routes to Europe in search of safety and better economic prospects. But the lack of safe and legal migration corridors available to refugees and asylum seekers can lead to deadly consequences. In March, at least 28 migrants died after their boats sank off the coast of Tunisia as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to Italy. The month prior, at least 93 people were killed after a wooden boat carrying migrants from Turkey crashed on the rocks off the coast of Calabria in southern Italy. Further north, four people died in December after a small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized in the English Channel, in one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. In many cases, migrant vessels are overcrowded and unfit for the journey, and the need to expend resources to rescue those on board can lead to European countries shifting responsibility because authorities “don’t want people landing on their shores,” added Phillimore. “Italy has long been one of the countries that (has) seen a larger proportion of arrivals across the Mediterranean, in comparison to northern European countries. Whilst the EU Commission has tried to instigate sharing and quotas, it really hasn’t worked out,” she said. Italy’s cabinet on Tuesday issued a state of emergency following the migrant boat arrivals. Those on the vessels are considered migrants, even if they come from countries that qualify for asylum status. They are not recognized as refugees until the lengthy process is completed. Italy’s populist, right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is set to introduce new legislation this month that will tighten rules to include forced repatriation for migrants who do not meet refugee status requirements. Currently, migrants who do not meet those standards are given a notice to leave the country, but unless they are stopped by law enforcement, expulsion is rarely enforced. The amendments are likely to pass given strong support from opposition lawmakers and the European Union, as well as Meloni’s large majority in parliament. Italy has asked its EU partners for help in the repatriation and processing of migrants as well as in hosting those who do qualify for refugee status under protocols stipulated by UNHCR. Elsewhere in Europe, humanitarian bodies have called out leaders for proposing policies aimed at restricting border access to alleviate pressure on rich countries, where systems for dealing with undocumented migrants are overwhelmed. Opposition lawmakers and human rights campaigners recently criticized the UK government for “cruel” and unworkable plans to house migrants in disused military bases and barges rather than hotels. It came as British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s cabinet faced accusations of violating international law with a  proposed illegal migration bill, which plans to send refugees and asylum seekers who arrive in the United Kingdom by boat either to Rwanda, or to their country of origin. In 2022, 74,751 asylum requests were made in the UK, according to the UK government. The total number of people waiting for an asylum decision more than doubled between 2020 and 2022, from around 70,000 to 166,300, according to the Home Office. Critics say the UK immigration system has been neglected and is failing. “The bill would prevent a large group of extremely vulnerable refugees from relying on human rights protections, by leaving it up to the Home Secretary to decide who should be protected and who should be deported – and excluding the courts almost entirely,” Adam Wagner, a leading human rights barrister, told CNN in March. In Italy, 77,195 applied for asylum last year, according to the Italian Interior Ministry. Of those, 52,625 applications were examined and 53% were denied asylum. Those who are denied can appeal the decision, but most slip away and go undocumented. Further west, in France, of the 137,046 asylum requests that were registered in 2022, 56,179 were granted, according to the French Interior Ministry. Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees said that 244,132 asylum applications were filed in 2022. Of those 72.3% were granted, with some of the approved applications including backlog requests from the previous year. In Greece, 37,300 applications for asylum were lodged, about a third more than 2021, according to the European Union Agency for Asylum. Of those, 30,886 were examined, and of those 19,243 were granted and 11,643 were denied. A month prior, UNHCR condemned reports that nearly 100 migrants were stripped of their clothes at the border between Greece and Turkey. In 2021, Greece finished building a 40-kilometer (25-mile) wall along its border with Turkey amid concerns that the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan could cause an influx of people seeking asylum. Greece was at the heart of Europe’s migrant crisis in the mid-2010s, when millions of refugees and migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq journeyed across  the continent. It has taken a hardline stance since then, rejecting pleas from Turkey and international organizations to allow more migrants through its borders. “The answer to this problem is not just the response of one country, certainly the countries who have fuelled the geopolitical inequalities and have generated the type of problems people are fleeing … also have a responsibility and the Global North are not pulling their weight,” said Phillimore. “(Countries in) the Global North have more money, but they are taking far fewer people.” European leaders’ failure to coordinate a cohesive response to increased migrant arrivals and relocate asylum-seekers across the continent has created a “political deadlock,” according to researchers. During the migrant crisis in 2015, a confluence of political conflicts including the rise of ISIS, the Syrian civil war, and instability in Afghanistan in the Middle East and elsewhere drove record numbers of people to leave their homes and try to make the crossing to Europe. That year, 1,000,573 people reached Europe via the Mediterranean by sea, with almost 4,000 feared drowned, according to UNHCR. The highest number of refugees entering the EU traveled via Libya. At the time, the EU had entered a new agreement in the Mediterranean based on “cooperation with the Libyan authorities,” said Luca Barana, a research fellow at Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI) and Coordinator of the T20 Italy Task Force on Migration. In the aftermath of the Libyan civil war Tunisia has become the new departure gate to Europe, but while there an agreement between Italy and Tunisia there is no similar, EU-wide agreement. The departures from Tunisia has also increased due to “growing adversity and discrimination against Sub-Saharan migrants residing in Tunisia,” Barana added. Rather than adopting a “cooperative” approach with Tunisia, “the European Union is investing in enhancing border control infrastructure and increasing the number of returns and readmission,” Barana noted. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it is “deeply alarming” that EU countries are trying to renege on commitments to rescue refugees and asylum seekers stranded at sea. “As more people are being forced by conflict and human rights violations to undertake dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean to seek safety in Europe, it is deeply alarming and disappointing that EU countries are trying to abdicate to their duties to rescue people in distress at sea under international law,” a spokesperson for the international NGO told  CNN. Liz Throssell, a UN human rights spokesperson, has also called for the ending of policies that enable human rights violations against migrants. “UN Human Rights has also repeatedly deplored the prevention or obstruction of humanitarian search and rescue efforts, including through impounding of vessels and criminalisation of providers of assistance and other defenders of the rights of migrants.” Several NGO workers have faced legal obstruction after attempting to rescue migrant boats stranded at sea. In January, human rights groups and the European Parliament roundly condemned a trial of 24 emergency workers in Greece, after they were arrested in 2018 to assist refugees that became stuck in a dinghy after leaving Turkey. Daniele Fiorentino, a professor of political sciences at Roma Tre University in Rome in Italy, said that the refugees whose lives are at stake should be prioritized when it comes to the EU’s policies regarding migrant boat arrivals in the region. “Maybe today the situation is less critical than in 2015, but that the tragedy … is the result of a weakness or ineffectiveness in the decision making process both in Italy and in Europe,” he told CNN. “Whose responsibility is it to rescue people lost at sea, who is monitoring the process and making the decisions? In doing this, authorities, and we all, should always keep in mind that the main issue at stake here is very immediate and clear: saving human lives.” ",1914,europe,2023-04-16,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/europe/europe-migration-chaos-boat-arrivals-intl/index.html

      How the Biden administration can ensure mask access to all Americans
    ","Health care workers vividly remember the anxiety surrounding mask access in the early days of the pandemic. The shortages of personal protective equipment in hospitals were so severe that it was an all-too-common occurrence to walk into work, only to find that there were no available N95 respirators in your size. Hospitals did their best to come up with solutions to circumvent this shortage – including recommending repetitive use, performing ultraviolet light cleanings of used masks and simply rationing – but we still remember the stress of feeling physically under-protected. Thankfully, as we enter year three of the pandemic, access to masks in the health care setting has improved. However, the Omicron variant has led to some of the highest daily case counts since the start of the pandemic and many states are utilizing greater than 70% of their inpatient and intensive care unit beds. The rapidly infectious nature of Omicron has made many public health leaders reconsider the approach to masking for the general public. On Friday, the CDC updated its mask guidance for preventing the spread of Covid-19. The agency provided additional information about the various types of masks that are available and in which circumstances each type is appropriate. Overall, it is recommended that individuals wear masks that “fit well” and that they will “wear consistently,” with the understanding that higher quality masks like N95s and KN95s will offer more protection than a simple cloth mask if worn correctly. While higher quality masks provide better protection, multiple barriers prevent widespread public use of them. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that, when masks are required in the workplace, those masks must be approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This has led to false marketing of non-NIOSH-approved masks and prompted the CDC to publish a guide on identifying counterfeits. On Project N95, a nonprofit organization which lists vetted masks and respirators, the prices for 20 N95s range from $27-$124. In addition to quality misrepresentation and financial limitations, proper size and fitting of these masks can vary from person to person. President Joe Biden announced Thursday that his administration would make high-quality masks widely available and free for Americans. Also last week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to provide three N95 masks to every American using the United States Postal Service for distribution and additional pick-up sites at community locations. While these are promising steps for increasing mask access, we strongly urge officials to value local partnerships in their initiatives. If vaccine rollout and the testing shortages have taught us anything, it is that we need to be proactive in ensuring equitable access to these masks. While the administration has noted that the masks will be available at some local pharmacies and community centers, it will be critical to ensure that sufficient supply is available to those who have high risk exposure to the virus. For example, those who work outside of the home and interact with others may need more masks than those who work from home. In addition, if the method of signing up for free masks is similar to the current federal government’s free at-home Covid-19 test website that went up Tuesday, individuals with broadband access issues and limited English proficiency may be unable to navigate these services. We, therefore, recommend the following three venues for mask distribution that will address both equitable access and effective use. The first location is in established areas where people are already receiving medical care. These include the community centers and pharmacies that the administration has noted will be distribution spots, but the list should extend to primary care clinics, hospitals, medical and dental centers, Covid-19 vaccination sites and Covid-19 testing centers. By partnering with local places that the general public regularly uses and trusts with their health, effective education and prevention can be achieved. A state-based program in Maryland is already pursuing this method and will soon be distributing high-quality masks at state-run testing and vaccination sites. The second location is the workplace. Individual companies could put in requests for masks based on their number of employees. Given that a “high-quality” mask is one that is not wet or soiled, organizations would have to assess the likelihood of mask reusability depending upon the task the employee is hired to do and request masks for more frequent changing if needed. Especially after the recent Supreme Court ruling blocking the general workplace vaccine mandate, masks can be a line of protection for vulnerable populations while at work. In Los Angeles, employers are already required to provide well-fitting medical-grade masks to employees who work indoors in close contact with others. The third location that would benefit from high-quality mask distribution is schools. We have argued in the past that school mask mandates play an important role in fighting the spread of this virus. For younger children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine or whose household members are immunocompromised or unvaccinated, high-quality masks may be their primary source of protection during the school day. There are no N95 respirators designed for children and only certain KN95s and medical-grade surgical masks are made to fit children. Given the difficulties in purchasing these masks (including costs and supply availability), school partnerships would provide more equitable access. The number of masks needed could be identified through school rosters and then allocated appropriately. States like Colorado have been distributing free at-home Covid-19 testing kits through school-based programs. Similar processes to this can be used to plan for mask distribution. Compared to the early days of limited personal protective equipment, we have made great strides. When the administration releases their plans for mask distribution this week, we hope they take into account the lessons learned thus far from the pandemic. By distributing high-quality masks directly to the public where they are at, we can maximize protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus – balancing equitable access and effective use for all.

      What 2020’s pro-Trump phony electors means for 2024
    ","As the January 6 House select committee continues to investigate the events surrounding the insurrection, there has been great interest in what is a typically overlooked, yet important component of the election process – the presidential electors who vote in the Electoral College. I have spent 20 years studying these little known figures, warning about the potential hijinks they could cause. Yet even I have been surprised by what has been uncovered in the wake of the 2020 election. It has become clear that then-President Donald Trump wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to use extraconstitutional powers to manipulate the tabulation of electoral votes to secure a second term despite his defeat in the election. One component of this scheme was to send phony electors to cast ballots in closely contested states that were carried by President Joe Biden. At the time, Trump adviser Stephen Miller stated: “An alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we’re going to send those results up to Congress.” Upon hearing Miller’s remarks, I wrote that those votes amounted to “pretend votes” and would not be counted in Congress due to the existence of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA). The act came into existence nearly a decade after the disputed election of 1876 – and was meant to provide a means to avoid constitutional crises where multiple elector slates from the same state are sent to be counted before Congress. Among other things, the ECA requires that if Congress receives two electoral slates, it should count the slate carrying the state’s executive’s signature as the rightful slate. Since all the states in question in 2020 were certified as Biden electoral votes by their respective state executives, I considered those “alternative” votes to be purely performative, not intended to be substantive. I was wrong. It had not occurred to me that the Trump team could try to jettison the ECA and rely on Pence to unilaterally accept or reject which slates of electors were legitimate. After all, that would be akin to a self-coup. Apart from the traditional vision of a coup requiring a military takeover of the government, self-coups occur when governments depart from typical norms of democracy by altering election laws, calling into question election results or seeking to suspend their constitutions in order to stay in power. I have long been curious as to who actually participated in this plot, so I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request from National Archives. I received copies of slates of these phony electors from seven states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Given the extraconstitutional nature of the scheme, I expected that most would be Trump partisans on the political fringe. Instead, most were elected party officials, political officeholders and other key figures in state Republican politics. The return addresses on the certificates included the Arizona Republican Party, the Georgia Republican Party, the Republican Party of New Mexico, the Nevada Republican Party. Michigan’s came from Kathy Berden, who included the title, “Chair of the Michigan Republican Electoral College.” Pennsylvania’s was sent in by Bill Bachenberg, who referred to himself as the “Chairperson, Electoral College of Pennsylvania.” Wisconsin’s simply stated, “Chairperson of the Electoral College of Wisconsin.” When asked by The Detroit News about why she chose to participate in this scheme, Berden said, “I can’t comment on anything like that. That was a long time ago.” CNN reached out to Bachenberg for comment, but has not received a response. It is notable that at least a few high-profile would-be electors chose not to participate in the scheme – former US Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia and former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land being the most prominent among them. In total, of 84 people across seven states, 15 chose not to participate in this effort. Still, that a majority were apparently willing to participate in such a dubious plot suggests that undemocratic efforts have been sanctioned by party regulars and will likely persist if gone unchecked. Of course, these alternate slates weren’t without some glaring problems. The ECA stipulates that electoral votes should be certified by each state – accompanied with a signature by each state’s executive and delivered under each state’s seal. None of these alternate slates of electoral votes had a signature by a governor or a secretary of state, nor did they contain an official state seal. The alternate Michigan electors in this scheme were turned away from entering the statehouse, which is where electors are required to assemble to cast their ballots by Michigan state law. In addition to falsely claiming they were the “duly elected” Michigan electors, the certificate that they submitted to Pence and the National Archives indicated that they signed it inside the statehouse (which they didn’t). Much of the conversation around “alternate electors” now centers on the work of one of Trump’s lawyers, John Eastman, and his legal memo for how to overturn the results of the 2020 election. A key part of the memo had Pence introducing alternative slates of Republican electors in seven states that Trump did not win. In spite of the ECA, Eastman argued that Pence could unilaterally determine which of the two electoral slates should be counted – or potentially discard the votes from those seven states, claim that no candidate reached a majority of electoral votes and leave the selection of the president to the House of Representatives. Contrary to what he wrote in his memo, Eastman told the National Review last October that, “anybody who thinks that that’s a viable strategy is crazy.” Ultimately, Pence did not carry out the plan offered by Eastman and championed by Trump. In handling the dueling slate of electors, he thankfully deferred to the ECA to guide his actions. Indeed, in spite of the noise created by the Big Lie about the 2020 presidential election results, every state certified its election results, courts dismissed more than 50 election-related lawsuits and federal officials found no evidence of widespread fraud, concluding that the election was the “most secure election in American history.” However, given how far rogue electors in seven states went to undermine the election, it is clear further investigation and reforms are needed. First, the American people must learn who exactly was responsible for coordinating the effort to undo the 2020 elections. Identifying who organized the effort is a critical step toward accountability – both politically and legally. This underscores the important work of the January 6 committee. Second, the country does not have the luxury of waiting a decade to reform the ECA. Changes can include raising the standard to object to electoral votes, which is now set at only one senator and one House member, to a majority in both houses. Clarifying and limiting the vice president’s role in the joint session is another solution that should be considered. Notably, a House committee is currently considering reform. What’s clear is that lawmakers must act now to prevent a similar occurrence in the 2024 election. There appears to be bipartisan momentum to do so, and the legitimacy of our presidential electoral system depends on it.

      The fiercest fight of the 21st century – to save democracy
    ","Marina Nemat was only 13 years old when the freedom that she had taken for granted – singing in public, wearing a swimsuit at the beach and holding her boyfriend’s hand – was suddenly taken away. But what shocked Nemat the most was the speed of her nation’s descent into a theocratic regime in 1979. Within a matter of months, she and her fellow Iranians lost the limited rights they had enjoyed under the country’s previous government, itself a repressive monarchy. When Nemat dared to protest against the new regime, she was arrested and sent to the notorious Evin prison, where she would spend the next two-plus years, released just shy of 19 – alive, but deeply broken. From that traumatizing time, she says she learned “those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up.” Wai Hnin Pwint Thon was already four years old when she first met her father, Ko Mya Aye, a democratic activist who had been sent to prison for leading a peaceful protest against the military dictatorship in Burma (now known as Myanmar) in 1988. Though at first she thought he was being treated well, the iron bars that prevented her from embracing her father soon jolted Wai Hnin to reality. In that moment, she says, a child became an aspiring voice for human rights, one who would speak out over the nearly three decades since that meeting – as her father was repeatedly imprisoned, most recently after the military’s February coup. Wai Hnin, now living in exile, writes that her father’s “commitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work.” Evan Mawarire never got to experience freedom in his country. By the time he turned three, Robert Mugabe had become Zimbabwe’s prime minister – and for the next 37 years, the dictator would run the country with the full weight of the government and military behind him, claiming that “only God” could remove him from power. In 2016, Mawarire, now a pastor, concluded that the status quo in Zimbabwe could not stand. Corruption was rampant, deflation had replaced hyperinflation, and free and fair elections were long gone. His decision to post a video, in which he draped himself in the country’s flag while giving an impassioned lament for the current state of Zimbabwe, was a huge risk. Still, Mawarire tells CNN, he got to the point where he realized “no one else is going to fight for this country with as much passion and commitment as I am.” He was later imprisoned for his political activism and, like Nemat and Wai Hnin, now lives in exile. Mawarire, Nemat and Wai Hnin are among the 21st century’s freedom fighters – people who have risked their lives and liberty in a battle for democracy that is being fought globally. In this series, “Voices of Freedom,” 13 dissidents from around the world are telling their stories and making the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections. They are active participants in the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting democratic values at home and abroad. The stakes could not be higher. Freedom House, a nonprofit research organization, put this battle in almost apocalyptic terms in its annual report on liberty. “As a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world in 2020, democracy’s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,” wrote Freedom House’s Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz. “Incumbent leaders increasingly used force to crush opponents and settle scores, sometimes in the name of public health, while beleaguered activists—lacking effective international support—faced heavy jail sentences, torture, or murder in many settings.” The organization labeled 2020 “the 15th consecutive year of decline in global freedom” and determined that less than 20% of the world’s population now lives in truly free countries. Among the countries where democracy is under assault is the world’s longest lived modern democratic government: the United States. On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of insurrectionists stormed the citadel of US democracy – the Capitol – in an effort steal the 2020 presidential election from Joe Biden. For the first time in modern American history, a small but violent group of US citizens refused to accept the peaceful transfer of political power – and they showed how willing they were to go to extreme ends to try and keep then-President Donald Trump in office. Five people died that day, including one Capitol Police officer. And, according to a Department of Justice filing, the rioters caused an estimated $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol building. Though their efforts ultimately failed, the threat of another insurrection looms large over future US elections. A March poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core found that 15% of Americans believe that “patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.” Equally alarming is that, according to a late summer CNN poll, 51% of Americans believe it’s “at least somewhat likely that an election in the next few years will be overturned by elected officials because their party lost.” When Americans do not have faith in the integrity of their elections, the impact worldwide can be devastating, says Gambian dissident Fatou Jaw Manneh. As she has struggled to build a young democracy in her home country, Manneh writes, “it wasn’t just American influence that made me demand better from the Gambian government – it was knowing that America was there that made me believe that I could succeed.” Imperfect and as unequal as it may be, she says, the United States “is still the most potent global force for freedom, and without it the world… faces a dark future.” Compounding problems, economic forces – including growing inequality – and the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put new stress on nations struggling with the challenge of autocracy. China and Russia are among the nations that are seeking to demonstrate that their systems of governance can reward citizens with improved prosperity – and without the freedoms taken for granted in the west. However, the Chinese government rejects the authoritarian label. In September, the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, gave a speech claiming China had a “whole-process democracy,” a system he said was built on the tenets of the Chinese constitution, which “prescribes that all power belongs to the people. The people have the right to election, and they can be broadly involved in national governance according to law.” These words follow a familiar pattern from Chinese officials who, for years, have made misleading claims about the true nature of Beijing’s political system, Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a China-focused research firm, explains to CNN. Though the Chinese government does hold elections, they are neither free nor fair nor representative of the will of the people, finds a 2021 Freedom House report, which also documented how Chinese President Xi Jinping used the pandemic to further expand his party’s surveillance of the Chinese people. There is a point to this game of political semantics, says Stone Fish. It forces a debate within the US and other western democracies about something that should be obvious – that China’s government does not meet any internationally accepted definition of democracy. It also helps to distract from allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, censorship of the press and crackdowns on civil society (all of which the Chinese government denies). But this debate does not negate a reality that many leaders of western democracies are acutely aware of – a growing dissatisfaction with their own form of government. At his first press conference in March of this year, US President Joe Biden remarked, “This is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies…We’ve got to prove democracy works.” There is one feature all democracies share in common – they give power to the people, whether directly or through some form of elected representation. For activist and RDI chairman Garry Kasparov, who has been on the frontlines of battling Russian repression for over three decades, that’s a system worth fighting for – even if it comes at great cost. He writes, “Hailing from the Soviet Union… a precursor to [President Vladimir] Putin’s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege – one that must constantly be defended.” Whether protesting the sentencing of Putin’s critics or taking to the streets of Moscow to demand free and fair elections, Kasparov, now living in exile, believes that democracy is an active sport that requires all of its citizens to participate. Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, tells CNN that an active citizenry is a hallmark of democracy. She argues that strong democracies have robust civil societies capable of engaging in the kinds of collective action Kasparov initiated in Russia but was arrested for partaking in. Simply put, citizens living in democracies should be able to express their dissent without risking retribution. And, Berman explains, they have multiple mechanisms to do so – whether by voting in elections in which two or more political parties are on the ballot, bringing lawsuits before an independent judiciary, writing or calling their elected leaders or taking to the streets in protest. Beyond the political characteristics that define a democracy, there are the social and economic factors that are critical to its success, says Berman. A real democracy must provide some form of social equality to all of its citizens, regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity. For Wai Hnin, social equality is one feature that has been sorely missing from Myanmar’s government, even as it instituted some democratic reforms prior to this year’s military coup. The most obvious example is the horrendous treatment of the country’s Muslim minority, the Rohingya. In late 2016, the Burmese military began carrying out the “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya, according to the United Nations human rights commissioner – driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya survivors into neighboring Bangladesh. (The Burmese military has largely denied these allegations.) Though Myanmar’s 2008 constitution forbids discrimination against any religious or ethnic minority, it also includes a section recognizing the “special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.” This ambiguity in the wording – combined with the power and influence of the Buddhist nationalists – has meant that minorities like the Rohingya have never been treated equally in civil society and have never had adequate representation in government under this constitution. But just as important as social equality is economic equality, which – when secured – gives citizens the opportunity to focus on other pressing issues. Unfortunately, according to Thomas Carothers, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, over the last four years, economic inequality and stagnation have been driving factors of protests across the world – from Argentina to Egypt, France to India. He and former Carnegie fellow David Wong write that this backlash is “a late-stage warning gong for capitalism,” arguing that public anger over various market failings, including the “dislocation and insecurity in the middle class” are behind the protests. And if democratic governments continue to let economic inequality grow, they will contribute to a growing sense that democracy cannot deliver for the people – leaving an opening for radical leaders to step in, Oliver Della Costa Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo, explains to CNN. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who might not have been competitive otherwise, was able to capitalize on the economic unrest in his successful bid for the presidency in 2018. As the country sunk deeper into a recession that began in 2014, and as a major corruption scandal plagued his predecessor’s administration, Bolsonaro positioned himself as a viable alternative. However, Stuenkel says, Bolsonaro did not necessarily win “because people thought he had better [economic] answers, but because part of the population didn’t have much to lose.” Bolsonaro’s campaign was built on one of the biggest criticisms of western democracy today – that even though citizens may still freely vote for their elected leaders, many of those leaders are self-serving elites who are out of touch with the economic and social needs of those they supposedly serve. That logic, Stuenkel explains, “makes putting a radical who…lacks any qualification to govern a more appealing option.” It goes far beyond Brazil. Across the world, far-right and far-left leaders have exploited people’s dissatisfaction with political elites and their maintenance of the status quo, Michael Abramowitz, President of Freedom House, tells CNN. Hungary offers a powerful example. In the 2010 election, Hungarians voted overwhelmingly for Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz Party, kicking out the socialist government which had run the country for eight years. With unemployment creeping into the double digits and the economy contracting over the previous year, the conditions were ripe for Orbán to offer a different vision – one in which Hungarians could prosper. And, according to several metrics, Orbán has addressed some of these dire economic realities. As of 2018, when he was elected for a third time, Hungary’s official unemployment figures and government debt had fallen, its credit rating had improved and its budget deficit had been approximately halved. Any economic gains have not come without a high political price, though. Since Orbán became prime minister, he and his party have chipped away at Hungarian democracy, pushing through a series of significant constitutional and legislative changes that have expanded his control of many of the country’s independent institutions – including its judiciary. More recently, his government “has moved to institute policies that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who criticize it or whose perspectives it otherwise finds unfavorable,” says a Freedom House analysis. Though once a highly-rated democracy, according to the latest Freedom House rankings Hungary is now classified as partly free – and stands to drop further in the rankings if it continues on its current course. Dissatisfaction with the status quo isn’t the only factor undermining democracies today. Abramowitz explains there have been dramatic changes in our “information environment.” In the early days of the internet and social media, activists were quite adept at using new information technologies to serve their democratic causes. But, in recent years, dictators and those who aspire to be them have learned how to use these technologies to serve their political agendas. One recent example is Russian attempts to impact democratic elections abroad with digital disinformation campaigns. Steven Wilson, an assistant professor of politics at Brandeis University, writes that these digital campaigns – often run across social media platforms – “exploit existing political fault lines like race and regionalism to increase polarization and disaffection with the political system.” The consequence is an erosion of citizens’ trust in institutions and each other. And without trust, he argues, democracy cannot thrive. One country where the impact of these kinds of campaigns has been felt is the United States. According to a declassified US intelligence report, Trump was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s pick for US president in 2016, and Russia used a two-part disinformation strategy to persuade the American public to vote against Hillary Clinton. As the report details, the Kremlin combined covert cyber intelligence operations targeting individuals and parties associated with the US presidential election, as well as overt efforts by Russian government agencies, third party intermediaries and paid digital trolls targeting American citizens. And while Trump’s 2016 electoral victory cannot be entirely credited to Putin, it appears Russian efforts succeeded in both undermining some Americans’ faith in US democracy and in giving Putin a disinformation playbook he could apply “to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,” according to the report. Indeed, the US intelligence community assessed that Putin, although unsuccessful in swaying the election in Trump’s favor, tampered in the 2020 US presidential election. But the same assessment revealed an even more disturbing trend – Russia was not the only regime waging information warfare in the US. Iran, Venezuela and Cuba each tried to sway American public opinion during the same election cycle. (All countries deny meddling in US elections.) According to Abramowitz, this is part of a dangerous pattern of copycat behavior among autocrats – learning worst practices from each other and using them to undermine trust in democracy. This web of digital disinformation has only exacerbated Americans’ loss of faith in government and institutions, which had already been on the decline even before the 2016 election, according to the Pew Research Center. And while trust in government tends to be higher among the party which controls the US presidency, even in April of this year Pew shows that only 36% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they trusted in the US government. That number dropped dramatically to 9% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. The clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump’s lie that he really won the 2020 election. Despite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden’s victory in the minds of the American people – at in-person rallies, through sham audits, in television appearances and in public statements. According to a CNN poll from August and early September 2021, they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans – and a startling 78% of Republicans – now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president. At the Oslo Freedom Forum in October, Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López argued that the world did not have to settle for a dark future. Those who believe in the fundamentals of freedom could win the war against dictatorship – but they need to be united and organized, and  they require assistance from leading democracies like the United States. This is no easy task. Hahrie Han, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, explains to CNN that democracy is only as strong as people’s commitment to it, and that commitment has waned in recent years. However, civic institutions – from schools to houses of worship to social clubs – can play a key role in strengthening democracies at home and abroad. Fundamentally, democracies demand that citizens accept they may not always get the electoral outcome that they want. Civic institutions, where people begin to encounter individuals and ideas they may disagree with, can teach the values of negotiation, compromise and even acceptance of a less than desirable outcome, she says. Linda Chavez, a conservative political commentator and RDI board member, believes the most important civic institution may be schools. In the US, she tells CNN, many students have received a “comic book version of history with superheroes and supervillains,” but without a deeper understanding of the struggle to expand American democracy to more and more citizens. It’s no surprise, Chavez says, that low voter turnout has become a defining feature of the 18 to 29-year-old demographic in the US (though 2020 did see an eight point rise in voter turnout among this cohort). If students spend time reading through the original documents that shaped American democracy – from the Federalist Papers to the US Constitution to the 1964 Civil Rights Act – Chavez reasons that students will not simply bemoan how unequal the US has historically been, but take pride in the multi-century struggle Americans have endured to expand civil rights and liberties. And perhaps they will feel more motivated to take part in that democratic struggle moving forward. While civic education is a critical piece of the democratic puzzle, there are additional efforts that must be taken to strengthen US commitment to democracy. And one of them must target the many Americans who have come to believe Trump’s election lies. Chavez says that conservatives must lead that effort. “The Constitution – which conservatives have always claimed to owe allegiance to – is under attack. Trump’s tenure was marked by his flouting of the rule of law and separation of powers, and now he is being aided by those who previously claimed to [be] champions of those very principles,” she writes to CNN. Chavez hopes that Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, though in the minority, can serve as models for speaking truth to Trump and his allies’ dangerous assertions of power. Beyond outreach to disbelieving Republicans, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, tells CNN that democratic activists must tap into the American population which does not vote or participate in the political process at all. In the 2020 US presidential election, which saw record voter turnout, about 80 million eligible voters still stayed home. According to 2020 US Census data, there are several reasons people cite for not voting, but chief among them is feeling disinterested in the political process. A 2020 Medill/NPR/Ipsos poll supports the census findings – almost a quarter of nonvoters said they were uninterested in politics and almost a third of nonvoters said they had not even registered to vote. According to a NPR analysis of this poll, these nonvoters “are disengaged, disaffected and don’t believe politics can make a difference in their lives.” Ben-Ghiat explains that voter registration and mobilization efforts must target these potential voters – and must do a more effective job at explaining how their votes can translate into concrete actions by elected representatives. Carothers says one way to plead this case is to show proof of concept. When Congress and the White House are able to work together to solve pressing issues facing the American public – such as economic inequality or aging infrastructure – they can argue that a system of governance, often plagued by gridlock, can also be a force for good in people’s day-to-day lives. And while this may seem an impossible task against the backdrop of America’s fractured politics, it is urgent that the nation’s elected leaders and citizens model the kind of behavior befitting a democracy. After the events of Jan. 6, RDI began hearing from activists and dissidents about the need for the US to quickly change course and set a worldwide example for true freedom. They wanted to “remind us of the importance of America’s founding values to our own success and to the global community as a whole,” Uriel Epshtein, Executive Director of RDI, tells CNN. In response, RDI launched the Frontlines of Freedom project. It features an open letter, signed by 52 dissidents from 28 countries, in which they argue, “If the world’s leading democracy doesn’t believe in its own values, why should dictators even bother paying lip service to them? We must defend these principles that inspire advocates of liberty and provide a crucial check on tyrants.” Beyond a firm commitment to secure voting rights and uphold democratic election results, those principles include protecting free speech and free press rights. As the signatories explain, we cannot defeat “illiberalism with illiberalism,” but rather with the creation of a space where ideas and opinions, however controversial or provocative, may be shared and debated. As democratic legislative bodies debate the parameters of these freedoms, they can still invest time and resources in strengthening civil society. And while a robust civil society is critical to the maintenance of democracies, it is perhaps even more critical in countries where activists are trying to lay the foundations of democracy. For example, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a whistleblower during the Trump administration, and Belarussian dissident Andrei Sannikov write that for Belarus to succeed in moving away from an autocracy that has governed its country for over 25 years, it “will require the collective action of other western nations committed to the values and principles of basic human rights and freedoms.” The United States could take lead on this by “providing material and ideological support to the country’s pro-democracy elements.” This kind of aid is far more practical, explains Roland Rich, an assistant teaching professor at Rutgers University and former Australian diplomat. Government-to-government aid, especially when one of the parties involved is not a democracy, is often highly ineffective in bringing about tangible change. However, he argues, “people-to-people aid” can empower citizens and civil society to organize and push for the freedoms they deserve. For Mawarire, who continues the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe, Rich’s thinking mirrors his mobilization efforts on the ground. He explains that one of his country’s democratic slogans has become, “If we cannot cause the politician to change, then we must inspire the citizen to be bold.” And while international support for democratic efforts can often play a critical role, Mawarire believes that much of the push for freedom must come from within countries where citizens are struggling against the weight of autocracy. The beauty of his advocacy work, he says, is helping fellow Zimbabweans recognize their agency in the political process and then driving them to say, “I’m not going to sit in the terraces or bleachers to watch other people [build democracy]. I’m doing it myself.” Democracy does not blossom overnight. Mawarire compares it to growing a garden and waiting patiently for the seeds of freedom to blossom. It may take time, but “there’s going to be a generation that’s going to harvest the fruits of democracy,” he says. Until then, all those who believe in the values of a free and open society must tend to the garden, watering, cultivating, and, when necessary, removing the weeds of autocracy that threaten to compromise its growth. Update: After the piece published, one RDI project signatory decided to remove her name.

      I met my dad for the first time when I was 4, and he was behind bars
    ","I was 4 years old when my mom took me to meet my dad for the first time. I thought we were traveling to a park or a playground, but then we arrived outside Insein prison in Rangoon (present day Yangon), Burma, and I was even more impressed. It was a massive compound with an imposing red entrance and more guards than I could count. “Is daddy very wealthy?,” I asked. My mom told me to keep quiet and stay close to her. Men in uniform drilled her with questions, while other guards rummaged through the gifts that we had brought for my dad. After waiting for hours in the scorching sun, we were finally allowed into a room where we met a man dressed in all white, and in handcuffs and shackles. I recognized him instantly – this was my father whose photo had hung on a glass cabinet in my house for as far back as I could remember. His wild hair from the photo wasn’t so wild anymore, but he still had that friendly smile on his face. I wanted to hug him, even though there were iron bars between us. I reached out my fingers so I could at least touch his hand. Although this first meeting happened almost three decades ago, I can so clearly remember it. That was the day I realized that my dad was a prisoner being kept by these guards. And those “gifts” that we brought for him? They were essential food and medicine, which he needed to stay alive behind these foreboding concrete walls. My father was first sent to prison for leading a peaceful protest against the Burmese military dictatorship in 1988. He was among thousands of students who marched on the street calling for democracy, human rights and freedom in my country. Since then, he has been in and out of prison for continuing to protest military rule and advocating for human rights. But his commitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work, and it could come with serious consequences – not just for my family or country but for the world at large. Following my first meeting with my father, I began to study the history of Burma. I learned that it had been under an oppressive military dictatorship since 1962. I also read how the military ruthlessly killed many peaceful protesters during the 1988 uprising and how they imprisoned thousands of civilians for simply believing in democracy and freedom. Though military regimes have come and gone since then, the military today – though it denies its brutality – continues to commit atrocities with impunity, according to the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights. The more I learned, the more certain I was that I needed to follow in my father’s footsteps. Though my father urged me to choose a different path, I refused to heed his warnings. I thought I might pursue teaching, since I believed education could play a crucial role in driving social change and empowering young people to fight for their rights. But because of my father’s political activities, I was denied entrance into any Burmese university. And so, in 2007, I arrived in the United Kingdom to study international relations. That same year, my father was arrested a second time for leading another peaceful protest. Even though I was thousands of miles away, I started campaigning for the release of all political prisoners in Burma – including my father. But what I had not fully anticipated was the consequence I would face from the Burmese government. Having used my voice abroad, I could no longer return home without facing the possibility of arrest. I subsequently became a political dissident in exile. In 2008, caving to a combination of internal and external pressures, the Burmese military regime drafted a new constitution, which while safeguarding much of their power, offered limited democratic and social reforms. Two years later, they released Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition leader who had spent nearly 15 years in detention, and allowed her to stand for elections in April 2012. For the United States and much of the international community, Suu Kyi’s freedom – and her party’s sweeping electoral victory in 2015 – marked a significant milestone in my country’s journey toward democracy. But it did not fully capture the subtle and not so subtle ways that the military continued to hold a tight grip on Burma. While the new constitution and Suu Kyi’s government provided a wider space for civil society – and greater access to tools like social media and the internet – the military still had guaranteed ministerial posts and appointed a quarter of MPs in the parliament. And while many of these social reforms were enacted in cities, the military was continuing to torture, rape and kill ethnic civilians in more rural areas, according to an independent report requested by the UN Human Rights Council. Despite warnings from human rights activists like me that the reform process in Burma was designed to keep the military in power, the international community largely ignored our concerns. Meanwhile, many activists in Burma who spoke out against the military and demanded genuine democracy were arrested and thrown in prison. In late 2016, when the military began perpetrating what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights referred to as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority, it seemed like things might be reaching a breaking point. Finally, we thought, the international community would wake up to the atrocities being committed in Burma and come to our aid. Except this aid largely took the form of sanctioning a few Burmese military generals, freezing their assets and banning them from traveling to the US. It’s no wonder Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the Burmese military, calculated that he could get away with staging a coup in February. The same day the coup began and Suu Kyi was arrested on trumped up charges, the military came for my father, who had most recently been released from prison in 2012. As a prominent democracy advocate, the military undoubtedly considered my father a troublemaker, and they arrested him before he could mobilize any anti-coup movement. But it wasn’t just him. Many others were taken from their homes across Burma to prisons they may never leave. I am heartbroken for my father, but I cannot stop thinking about the other children now condemned to go through what I went through – not knowing where their parents are or when they will see them again. I am encouraged to see that when the coup began, the US government took immediate action against the Burmese military by imposing targeted sanctions. But we need more. The US and the greater international community need to use all the tools at their disposal – diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and legal – to help people in Burma. Activists inside and outside the country have been calling for a global arms embargo to stop the flow of weapons to the military, additional sanctions on gas revenues that help fund the Burmese military, and support for efforts to report the military’s violent actions to the International Criminal Court. Though I do not know when my father will be released from prison this time, or when I will be able to go home safely, I will continue to speak out against the military and amplify the voices of people in Burma who have been oppressed by the brutal military regime. Yes, the Burmese military denies this oppression and says it’s part of its fight against terrorism, but the truth is that we are being persecuted. Despite the ongoing use of violence, I refuse to believe the Burmese military has won. People like my father and many others like him continue to risk our lives for the sake of freedom. And with the aid of the US and the rest of the free world, we might just have a chance to help the people of Burma achieve true democracy.

      Your rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to me
    ","I was 13 years old when the Islamic Revolution toppled the Iranian government in 1979. Though I was a Christian living in a largely Muslim country, I had never felt discrimination because of my faith. My grandmothers had escaped the 1917 Russian Revolution and fled to Iran in search of freedom. And to a certain extent, they had found it. My father had become a successful ballroom dancing instructor in Tehran and taught Muslim couples the cha-cha and the tango. My mother was a hairdresser who styled fashionable Muslim women’s hair. And I had grown up wearing bikinis on the shores of the Caspian Sea, while partying with my Muslim friends. The revolutionary leaders promised to expand social freedoms, grant political ones and build a democracy. They used our grievances against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, to win our trust and gain power. But as soon as they assumed office, the few personal liberties we had enjoyed vanished and a strict Islamic law was put in place. In less than a year, women’s rights to self-expression were stripped away: dancing, singing, holding our boyfriends’ hands in public and wearing bikinis all became largely forbidden activities. A few priests from my Roman Catholic Church, all of whom were foreign nationals who had lived in Iran for years, were deported, and several of the properties that belonged to the church were confiscated. The irony was that a few of my Christian relatives had trusted Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic revolutionary leader, and celebrated when the Shah was forced into exile. Now, they, like me, were paying the price. Though Iran’s transition from a nation of limited social rights to one of virtually none may seem like a distant reality to those living under democracy, the truth is that it is not. If Western democracies are not on guard, their citizens can fall prey to the same kinds of leaders who now control Iran’s political infrastructure. The revolutionary leaders were populists who promised to return power to the people after decades of monarchical rule, and for many disenfranchised voters in democracies who feel their elected officials have ignored their struggles, the populist messaging can have quite a strong appeal – even if it is just a ploy. But the risk is not only in losing civil or democratic rights, but in being punished for challenging the authority figures who have stripped citizens of those rights. After 1979, our accomplished teachers were replaced by fanatical young academics, many of whom were members of the newly formed Iranian Revolutionary Guard. They spent class time spreading the government’s propaganda and trying to persuade us that the regime’s fanatical rules – like forcing all women and girls over age 9 to wear the hijab – were for our own good. They argued that we had to dress modestly so that we would not attract unwanted attention from men. At the time, I told our principal that I was a Christian, so the new Islamic rules of modesty should not apply to me. She responded, “You believe in the wrong religion.” I was politically naïve, but I was also aggrieved, having experienced firsthand why freedom of religion mattered. I attended protest rallies to express my frustration with the new religious laws that limited or attacked the rights of Iranian women. Speaking out against the regime, in any shape or form, was now considered an act of war against God – the penalty for which could be death. And, in January 1982, the Revolutionary Guard arrested me for doing just that. At only 16, I had been accused of being an anti-revolutionary and sent to the notorious Evin prison. I was tortured, physically and emotionally, and then I was forced to marry one of my interrogators, who was assassinated 15 months after the marriage. Six months after his death – and two years, two months and 12 days after my initial arrest – I was released. My captors had decided that there was no reason to keep me any longer, perhaps because they had succeeded in destroying my spirit and suppressing my desire to protest. Many of my friends and cellmates had been executed while I was in prison, and I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder – not that I knew it at the time. I was just shy of 19 years of age when I was released. Though it took me several years – and a move to Canada – before I shared the details of my tragic story, I determined to do so because a democracy is only as good as its citizens. Now, living in the West, I have become acutely aware that even the strongest democracies are not immune to demagogues parading as populists. Those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up. Because once the demagogues – or aspiring ones –  have assumed control, it will be too late. Indeed, democracy is like water caught in the palm of our hands. If we do not focus on holding onto it, the water will drip away through our fingers, and we will be left with nothing but a burning thirst. Though Iran was not a democracy before the revolution, any hope of a peaceful transition to one post-revolution has all but faded today. The Islamic Republic of Iran masquerades as a democracy, holding elections for its parliament and president. Yet, its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who replaced Ayatollah Khomeini after his death, and his Guardian Council decide who is or is not fit to run in elections. And it certainly does not have a thriving free press or civil society. Anyone who criticizes the regime and its officials can be arrested and even condemned to death. The line that separates democracy from tyranny is not as thick as Westerners might choose to believe. In Iran, we believed that our good will, selfless efforts and desire for better governance could not possibly be manipulated and destroyed. Many of us even died during the revolution to bring the Islamic Republic into existence. But we were wrong, and we have been paying the price for close to half a century.

      What I learned about freedom from a 2x2 Venezuelan prison cell
    ","For many people, freedom is an abstract concept. It’s like breathing; you don’t think about it until you are gasping for air. The same thing happens with democracy. Too many voters take it for granted, until the moment they realize it’s entirely possible to have an election without democracy – just like in Cuba, Russia, Iran, and my home country of Venezuela. This became painfully clear to me while I was imprisoned for political opposition to President Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship. In a 2x2 meter cell with a lock the size of a brick, I learned what freedom was when I didn’t have it. The Venezuela I was born into in the 1970s was considered the envy of the Americas: a country with a strong economy capable of providing prosperity and opportunities to almost everybody. Venezuelan leaders had successfully built this regime of freedom after the downfall of Marcos Pérez Jiménez’s military dictatorship in 1958. Between the 1960s and 1990s, Venezuela was “the democratic exception” in Latin America, a title that every Venezuelan carried with pride. My country had some of the best public services of the region during that time – including a prestigious network of schools and universities and a health care system that helped eradicate malaria in parts of the country in 1961, as certified by the World Health Organization (WHO), a status Venezuela has since lost. This was an era when many Europeans and Latin Americans alike wanted to emigrate to Venezuela for a better life. Now, 22 years after Hugo Chávez’s presidency began and nearly a decade after Maduro seized power in what I believe was a fraudulent 2013 presidential election, Venezuela is undergoing the worst multilayered crisis in the continent. Poverty, violence, starvation, and shortages of crucial supplies are the new normal. A 2016 survey found that almost three-quarters of the population involuntarily lost an average of 19 pounds, with emergency rooms overwhelmed by cases of severely malnourished children. Hospitals lack the equipment and medicine they need to function, leaving families across the country at risk of dying without access to treatment – a situation aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Over 6 million Venezuelans have fled the country, many for fear of persecution or lack of economic opportunities. How did we turn from being an island of democracy to a broken dictatorship? I think the answer is twofold: First, we suffered an erosion of the essential elements of democracy. After becoming president in 1999, within a year, Chávez changed the national constitution and called for a “mega-election” that saw him inaugurated for a six-year term. He changed the political structure of the country; packed the Supreme Court; took control over the National Electoral Council; and labeled critical members of the free press as “enemies of the homeland.” Second, this democratic erosion was met with an immoral neutrality from democracies around the world. When we the Venezuelans were losing our freedoms, too many people in the region believed that our problem was not also their own. I witnessed this tragedy from my position as a local politician. After studying abroad in the US in the early 1990s, I returned to Venezuela and ran for public office in 2000. I was elected and reelected as mayor of Chacao, a powerful municipality in Caracas that is home to almost 80,000 people. For eight years, we proved that it was possible to serve democratically in a country being led in the opposite direction. That changed in 2008, when I was disqualified from running for governor of Caracas city, despite two consecutive successful terms as mayor of Chacao and over 70% popular support. Under Chávez, the National Comptroller banned my participation in any electoral process on charges of corruption and financial impropriety – a ban that went into effect before I was even formally charged with these false accusations. With no place to look for justice within my country, I took my case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and I won. In response, Chávez’s regime formally withdrew Venezuela from the inter-American system and, naturally, dismissed the ruling in my favor. Unable to serve, I visited towns and cities across the country, from the Colombian border to the Atlantic coast. I wanted to prove that it wasn’t necessary to be an elected authority to serve our people. What I saw on that journey were Venezuelans who were more than ready to fight for freedom and democracy. That experience led me, along with other democratic leaders, to establish the political party Voluntad Popular, a national movement steeped in grassroots activism. When Chávez’s successor, Maduro, rose to power in 2013, I asked our movement, “Are we living in a democracy, or a dictatorship?” We agreed on the latter. Inspired by nonviolent resistance from around the world, including the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring, and US civil rights movements, we chose to peacefully protest Maduro’s regime. The Venezuelan government’s response to our demonstrations was ruthless, and strikingly similar to what we have seen reported from the streets of countries around the world, from Belarus to Nicaragua: police brutality against peaceful protesters, arbitrary arrests and torture of opposition leaders, protesters sent into exile and some killed, as the UN has documented. In February 2014, Maduro ordered my arrest and that of other Voluntad Popular members. Despite international criticism that I was arbitrarily detained, I was prosecuted and sentenced to nearly 14 years after a trial controlled by the dictatorship – proceedings the UN criticized for lack of transparency and violation of due process. I spent more than three years in a military prison, where I endured physical and psychological torture. When my wife and other supporters shared what was happening to me, Maduro’s government denied the abuse. Many ask why Maduro is still in power, despite massive and ongoing protests. The truth is that he’s in power because he’s a dictator, and his regime’s response has been the same as others: repression and incarceration, the dictator’s recipe to hold on to power. Perhaps we need to understand that authoritarianism is a global phenomenon. Dictators, in fact, understand this very well. They form political allegiances to protect each other internationally and have developed a transnational repression policy in order to persecute those who oppose them. This is a global problem, and its solution should be global as well. To achieve democratic change in Venezuela, we must be part of a larger, globally organized effort. This idea is what convinced me to risk my life to escape from my country last year to resettle in Spain: A desire to be part of an international front that would help not only the people of Venezuela, but all those who live under authoritarian regimes.

      I was born in a Chinese ‘reeducation camp.’ I’m watching history repeat itself
    ","I was born in a Chinese reeducation camp, where my mother was detained in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which many Uyghurs call East Turkistan. For most of my life, I tried to forget the horrific experiences my mother and I had during my early childhood. But it seems the past is repeating itself – and with a vengeance. When I was born, the Uyghur region – like the rest of China – was in the throes of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. It was a period of totalitarian zeal: Almost anyone suspected of not being adequately communist was beaten, jailed or killed. Religious and ethnic minorities were particular targets. Mao’s zealots, called the Red Guards, came to the traditional Uyghur homeland to enforce the brutal policies of the tyrannical regime. The Red Guards burned religious texts, destroyed mosques, banned Uyghur-language books and ordered millions of Uyghurs – including my mother – into reeducation camps to be indoctrinated in Maoist doctrines and to be “reformed” through hard labor. While arbitrary reeducation on a large scale experienced a lull following the end of the Cultural Revolution, forced labor programs have remained a human rights concern in China in spite of the economic reforms of the following decades. Now, some half a century later, China is targeting the Uyghur population with a new fervor.  According to the US Department of Defense, China has detained possibly as many as 3 million Uyghurs in detention camps. Meanwhile, based on satellite imagery, CNN reports China has been destroying traditional Uyghur cemeteries. And, according to the accounts of several Uyghur women, it is incorporating an extensive forced sterilization program. Having experienced the reality of living under this regime, and now watching with horror as these atrocities are visited on my Uyghur brothers and sisters, it’s difficult for me to comprehend how any Western actor could push for greater dialogue or engagement with such a regime. How cheap are the lives of my people to the international community if it ignores reports of the Chinese government’s attempt to commit genocide against the Uyghurs? Democracies and nongovernmental organizations alike must do significantly more to support the Uyghur struggle – even if it comes with an inevitable backlash from the Chinese government. Since leaving China in 1995 to seek political freedom and pursue graduate education, I have made it my mission to speak out against the horrors perpetrated against the Uyghurs, despite the serious consequences I have had to pay. I have not seen my mother or father for more than 17 years. The Chinese authorities have prevented my ailing and aging parents from leaving to reunite with their American children and grandchildren. Though my parents have never been given a clear reason for this, I strongly believe it is because of my criticism of the Chinese government. As a lawyer, human rights advocate, and now vice chair for the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), I have advocated for human rights and religious freedom in China and around the world for many years. And, in these capacities, I have seen real progress in raising awareness of the atrocities perpetrated in the Uyghur region. But to have any meaningful impact, the world’s leading democracies must pursue a bolder strategy aimed squarely at hitting China where it hurts – weaponizing import bans and strategic investments. Appallingly, many of the products enjoyed by Western countries are made by interned Uyghurs in China. According to several reports, Uyghur forced labor contributes significantly to the world economy – particularly solar-panel manufacturing and cotton-growing industries. In a liberal international order, there can be no room for forced labor. The US Senate has taken serious steps forward on this issue by passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which establishes broad import bans on products from the Uyghur region. The US House of Representatives, which passed an earlier version of the bill in 2020, must now move quickly to pass this bill, so that President Joe Biden can sign it into law. Our European partners – another enormous market for Chinese products – must follow suit, and the United States should encourage our allies to join us in rooting out this evil practice. While the European Union is currently crafting due diligence protocol to address human rights violations within EU supply chains, it has not given a strong enough indication that it will adopt broad import bans for products produced by Uyghur forced labor. Europe endured the worst of the horrors of Nazism, fascism and communism – and should understand the consequences of failing to act in the face of a regime that seeks to eradicate minority groups. If the EU is to have any credibility as a moral leader, it must ban the import of products from Xinjiang. Indeed, such bans, which go further than many of the existing sanctions already in place, can go a long way toward mitigating the atrocious crimes that Beijing is committing in the Uyghur homeland. Consider some of the US sanctions, which are already proving to be effective at chipping away at two things the Chinese party leadership cares most about – economic interests and public image. Banning the import of agricultural products – such as cotton and tomatoes – has fractured the supply chains for the fashion and food industries. And the enforcement measures behind these sanctions have also created pressure points for US companies, forcing them to recognize the risks of doing business in China while also facing administrative, legal and reputational risks in the United States. In addition, public naming and shaming through the use of sanctions has sent a powerful message to Beijing that perpetrators of human rights abuses cannot remain anonymous. That’s not to say that this is a risk-free proposition for the countries implementing such a ban. Italy is one of the leading global importers of goods from Xinjiang, and it may be challenging for such a country to cut itself off from Xinjiang products, even if it would like to. That’s why it’s critical for powerful economies like the United States and other democracies to invest in viable alternatives to China’s forced-labor products, thereby making it easier for countries to diversify their supply chains. This June, the US Senate passed the US Innovation and Competition Act, which designates $250 billion to boost American scientific research, design and semiconductor manufacturing. The United States and its democratic partners should consider similar legislation to boost the manufacturing of products that have until now been dominated by companies operating with forced labor in Xinjiang. Both Donald Trump’s and Joe Biden’s administrations have labeled China’s actions toward the Uyghurs as a genocide, and the Canadian, British, Dutch and Lithuanian Parliaments have concurred. State signatories to the United Nations Genocide Convention are obliged to take action to halt genocide when it occurs and punish the perpetrators. Yet so much more remains to be done to address the continuing horrors of Xinjiang. This cuts to the legal and moral core of the liberal international order. The dual strategy of import bans and domestic investment may not be a panacea, but it is undoubtedly a meaningful step in the right direction. After watching a lifetime of abuse by the Chinese regime, such actions give me at least a glimmer of hope that Uyghur lives mean more to the international community than platitudes. Editor’s Note: The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any allegations of crimes – including forced labor and forced sterilization – against the Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples. It claims it is providing the Uyghurs with education at “vocational training centers” while assisting in deradicalization efforts to combat alleged terrorism.

      Asheville’s woes are the story of America
    ","If you want to understand how American politics has become more polarized and extreme over the last decade, look no farther than Asheville, North Carolina – now split between two of the most gerrymandered districts in the country. Gerrymandering – the dark art of drawing political maps to favor one party and disadvantage the other, which can be traced back to the earliest days of the nation – fundamentally altered the nature of political representation in the largest city in western North Carolina. Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores. And, a decade ago, North Carolina’s 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation’s most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds. It favored Republicans during the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled. This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative members of Congress, including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by double-digit averages. Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats. But when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance. Enter Mark Meadows, who won the 2012 GOP primary here with a vow to “send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is.” He’s held the seat since. Once arriving in Washington, Meadows ousted then-GOP Speaker John Boehner with a parliamentary maneuver, and became the architect of the 2013 government shutdown, as well as multiple Obamacare repeal efforts. And he’s now one of President Donald Trump’s most ardent defenders against impeachment. Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. “The majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said in March. The matter is not settled; judges recently blocked the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections. Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains. And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy – and many politicians – beyond the reach of the ballot box. But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe in amicus briefs before the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath. Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it. Almost 60 million Americans live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election. A new study finds that with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.) Of course, gerrymandering has been part of our politics from the start. The bad news for democracy is that we’re better at gerrymandering than ever before. Powerful computers, sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data – alongside growing polarization – make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state. It’s more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers. Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a path back to power after the party’s 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama. In fact, the GOP invested $30 million into state legislative races in closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck. It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP’s modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map that pushed their advantage in Maryland all the way to 7-1.) But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base. Congress, meanwhile, has an approval rating in the upper teens, yet upward of 95% of incumbents coast to re-election. No wonder Americans feel frustrated. It doesn’t have to be this way. Americans hate gerrymandering and believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado, Ohio and Utah. Many of our national divisions are real and difficult to bridge. Gerrymandering, however, is self-inflicted. We’ve done this to ourselves – but we can undo it, too.

      Fractured America got together on this issue. And it could point the way for more
    ","In this era of extreme political division, one issue is bringing people together: the need to invest in public safety solutions that reduce crime and make the criminal justice system fairer. For the first time in my life, it appears every presidential candidate is running as a champion of criminal justice reform – including (to the shock of many) Donald J. Trump. It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with “lock ‘em up” policies and “tough-on-crime” rhetoric. This dynamic accelerated after George H.W. Bush crushed Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race. Popular wisdom attributed the win to television ads spotlighting a prisoner named Willie Horton, who committed heinous crimes while part of Dukakis’ prison furlough program. Afterward, generations of politicians were afraid to champion prison reform. So, how did justice reform emerge as the one cause that brings people together? The answers are complicated – and surprising. I have a special perspective on the topic. In California, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, which I co-founded in 1996, helped to close five abusive youth prisons; we also blocked construction of a draconian “super jail for youth” near Oakland. Five years ago, I co-founded the Dream Corps’ #cut50 campaign with Jessica Jackson and Matt Haney, through which we passed more than a dozen bipartisan criminal justice bills at the state level, plus last year’s federal First Step Act. This year, I helped launch the REFORM Alliance, which aims to shrink and transform the probation and parole systems. I have dedicated my life to this cause. But I have never seen anything like 2019 – a year in which all presidential candidates and both parties are fighting over who can be trusted to put fewer people behind bars while reducing crime. Any shift of this magnitude has many causes. Let’s explore the top five: 1. The trifecta We are benefiting from an extraordinary trifecta: low crime rates, a strong economy and both parties being fed up with our bloated, ineffective prison system. Politicians can more easily embrace reform when job numbers are up. President Barack Obama helped put the US economy into recovery and, under Trump, unemployment has continued to decline. Now, there are more open jobs in some cities than there are qualified workers. And yet, too many job categories still exclude people with criminal records. But, in this economy, more employers are willing to hire formerly incarcerated people, and more lawmakers are willing to invest in job training, “second chance” and “clean slate” bills to help the formerly incarcerated start new lives. Finally, lawmakers eventually got frustrated investing billions into a system that was failing to rehabilitate a majority of people who came into contact with it. Incarceration fatigue opened the door to new ways of thinking about crime prevention that address underlying causes – like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders began shifting resources to create specialty courts – veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts – across the country. 2. Culture shift The television series, “Orange is the New Black,” brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars. Ava DuVernay’s explosive documentary, “The 13th,” and Netflix series, “When They See Us,” broke hearts. Other documentaries and podcasts, from “Time: The Kalief Browder Story” to “Serial,” opened the public’s eyes. Authors like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson shook the consciences of those who read their works. Shaka Senghor’s bestselling book, “Writing My Wrongs,” won the admiration of Oprah Winfrey and helped to open the floodgates for formerly incarcerated authors. And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Kim Kardashian have become outspoken advocates. This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has the highest incarceration rate in the world. 3. Democratic value: Justice Many people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth. Democrats overwhelmingly backed President Bill Clinton’s disastrous 1994 crime bill. The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction of more than 20 prisons but only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party’s platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform until 2016. So, what changed? Many things – from #BlackLivesMatter to the opioid crisis. Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, they demanded that Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts. Their grass-roots protests also gave Obama a greater impetus and opportunity to champion criminal justice reform. He took full advantage – granting clemency to close to 2,000 inmates, pushing hard for bipartisan legislation and even becoming the first-ever sitting US president to visit a prison. His attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, reshaped the Department of Justice – with a focus on incarcerating fewer people. And, in 2016, Hillary Clinton’s platform included a plank calling for criminal justice reform – an issue no nominee had touched for decades. Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up and insisted that Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice. But Democrats also know the Republicans aren’t going to “Willie Horton” them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause. 4. Republican value: Liberty Many on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can’t believe that Republicans would truly care about a “racial justice” issue. But the truth is that Republicans have their own reasons to oppose the incarceration industry. Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the “tough on crime” system made many communities less safe. Today, many conservatives want an evidence-based system that focuses on reducing crime. They’ve returned to principles that resonate deeply on the right as they joined the fight for reform. One such principle is the need for fiscal prudence with taxpayer dollars and less government waste. Fiscal conservatives balk at the $80 billion annual price tag of mass incarceration. That’s one reason Republican governors, like Rick Perry in Texas and Nathan Deal in Georgia, passed reform bills that saved millions of dollars and (in Texas) even closed several prisons, all while bringing the crime rate down. Another conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach. Libertarians especially don’t want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks. Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich, worry the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for prison reform. Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue. In theory, of course, all conservatives should oppose a big, failed government bureaucracy that produces bad outcomes while eating up taxpayer dollars. America’s massive prison industry today represents a classic case of this phenomenon. And more and more Republicans – from Right on Crime to Faith & Freedom Coalition to The American Conservative Union Foundation – are willing to say so. 5. The Trump factor Then there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump’s decision to release Alice Johnson.  The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family’s arms. We began to hear the President shift from describing himself as “tough on crime” to expressing that he’s tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsed adding sentencing reform to the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year. Because many red state governors took the lead, this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump’s inner circle – including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner – were strong allies. This opened the door for formerly incarcerated people (on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them. People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause – and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump’s decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That’s a good thing for both parties – and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars. I’ve spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities. The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities – but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities – but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That’s why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship – centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties. However, here is what I know: Change is possible – and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of “bipartisan criminal justice reform” was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a cliché. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person. When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter. Criminal justice reform is renewing the right’s dedication to individual “liberty” and deepening the left’s commitment to social “justice.” As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with “liberty” and “justice” for all.

      Conservative: She was not a faceless liberal
    ","I am a political activist by nature. In my home country of Brazil, I helped organize peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power. At the time – way back in 2013 – Brazil was plagued by scandal, with much of the population living in poverty. And yet the country’s politicians, the source of so much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and few others. But with excessive spending on the World Cup draining the country’s already depleted resources, I was able to find a path forward with Brazilians from across the political spectrum. Our collective protests helped lead to a government investigation into corruption. Ultimately, many politicians went to prison, and the country’s president – Dilma Rousseff – was impeached. Shortly after the protests, I moved to the United States on a family visa, where I was granted temporary residency, allowing me the right to work. I then began a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and the financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy. Arriving to this new country, I thought that my activism days were behind me. But then I noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans just trying to get by. Sensing the disconnect – and the growing power of the political elite – I began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter. I advocated for my belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms – and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven’t guessed yet, I’m a Republican, and I support President Donald Trump’s emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans. It was this reemergence in politics – and the divisive rhetoric that often animates it – that motivated me to partake in a Living Room Conversation’s session on immigration. I did so at the invitation of Sue Googe, a fellow Republican and former candidate for North Carolina’s 4th District. Seeing how politically divided America had become – and fearful of its resemblance to parts of Brazil – I knew I had been given a rare opportunity. While Sue and I took a conservative approach to immigration, emphasizing the need to preserve our American values and rule of law, three Democrats argued a more liberal position. One, in particular, stood out to me – Rremida Shkoza, an Albanian refugee to the United States. Rremida, like Sue, had grown up under a communist regime. While Rremida’s family fled Albania, Sue had fled China – but both shared a deep fear and suspicion of communist rule. I, who had experienced Brazilian socialism – which bore eerie similarities to communism with its emphasis on dangerously large government – was also skeptical, having experienced a government descent into corruption. But while Sue and I felt that Democratic socialism – and its liberalism on open borders and expanded government – was a threat to American democracy, Rremida seemed to think it was the solution to many of our problems. Having fled a dictatorship, Rremida felt that the United States had an obligation to keep its doors open to any and all asylum seekers. And while she acknowledged all people entering the United States should be vetted, she believed the government, in an expanded form, could accommodate those in need of refuge and freedom. While I disagreed with her approach, I, too, see the humanitarian issue with refugees seeking asylum. And I lamented the fact that Republicans, while feeling for refugees, fail to clearly express that sentiment publicly. But, unlike Rremida, I know the cost of illegal immigration on the system. As I attempt to navigate the legal system with my family, I bear the heavy weight of having to divide precious resources with immigrants who did not come here through legal means. In Brazil, my mother and brother both depend on each other for income, and while I would love to bring them here to escape the violence, it is almost impossible to bring one without the other. But to bring them here together – following all federal guidelines – could take years, as American courts battle growing immigration backlogs. This is why I told Rremida and her fellow Democrats that the solution to immigration begins by improving the legal system – and channeling the necessary resources to continue to bring the brightest minds across the globe to the US. But it also means cracking down on illegal immigration, building a wall if needed, to dissuade people from coming via that route and jamming up the judicial system with their immigration claims. Rremida, though not entirely agreeing, seemed to understand how my family’s experience was impacting my view of the system. While she may not have endorsed building a wall, she agreed that the distribution of resources on immigration was problematic. Still, despite our differences, I felt she and I shared a common set of values – compassion, patriotism and a belief that our shared country could be a better version of itself. We may disagree on how to accomplish this – through a border wall or increased refugee intake, for example – and we may even disagree on the priorities of the federal government, but we agreed that illegal immigration is a challenge, and comprehensive immigration reform is vital to solving that problem. To know a Democrat also cares about the issue of immigration, but may have a different approach to reforming the system, helps me make peace with our policy differences. Instead of being a faceless liberal, Rremida is now a fellow American with a unique set of experiences that color the way she sees the world – and the role she thinks America should play in it. And our ability to meet in the same living room, to get out of our red vs. blue silos, gives me a tremendous amount of hope. Among the biggest takeaways, I learned that much of the ground work for bridging political divides starts in homes across America. It starts at the community level, where Americans who are already united by ties to a specific place can come together and hash out their differences.

      SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess
    ","In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well. This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995. And a third party that makes it its raison d’etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment. Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up – and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we’re usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren’t good enough. Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders –that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense. Nine of 10 hands shot up. As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border. Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted: “Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it’s time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.” What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters – or who had read recent polls – was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular. According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support. But this was a Democratic primary – the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right? No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn’t. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board. Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters. What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking? This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct. On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day. Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in “the Squad” – Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley – get far more attention than their moderate counterparts. A so-called “alterna-squad,” a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I’ve heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, “Well I can’t vote for Trump, but I’m not with those guys, either.” In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that “finding common ground” is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence “a decent guy.”) Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most “divisive.” Take abortion. “[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,” according to Pew. Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us – the majority – agree it should be legal but with restrictions. Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented. A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn’t those voters feel betrayed by that? Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties’ willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties. While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don’t, what neither seem to get is where they share common ground. Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally – a path to legal status – if they meet some requirements over time. And as it turns out, that’s what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we’re to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally. So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support? Here’s the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn’t as politically profitable as keeping them broken. Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats. Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum. As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to “own the Libs,” and Democratic voters are happy being “the resistance,” it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties. Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years. Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress. All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That’s likely only going to get worse. A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn’t be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn’t take this position or that one, and it wouldn’t have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are. For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican – a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew, a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best. That third party would also lean pro-abortion – keeping Roe v. Wade in place – but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given. It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn’t, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns. It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change. In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn’t on either extreme. There wouldn’t be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn’t have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves. One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can’t, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly. Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus. There’s also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit. So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged. Finally, whether an alternative party in today’s age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn’t swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn’t designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one’s blood pressure almost instantly. Because let’s face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America’s future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we’ll all be politically homeless eventually.

      Confronting the cult of partisan media
    ","America is self-segregating into separate political realities. And partisan media is driving much of this division across new platforms, polarizing for profit while amplifying extreme voices and achieving unprecedented reach – including the Oval Office. President Donald Trump is a creature of partisan media, having kicked off his political career with regular appearances on Fox News. His obsessive consumption causes him to echo its talking points, often overriding information from US intelligence agencies. This leaves him susceptible to conspiracy theories that have now led to the fourth impeachment inquiry in our history. We’ve always had partisan media in America, with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson slashing each other in the pages of competing broadsheets on the same street in Philadelphia. What we’re dealing with today is different because of the pervasive scale of partisan media and its dissemination alongside disinformation. Its proliferation has been hastened by the rise of a partisan economy amid a fragmented media market, aiming to keep a narrow but intense niche audience addicted to anger, anxiety and resentment. But this is a Faustian bargain, because it requires going to ever-increasing extremes to keep the audience engaged while constantly attacking the credibility of nonpartisan news organizations. The rise of social media has balkanized us further, amplifying the loudest voices, often manipulating perceptions of public opinion via anonymous bots and trolls, while driving many reasonable people from the public square of civic debate. These disinformation deployments often shape the tone of partisan media while exploiting the lack of trust it has helped create. The result is real: A new Pew Survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That’s a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems. This is also an unhealthy departure from our best traditions. We had partisan newspapers in the past that, for example, excoriated and defended the New Deal, but there was still a general baseline commitment to facts and a clear delineation between news and editorial opinion. On the broadcast side, the fairness doctrine, introduced in 1949, was a condition of leasing federal airwaves that aimed to ensure balance by requiring time for opposing political views. That doesn’t mean there were not deep disagreements and bitter debate. America was tested by the rise of Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, a conservative, populist anti-communist with a demagogue’s disregard for facts. While accusing Democrats of treason, McCarthy often tried to play the victim of the liberal elite media, equating The Washington Post with the communist Daily Worker – while in fact old-line Republican papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald Tribune were also warning about McCarthy’s tactics. McCarthy’s rise on the back of wild accusations caused some editors to question whether the traditional approach of simply reporting what a public official said was consistent with the larger responsibility of telling the truth. But McCarthy met his match in Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcast news pioneer, who took on McCarthy by fact-checking his public statements, closing his show in March 1954 by saying, “We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. … We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason.” But Murrow vs. McCarthy was a notable exception in a post-war period. Despite the stickiness of who was determining what was fair and balanced, the fairness doctrine proved surprisingly popular among conservatives and liberals who believed it ensured a degree of “public interest” programming. When it was overturned by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987, the Senate voted 59-31 to reinstate it on bipartisan lines – but it was vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan. This is when partisan media as we know it began to proliferate. One study by former chief economist at the FCC Thomas Winslow Hazlett, recounted in his book “The Political Spectrum,” found that talk radio took off after the fairness doctrine was dismantled, displacing what had been the most popular radio format: music. Our country got more polarized as partisan opinion became big business, untethered from any obligation to be fair and balanced. This was the moment Roger Ailes had been waiting for. A one-time talk show producer-turned-political consultant, Ailes pushed a political strategy called “positive polarization” in Richard Nixon’s 1968 presidential campaign. While Nixon repeated “the press is the enemy” like a mantra, Ailes envisioned the creation of a conservative news network that could counteract major newspapers and the big three networks. Ailes had the opportunity to operationalize his partisan dream with the launch of Fox News in 1996. Extending the popularity of right-wing talk radio into cable news, the idea was simple and sinister: Only explicit bias could balance the implicit bias of the mainstream media. But in a breathtaking bit of cynicism, this partisan project would be sold as “fair and balanced.” Later that same year, MSNBC launched and evolved into a liberal counterweight. The partisan media arms race was on. But what is good for ratings can be bad for the country. The impact was clear: Just over a decade later, a Pew Survey on media credibility found that “virtually every news organization or program has seen its credibility marks decline.” Even C-SPAN, which offers unedited coverage of public events, experienced a steep decline in believability. In this hyper-partisan environment, people literally weren’t trusting what they see with their own eyes. Instead of creating more informed citizens, partisan media compounded tribalism through an echo chamber – a loose network of blogs, talk radio and partisan cable news that mainstreamed conspiracy theories and increasingly gave talking points to party leaders rather than vice versa. Then came social media. It promised to break down barriers, but instead of simply being a great leveler, it was quickly hijacked by operatives who realized that it was also the greatest vehicle for disinformation ever devised. All these dynamics contributed to the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency. He took his reality television celebrity and morphed it into political influence with weekly segments on “Fox and Friends,” where he started peddling the birther conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president. But it was his use of Twitter to hijack news cycles with outrageous statements that really boosted his presidential campaign. What Trump understood better than most is that news doesn’t have a liberal or a conservative bias as much as a conflict bias – and he supplied constant conflict in ways that fired up his base while dominating news cycles on stations and sites across the political spectrum. The Republican establishment couldn’t stop his rise, because the conservative base had become radicalized by hyper-partisan media while many on the center-right had opted out of the party. It was a joint effort. During the 2016 campaign, Trump relied on regular strategic conversations with Ailes and Sean Hannity, while bringing on the former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign. Put simply, Trump promoted hyper-partisan media, and they promoted him in return. On the most extreme edge, we even learned that the campaign’s senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, was back-channeling with Breitbart to influence their immigration coverage with white nationalist sites. On a far more prominent and less fringe scale, The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple chronicled Hannity’s many mentions in campaign emails and called him their “chief propagandist … looped in on all their talking points, their deflections and their innumerable attacks.” During the final weeks of the campaign, when few even inside Trump’s orbit believed he could win, Trump was musing about starting his own right-wing television station – Trump TV – to be led by none other than Ailes. It would allow him to monetize the movement he’d begun while continuing its momentum based on the idea that the election had been stolen. But trolls and bots on social media – many of them connected to Russia – were engaging in an all-out final push to try to elect Trump, exploiting the environment of extremism and distrust that partisan media created, posting intentionally fake stories at an accelerated rate. In the final three months of the campaign, the top performing intentionally false stories on Facebook – designed to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton – out-performed the top news stories from actual publications, according to the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report. The top two fake news stories were Pope Francis’ (non-existent) endorsement of Trump and Wikileaks’ “confirmation” of Hillary Clinton’s weapons sales to ISIS – which reached more than 1.7 million people. One analyst explained that “it seems pretty clear that false information outperforms true information.” President-elect Trump quickly tried to twist the term “fake news” – which helped him win the election – to refer to any independent journalism that displeased him in any way. He has used the term more than 1,100 times since inauguration, according to Factba.se, while autocrats around the world approvingly picked up the term. Partisan media was in the White House, and Trump’s relationship with Fox News became something unseen in American history – with the President constantly watching and tweeting out promos to friendly shows while hiring more than 20 administration aides from the extended Fox talent pool. When his staffers burnt out or were forced out, they often found jobs at Fox – while a few lonely correspondents and anchors such as Shepard Smith committed to facts found themselves under fire from viewers as well as the President. “I’ve never seen anything like it before,” Fox News president-turned-NYU journalism professor Joe Peyronnin told The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer. “It’s as if the President had his own press organization. It’s not healthy.” We see that partisan media has completed its takeover of the White House – electing and bolstering an unpopular President while perpetuating a separate political reality for his supporters. But there is a cost to living in that closed environment. The fourth impeachment inquiry in American history was launched because Trump bought into discredited conspiracy theories that Ukraine – not Russia – had hacked the Democratic National Committee while pushing that country’s new President to investigate the family of his chief political rival. These ideas were allegedly spread from interested parties and fringe sites to being investigated by Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani – who fed information to The Hill’s John Solomon – whose articles created “evidence” used to justify the investigation. Solomon would in turn promote his stories on Hannity’s show on Fox News – creating a confirmation bias feedback loop built on falsehoods, or what the President’s supporters might call “alternative facts.” The media coverage of the subsequent impeachment inquiry hearings was also polarized, with one side focused on testimony and facts, while the other side attacked the State Department and White House witnesses as “Never Trumpers,” “nerdy guys,” “radicals,” “partisan bureaucrats” and even a “self-important, very narcissistic diplomatic snowflake.” There’s an inability to agree on basic facts, and instead the politics of personal attacks seem to have aligned with the President’s talking points. There’s no question that partisan media has driven the polarization that’s afflicting our nation. It is driving the agenda in the White House. And proximity to power creates a gravitational pull toward normalization. But the partisan echo chamber is a route to radicalization. As Cass Sunstein explains in his book “Going to Extremes,” “A good way to create an extremist group, or a cult of any kind, is to separate members from the rest of society. The separation can occur physically or psychologically, by creating a sense of suspicion about non-members. With such separation, the information and views of those outside the group can be discredited, and hence nothing will disturb the process of polarization as group members continue to talk.” Partisan media has gone from advancing an ideological agenda to something uglier, something like a cult that is peddling special knowledge – undermining our ability to reason together as Americans, while sharpening tribal divides. Confronting this blizzard of lies is one of the defining challenges of our times. To reunite our nation, we must reassert the old wisdom that says everyone is entitled to their own opinion – but not their own facts – and report without fear or favor. As James Madison said two centuries ago, “To the press alone, checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.” ",2073,opinions,2019-11-22,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/opinions/partisan-media-confronting-political-division-avlon/index.html

      What happens when a patient says, ‘Doc, help me die’
    ","“But can’t you help me die, Doc?” My 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit, with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed, gasping, staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia, he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways, despite our best treatments. As a newly minted doctor years ago, my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients’ care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside, my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed.  That is what I try to do as a physician, including, of course, what they tell me in the silences. I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level.  His face was blank.  “I want euthanasia. I’m going to die soon, so what’s the point of living longer? I’m just wasted space.” I felt nauseated.  The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind.  Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place. I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport, Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father, an engineer, had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days, we’d walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn’t pay anything to Mom, who didn’t make much as a teacher.  So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store. While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided, I was determined to do something different with my life.  Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science, and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people, science and the arts. To me, that meant medicine. I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician, one has constantly to seek truth about the patient’s diagnosis, the best treatment, and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn’t change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane, this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: “Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right.” Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote, from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person’s life has value beyond measure. I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn’t kill another person just because he or she wanted me to, but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul’s request to die. My response came in parts over my days with him.  First, I explained that, as his physician, I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant.  We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected, but I would never intentionally harm him. “Paul, our covenant includes my limiting your suffering,” I said.  “You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain, anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress, but we won’t deliberately end your life.” With our eyes locked, Paul gave his instruction: “Just don’t abandon me.”  And we sat there, as partners. As a physician, there is no better place to be.  Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty, we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship.  He in need of help and me in need of helping. Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms, but it wasn’t enough.  It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease.  Physicians fail our patients on a human level.  We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions, so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art, music, spirituality, pets, sunshine — that might help him. “I want my music.  Can you get me the soundtrack for ‘Lord of the Rings’?”  Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room, and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged.  “I love music. It’s always been a motivator, but now … I don’t know.” He shifted in his bed. “My goals are gone.” Nietzsche’s words came to my mind, “He who has a ‘why’ to live can bear almost any ‘how.’” Viktor Frankl, as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz, used Nietzsche’s quote four times in his crucial analysis, “Man’s Search for Meaning.” I think this book should be required reading for medical students. As with many patients, Paul’s story needed unpacking. “Paul, what did you do in life?” He smiled and shrugged. “I’m a rare beast: a plumber who acts.  I do Shakespeare festivals.  You know, ‘The quality of mercy is not strained.’  I’ve been mulling over that line.  Years ago I didn’t understand it.  I do now.  Mercy should not be forced.  It’s better as a natural infusion, one person to another.” I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director, helping her cue actors.  As we talked, I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover, obliging us to take breaks.  Sweat would build up on his forehead, and, more than once, I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking, and it was essential. That night I asked Christine, a nurse who loves theater, to sit and talk with Paul.  Soon their lives were interwoven, too. “I think I helped Christine,” Paul said the next day. “My own illness made me forget that one of my ‘things’ is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me, but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar.  I told her my way through the worst of it.” He paused, his thoughts far away. It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request.  “Paul, you’ve asked for euthanasia, and you brought up Portia’s line from ‘Merchant of Venice’ about mercy.  Can we talk about these things?”  He nodded, and closed his eyes. “We all want to be here with you in your suffering.  I want your opinion: I don’t think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful, but it would, in every sense of the word, be ‘strained.’ It would be a forced and unnatural ‘false’ mercy.  Whenever possible, mercy must also be lifting and healing.  I don’t want to abandon those key elements in serving you.” His eyes opened wide. “Doc, talking with you and Christine about life’s best and worst times has helped.”  He took a deep breath, and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils.  “Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she’s coming back tonight, and that means the world to me.”  Then, unwittingly, Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: “When we met, I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I’m not a believer like others, but I guess I remembered the ‘why’ to live.” Short of a war zone, there are few settings as raw as an ICU.  Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their “why,” even if just for an hour or a day. I see many paths toward survival in the ICU, and for non-survivors, myriad paths toward death: sudden, prolonged, stuttering, reluctant, stoical – and these paths are dynamic, not static. It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia, but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering.  Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears, the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain. Lack of control is what bothers people the most, and it drives most requests for euthanasia, which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon.  As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives, looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate.  As a physician, I find this is a very important “teachable moment” for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata, these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind, and I recalled them for Paul: “Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.” He nodded in agreement. Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community. The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of ‘cure,’ when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received. And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are. Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won’t be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul’s story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same. We are sent to heal even when cure is not possible.  What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person’s sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person. Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: “I’m glad I didn’t miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. … In losing my breath, I gained it.” Note: The patient’s name and age have been changed for privacy.  These conversations reproduce Paul’s words as accurately as possible from the author’s memory.

      Together we make a family
    ","I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn’t ask me. He didn’t even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, “While you’re down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?” At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: “No!” As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren’t seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate. The delivery room wasn’t my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn’t always perfect for me growing up.  My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, “Kids like you don’t go here, you go to the special school.” If it weren’t for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me. I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be “different” in a way that he is not. Everyone’s “normal” is their own: Share your story of how you use being different to make a difference in your own life or others’ with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415 When he comes, I’ll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I’ve always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery. With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist  – who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn’t ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business.   I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation – which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure. I don’t know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I’ve asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children. While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it’s also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing. Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it). My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world, affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year. My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities. I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor’s and master’s degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively. I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith’s latest film, “Dogma,” and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school. It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm – and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over. All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the “gay cancer,” my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two. I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, “We’re here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They’re no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we’d hope they would be here for us.” And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north. When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. “Mom, I think I want to be clown.” She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. “What?” she asked. “Yeah, I think I want to be a clown.” We rode home in silence. I didn’t realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously. I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom. Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller, an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read “for fun.” My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010. Taking this path was important to me – and to my family as well. When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school.   It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn’t have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having “midget midget” shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States. Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis. My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos, the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job – at Victoria’s Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager. You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, “You have to make someone want something they don’t need and want to pay too much for it.” My boss at Victoria’s Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I’d have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store. I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They’d actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. “Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit.” (We all wore black suits). “Well, she’s petite.” (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general. The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were “fascinated” with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, “We could pick you up and walk out with you. We’d take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us.” I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened “spidey sense” because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help. Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth. I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away – cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by “staring at the new girl.” I have no memory of this. Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads. Patrick is average height and African-American. I’m a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I’m the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he’s the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work. When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that’s how those of us in the community refer to “little people”) friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn’t ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height – they’d ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn’t care either way. I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama’s White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, “I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules.” And those are really the values that we stress as we’re raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya. At age 6, Jackson’s awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, “Mom, you’re white, Dad’s black, and I’m peach.” His dad turned around and said “Peach? You’re black.” Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said “Peach!” This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been. We’ve purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It’s  important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults. Since we’re raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband’s childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can’t – and in some cases, shouldn’t – be the one to answer. As a professional advocate, I’ve spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police – Eric Garner, Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland – were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died. Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now – their curiosity, their feeling that they’ve never met a stranger, their trust in the world – could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place. My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn’t keep it from him. When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn’t be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well. Whether it’s forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the “well-meaning” nondisabled public for centuries. No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents. Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent’s disability. In my work as an advocate, I’ve spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw. If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language.  Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like “special needs,” “differently abled,” or, in a pun on language from the past, “handi-capable.” These aren’t words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with – they were defined by society because the concept of “disability” makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It’s a reminder that yes, we are different. But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that “disability” is something to be ashamed of – say, by implying that someone shouldn’t have more children because of one – society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights.  We didn’t celebrate the 27th anniversary of the “Americans with Special Needs Act” this summer, after all. The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT – with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police – and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for. They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live – in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims. We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It’s impossible not to – and we would be irresponsible if we didn’t. We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don’t have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women’s march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn’t I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, “I am the mommy,” but not a single one apologized to me. As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable. Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don’t know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don’t care either way. What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

      Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option
    ","It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids. My heart dropped. She didn’t know me at all. I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me – and it isn’t the first. On the day that I turned 30, I journaled that I would think about becoming a mother should I still be single at 38. What that looked like, I didn’t exactly know. It was a promise to myself, maybe to God. At the time, I was in a terrible relationship with a man who told me he wanted to be with me, but he could never love me. It was because of those words that I first clung to the idea of motherhood. Maybe a man could deny me love, but he would never deny me a child. Fast forward to my 38th birthday. I was still single, and the world of dating had changed significantly in the last eight years. Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal. Every family is different: Share your story of how IVF, adoption or your unique family structure has shaped your life with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415 Dating amounted to small talk with a stranger, who you had briefly interfaced with online because you each thought the other attractive. The small talk was a prelude to hooking up, and there were no expectations even of a text the next day. It was brutal. And after trying my hand at it, I was no closer to finding the love of my life or starting a family. If I needed statistics to back me up, I had them. In 2014, marriage was on the decline, as was the fertility rate in the United States. I had one real option left – and that was to attempt to get pregnant alone. Maybe I didn’t deserve a family, or so many of the subscribers to my conservative Christian values might say. And maybe the men with whom I had been involved didn’t view me as acceptable wife/mother material. But deep down I felt differently and decided to give myself one shot. And so I started the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). I was mentally prepared for the physical havoc that would ensue, and I had saved every penny for it – to the tune of $30,000. But why didn’t I adopt? After all, even if I were fortunate enough to have a child, the child would be fatherless. And many, myself included, believe this places the child in a precarious situation. That said, at least with IVF my potential child would be biologically related to me, his or her grandparents and cousins. The child might not have a father, but he or she would have a strong bloodline.  I hoped this would help ease any future struggle for my child. The very decade I was born into – the glorious 70’s – ushered in the science and technology that might allow me to conceive. Alone. More specifically, 1978 was the year that the first human being was born through the process of embryo creation outside of the womb, then implantation inside of the womb, pregnancy and successful birth. Since that time, IVF has produced approximately 5 million babies, with nearly 1 million of those being born in the United States. The IVF pool is quite minuscule compared to total US births – for example, in 2011, only 0.7% of all US births were attributed to IVF. That said, and barely optimistic, I was committed to the process, or so I thought. And yet there I was  at a bar in Los Angeles, a month out from IVF, crying in front of two people I barely knew, but knew well enough to unload to. My life was great on paper. I had done all the right things. I went to Stanford for graduate school. I worked at the White House under Condoleezza Rice. I had the opportunity to travel the world. I had loving parents and two wonderful sisters. And yet I felt unloved – even unlovable. And also greatly conflicted. On the one hand, I was ecstatic – I was weeks away from my shot at becoming a biological mom. I started thinking about this potential path nine years ago and had been setting aside money for five years. I was in love with idea of having a family and giddy at the thought of the unknown. But there was doubt. Goodness, there was doubt. There was that little voice inside my head – the voice of my parents and others – that was very much alive in me. “Why would you purposely bring a child into the world without a father? Are you really that lonely? How would that child feel one day?” Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it’s wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish. My heart and my brain had to fight back. No, I was not that lonely. No, I was not that selfish.  Actually, it was waking up single, every single day of my life – only to be greeted by my career – that felt selfish. And while I could never speak for the feelings that my future child might have, I took solace in the belief that any child would be happy to be alive if he or she were sincerely loved. As I drew nearer to the implantation date, the prospect of creating a tiny human grew more real and began to override any lingering doubt. And so, on August 29, 2014, I asked my doctor to implant two embryos. He wisely asked me to justify two. I was quick to answer. If I were lucky enough to get pregnant with twins – what a gift for them. They may not have a father, but they would always have each other. I knew the statistics and did not expect to get pregnant. Given my age and the means of conception, I was praying for the long shot of one, knowing two would be a miracle. The 2014 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report, as published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, is a humbling reminder of just how small the odds were during the year that I attempted to conceive. In 2014, a woman of my age, using fresh non-donor eggs with no previous pregnancies, had an 18.8% chance of pregnancy resulting in a live birth. When it came to percentages of cycles resulting in twin lives births, the success rate plummeted to 3.7%. Yes, I had a 3.7% chance of success. Of course, before the IVF process could begin, I had to choose a donor – and let’s just say I took a less than conventional approach. Given my professional background as a conservative politico, I think people expect me to say that IQ, number of educational degrees and political association were at the top of my donor qualifications list. Not the case. I was looking for someone who I would be attracted to if we were procreating in the traditional way. I know this must sound incredibly superficial. But, let’s be frank, it’s impossible to gauge true intellect or a kind heart by virtue of an online donor search. And so I began my search with a focus on the physical attributes that I have always been attracted to – namely height and athleticism. Six-foot-2 and toned was my baseline. The donor was a collegiate lacrosse athlete. I was able to see three pictures, from tot to teen, of an adorable boy with an incredible smile, unruly hair and a twinkle in his eyes. (This particular bank did not allow adult pictures of the donor for legal reasons. So, at the end of the day, the attraction part of my search was also a gamble.) I finished my search on the scientific side of things. The donor bank I chose provided a full medical history and genetic testing results. Honestly, why wouldn’t you opt for a donor with no heart disease, cancer, mental illness or any other serious genetic conditions in his family history? This is the one distinct advantage of going the donor route as opposed to the good old-fashioned route when conceiving. While I haven’t polled my married or attached friends, I am 99.9% certain that not a single one queried their partner about the specifics of their family’s medical history prior to sleeping with them or accepting a marriage proposal. I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans – at least on paper. In early September, my blood work came back with hormone levels signaling pregnancy. I was in shock, but I had eight long weeks to go until seeing if there was a heartbeat or two. I started to take a pregnancy test every evening. It was the longest 56 days of my life. D-Day finally arrived. And, there on the sonogram screen right in front of me, was the most beautiful thing: my child’s heartbeat, strong and steady. I had a million immediate questions for the sonographer and started right in. She stopped me, because there was heartbeat number two. Wait, what? I was laughing and crying at the same time. This must be what joy feels like, I thought. The cliché that I despise most is: It will happen when you least expect it. Nonsense. I had gone almost 40 years expecting nothing in terms of dating, love and, God forbid, a husband – and I received exactly that in return. But suddenly the least expected had happened. I was pregnant with twins. My journal entry from the evening read as follows: Week 8, Day 1: October 6th D Day Dear God: Thank you. Baby A: your heartbeat was 159 today. Baby B: your heartbeat was 168. I love you A & B.  Please keep growing. You’re looking great. Thank you, God. I pray for their development – from their fingers to their toes. From brain to nose. I am so grateful for these precious beings. Prepare me to be the strong parent – fiscally and spiritually – that they will need me to be. Love you. On a Friday morning roughly 30 weeks after implantation, something seemed wrong. I had such severe leg cramps that I was crawling around the apartment on my hands and knees. I called an Uber at 8:30 am. Never having taken any birthing classes, I had no idea what the onset of labor looked like. By the time I got to the hospital the pain was so intense that I could barely make it to the door. The Uber driver offered to help me up. I was immediately checked in and within minutes was told that I was 7 cm dilated and would be headed into an emergency C-section. My heart stopped. I was petrified that those little heartbeats were going to stop and that my sons – my sons – were not going to make it. I was alone in the pre-delivery room just long enough to run through every awful scenario in my head. And then it was time. Seventy minutes after arrival, I was wheeled into a room with a team of 16 doctors and nurses waiting for me. The sight of this army, the two waiting incubators and all the other metal contraptions made me well up. I had no idea what was going to happen next, but I had never expected it to happen quite like this – not this early, not with these many medical professionals and not entirely on my own. Doctors and nurses were working quickly all around me. Epidural, check. Babies’ heart rates, check. Slicing me open, check. Ripping two crimson-colored sons out of me at 10:40 am and 10:43 am, check and check. I saw Eli and Abel for a nanosecond before the nurses cut the cords and rushed them to their incubator stations to begin inserting the breathing tubes. They were 10 weeks premature and neither could suck, swallow or breathe on their own. The two teams whisked my babies to the Level 4 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) without me getting to touch their skin or ask if their vital signs were stable. I did hear them cry, which was a relief.  I just wish my sisters had been there to take a picture and help recount what happened. I can’t ever get that moment back. Little did I know when I moved to Denver that I would be delivering twins two years later at Denver’s premier NICU hospital – The Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian St. Luke’s I was not able to see my sons until nine very long hours after delivery. I walked into a room with two incubators housing my baby boys, who looked more like starved squirrels than the roly-poly infants that I had envisioned. All wired up, with IVs jutting out of the top of their skulls, they were absolutely perfect. Complete miracles from inception to emergency birth. And, of course, they chose Friday the 13th of March to scare the living hell out of me and fight their way onto this Earth. Two weeks after I was released from the hospital, I found myself sleeping in my Denver home of almost two years, as my boys lived and slept inside NICU – for 60 days straight. And though I could easily have felt alone – so removed from my two miracles – I didn’t. Friends and family from across the country constantly checked in on me, calling, texting, writing me words of encouragement. And even once Eli and Abel were out of NICU, loving and supporting friends – and sometimes even strangers –continued to shower us with kindness and affection. Initially, the NICU team was our rock. These complete strangers became the most significant and consequential people in the lives of my sons during their first two months. I will never be able to appropriately express my gratitude to the nurses and doctors who safeguarded their lives. Several are friends to this day. Then my personal trainer and his wife, the first people to visit me in the hospital, became the most trusted and consistent presence in our lives. From celebrating our birthdays, to helping with our apartment move, to Fourth of July and Super Bowl celebrations, to just being those adult ears that I need – Adam and Teri have been there for all of it. The mother of twin boys, who lived steps away from me, became my sanity check. We were pregnant at the same time and delivered within weeks of each other. We met by fluke, thanks to a double stroller sighting in the alley. And the parents of my first employee proved invaluable, babysitting the boys on weekends so I could nap. I can’t forget the British transplant, who regularly delivered homemade quiche on weeknights just because. More recently, though, the manager at the Palm (steakhouse) took care of my family. It was Thanksgiving night, and I took the twins for our first holiday fête as a family of three. In one of the most random acts of kindness, the manager worked her way to our table, poured me a glass of wine, helped feed the boys, shared a bit of her life story with me and then bought our meal. She did not know me. Most importantly, since the birth of Eli and Abel, my parents have fallen so completely in love with their grandsons that it’s hard to fully put into words the intensity of their connection. What was at first an idea hard for my traditional parents to grasp, is now two, tiny human beings, who have my parents tightly wrapped around their little fingers. Though thousands of miles away, my parents – and my sisters – express their love and support constantly and in innumerable ways. There are incredible people in this world. My sons’ existences have made that real to me. Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear – the hardest, yet best thing I’ve ever done. My sons are my family and my future. They represent everything good, hopeful and hilarious about life. They smile and cheer when I walk into their room. They blow kisses and sneak hugs. They belly laugh when we dance. They cuddle up at night and put their heads in the crook of my neck. They also scream, bite and bang their heads on the floor when they’re upset. They chuck their food when they don’t like it. They act like the world is coming to an end at bath time. And they are a constant financial stress.  Being a single parent is hard as hell. But from my two little men, I quickly internalized that love is a verb. Love is an action and something you work at every single day. You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before. Speaking of love, friends like to tell me that there is a man out there – some wonderful man who will sweep me off my feet and be an excellent father. To that I say, please stop. Do I want to date? Of course. But I can honestly write that I have no expectations for love, and I certainly do not believe that there is a father out there for my sons. I am not waiting and hoping, because I have lost that hope. Why have I lost that hope? Truth be told, I have been vulnerable with a few men pre- and post-pregnancy. But rejection upon rejection by man after man will do it to you. Even when you are that aloof gal, who doesn’t ask questions or have expectations of something real or long-term, it still ends. I guess you just lose your luster after awhile. It’s my reality, and it never changes. And while we are on the topic of relationships, I would note that I will forever be perplexed by the rate of unsolicited and unexpected congratulatory communications from ex-boyfriends after years of no contact. These were the men who rejected me. These were the men who left after months or years of pretending and/or cheating. After the birth of my sons, these same men suddenly thought they had a green card to strike up conversation and ask for pictures of the twins. One suggested grabbing dinner in DC. One kindly offered to come to Colorado to help run errands, cook dinner or do whatever I needed. The attention was hard to digest. I once cried over these men. Perhaps this was a way of absolving their guilt for being dishonest or wasting my time? Perhaps they were sincerely happy for me, which would suggest that they did respect me after all? Perhaps they were feeling slighted or envious that I went it alone, without them? I’ll never know. And, most importantly, I finally no longer care. Though I may never have a significant other, I do have my sons, who’ve taken me from unloved to loved and from unlovable to lovable. They’ve done this all on their own. They are my miracles, which I almost didn’t allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing. Prior to Eli and Abel, I wasted at least half of my adult life obsessing about things I had lost – men who broke my heart, clients who weren’t a good fit, friendships that had faded. My sons taught me to focus on the miracles that are right in front of my eyes every single day, beginning with my 3.7%.

      We asked, you answered: How IVF and adoption changed your lives
    ","On Tuesday, CNN Opinion published “Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option,” a personal essay by Sarah Lenti, a political strategist who decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF).  She writes: “I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me – and it isn’t the first.” Lenti’s piece was the first of a CNN Opinion series, “What it’s like to be me,” which explores personal struggles Americans face in a time of social change. We asked you, CNN’s audience, to share your stories of IVF and adoption through text message and WhatsApp – and you responded with personal experiences that were as various as they were emotionally compelling. You shared with us stories of your joys and your struggles. You shared family photos – and some of you even sent us videos about your families’ journeys. Here they are. “The article I just read in CNN on a single mom by choice hit home. My daughter just turned 1 and I too began this journey a little less than two years ago. I will be 38 in May and I always wanted a family. I dated someone long-term and when that relationship ended, by the time I finished licking my wounds, I was 36 with no prospects. I went on every online dating site and never met anyone worth my time. I decided to give insemination a try. I conceived relatively quickly. It was the best decision for me. I know another friend who went this route and after sharing my story many more friends are interested in becoming single moms by choice. It’s not that I don’t want a partner, I just didn’t want my opportunity to become a mother to pass me by in the meantime. “(The article) made me happy to know that more women are not afraid to say how they conceived their babies outside of “traditional relationships.” That we are taking control of our lives, our fertility and bringing babies into this world that are wanted and loved before they are even conceived.” “Blessed and fortunate to have my own modern family thanks to surrogacy. “Our dream of having a baby started in 2014, the year we got married. We found a surrogacy agency in an IVF practice in Connecticut. We were matched with our first surrogate in 2015 and she got pregnant right away, but sadly she had a miscarriage at eight-and-a-half weeks. We were devastated and upset, naturally, but we knew we didn’t want to give up because we really wanted to have a baby. So we waited and we tried again and were matched with another surrogate in 2016 and she also got pregnant right away, but this time she carried the baby to 38-and-a-half weeks and we had Chelsea. “We feel really lucky and fortunate to have Chelsea because we know how difficult it can be to have a baby in untraditional ways. Even if you have all the means and resources necessary that doesn’t always guarantee a baby. “ “My name is Jo Zmood. I am a single mum of two now. Originally from Australia – hence “mum” not “mom.” I’ve lived in New York for 10 years, and while there are many books out there that talk about different types of families I couldn’t quite find the right book to share with my son to provide him some explanation of my choice to bring him into this world alone. So I wrote my own story for him. The article inspired me to share it. “He never asked any questions and understands some of his friends have dads and some don’t. I wanted to answer his question of why he doesn’t, regardless of whether the question is posed. And to let him know the subject was not taboo.” “During the three years I struggled to get pregnant with my second child as a solo parent, people close to me asked if I should consider the failed pregnancies a sign to give up. I was not giving up. The years of navigating fibroid tumors, surgeries and infertility finally came to an end with the birth of my second son, Oliver. He was born with my eggs and the help of my cousin as my surrogate. My journey as a solo parent also ended when I met my husband right before learning my surrogate was pregnant with Oliver. We were both solo parents in our 40s and had never been married before. Our journey to building a family may not have taken a typical path, but what we have today is my dream come true.” Kim Overton writes about her experience on her website.

My ex-husband couldn’t have children either so we adopted two babies within three years. The marriage ended a few years later and I remarried the following year. My new husband and I started our married life with two 4-year-olds and a 2-year-old. “Then the surprises came. I had babies at age 35, 39, and 46 – – all conceived the old-fashioned way!” “I am a US-Belgian dual citizen, single mom, living in Brussels After many failed attempts (albeit fun) at a real relationship, I decided to have a child on my own. Having a supportive family, especially my sister living in Belgium, was one of the reasons I did not hesitate to go solo. “When the adoption agency called me saying that they had received the picture of my daughter, I ran to go see her photo. “After an exhausting trip, arrived late into the night in Changsha, capital of the Hunan province, we went to the office of child affairs, or something of the sort, and each waited until we were called and they brought the babies out one by one. I looked at her as they were putting her in my arms, the most amazing and unreal feeling possible. She cried right away and I put a pacifier in her mouth and it calmed her right away. “What I remember most, is putting her on a chair in the hotel room and just staring at this little bundle of baby and saying, I cannot believe she is mine! The wait had not been too long (seven months for China to pair me up with Lynne and from the start of the process of first meeting with the agency to the file being sent was about 12 months, so all in all, about one-and-a-half years – so not too long).” “She got attached to me immediately and when we were in the dining hall, I could not even leave her in her buggy to get food, she had to come with me and see me. The nannies had told me that she was always crawling behind one or the other person at the orphanage so she had to be in someone’s company at all times. “She still does not like being alone! She loves being close to me and needs company to be happy, even if now, as a teen, she can spend hours in her room doing who knows what! I call her my little pot of glue. “Adopting is not easy. I mean being a single mom, making all the decisions, is hard. And having a smart child, ahead of her years for some things, is challenging to say the least. Also, an abandoned child’s brain develops differently and this is why sometimes, they rebel against us and make life very hard. They try, albeit unconsciously, to do all they can to push us away. They are repeating the abandonment they felt as a child. But you have to hold fast, hold on and show you are always there.

We’d like to go to Japan next! “All in all, being a mom is the toughest job. It is also the most rewarding. I do not know how they decide which parent gets which child in China, but I would not have wanted any other. It had to be her, no one else. I love her with all my heart. And I do get the love back.

We maintain a relationship with his birth family, which I am very thankful for. Although it hasn’t been easy, it has been worth it. He brings so much joy to myself and my family. He’s such a wonderful, loving little boy.  Even those that weren’t on board with my choice to pursue adoption at such a young age are just simply amazed at how incredibly perfect he is for our family. We love him with every ounce of our being. “The one aspect of the adoption that I feel I wasn’t prepared for was the current environment that I am raising a black son in. I have always tried to be a strong advocate for the AA community and to stay educated, but never really understood what it meant to be black in America until I saw the world through my son’s eyes. Although I still don’t fully understand, as I myself am shielded with my own privilege, my eyes have been opened. Sometimes painfully so. I worry about him every day. But, he is my world and I would do it again in a heart beat.” ",1892,opinions,2017-04-28,https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/opinions/opinions-ivf-adoption-reaction/index.html

      What happened when my dad met a bully
    ","As a child, my dad was so small that people called him Minnow. His size often invited teasing, ridicule and bullying. One day in grade school, it culminated with an older (and much larger) bully challenging my dad to a fight in front of everyone after school. As my dad would tell me, his stomach was tied in knots for the rest of the day. He didn’t want to fight, and he knew that if he did fight, he almost certainly would get beat up. Hounded by giddy classmates all day — “Minnow, what are you gonna do?” — my dad told them that he would show up for the fight. He knew that if he cowed, the bully would be emboldened and things for everyone would only get worse. Frothy excitement engulfed the school as news spread that Minnow would fight the bully. Finally, the school bell rang, and my dad walked to the specified location, followed by a throng of curious classmates. Fear gripped him. When my dad finally arrived, the bully wasn’t there. My dad waited. And waited. The bully never showed. My dad said he learned an important lesson that day. For bullies, fear and intimidation is their oxygen. Fear and intimidation give them power. And while some bullies will fight, a great many more are relying on you to cower — it is the secret of their power. As things turned out, “Mellow Minnow,” as he was known, would later become a Golden Gloves boxer and would finish his career as one of the top flyweights in the United States. He said that during the Korean War, a few larger GIs made the mistake of trying to push him around. Most people who knew my dad would never have guessed this part of his history –— that the affable, kind, quiet and self-deprecating Iowa native with bifocals and a comb-over was once a fighter, and that he would stand up for himself, for others and for what was right, if needed. Ever since the Trump mob followed the call of their leader and descended on the Capitol on January 6, I have thought a lot about the parallels of my dad’s story and the fears many of us have felt. Some members of Congress reportedly voted against electoral certification on January 6 because they were afraid for their physical safety. MAGA bullies threatened to descend on state capitals with more violence. They threatened to attack Washington, DC. They showed us their guns and hatred. Fear ensued, and some argued that this week’s presidential inauguration should be moved indoors. Others suggested that we should “go easy” on the insurrectionists so as not to trigger more terror and violence. Instead, people decided to stand up to the bullies. In recent weeks, hundreds of domestic terrorists have been arrested. People across the political spectrum have stepped up and identified radicalized friends or family members who participated in the insurrection. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in impeaching our top bully, despite numerous death threats from the mob he egged on. Local and state Republicans have been recognized for refusing to be bullied into overturning election results in their communities. Even the losing vice president refused to leave the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, determined to execute his duty and protect our democracy even as the MAGA mob hunted for him in the Capitol, chanting, “Hang Mike Pence.” More than 25,000 soldiers arrived in Washington DC, to face any bullies who might show up with their guns, swastikas, Confederate flags and bully clubs. And this week President Biden took the oath of office outdoors, right where the attempted coup had unfolded only fourteen days earlier. People faced their fears, and they ensured the orderly and democratic transfer of power. People stood up to the bullies, who never showed up. That includes our top bully, who chose to flee town. This week we are reminded that fear and intimidation are diminished when people come together and stand up to the bullies. We have learned that there are enough leaders (and citizens) who will not appease — because history tells us that appeasing fascists, thugs and bullies never works. People stood up for what was right, and the bullies lost a bit of their dark power. I wasn’t planning on sharing the story of my late father. Then this weekend as I cleaned out our office closet, I found a photo of him and his American Legion boxing team — Minnow, the little guy who faced his fears and stood up to the bully, and in doing so found new power and light.

      One of India’s trash mountains is on fire again and residents are choking on its toxic fumes
    ","Firefighters in the southern Indian city of Kochi were toiling Tuesday to control toxic fumes from spreading after a landfill burst into flames five days ago, cloaking the area in a thick haze and choking residents. The towering Brahmapuram landfill in Kerala state is the country’s latest trash mountain to catch fire, causing dangerous heat and methane emissions, and adding to India’s growing climate challenges. Authorities advised residents in the city of more than 600,000 to remain indoors or wear N95 face masks if they head outside. Schools were forced to close on Monday as a result of the pollution, officials said. The blaze broke out last Thursday, according to Kerala’s fire department. The cause has not been established, but landfill fires can be triggered by combustible gases from disintegrating garbage. Images and video released by officials showed workers racing to extinguish the billowing flames that sent thick plumes of toxic smoke rising high into the sky. While the fire has been largely put out, a thick cloud of smoke and methane gas continues to cover the area, reducing visibility and the city’s air quality, while emitting a lingering, pungent odor. Some firefighters had fainted from the fumes, the fire department said. Kerala’s top court said it will take up the case on Tuesday. India creates more methane from landfill sites than any other country, according to GHGSat, which monitors emissions via satellites. Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide – but it is a more potent contributor to the climate crisis because it traps more heat. As part of his “Clean India” initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal, if achieved, could relieve some of the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these enormous dump sites – and help the world lower its greenhouse gas emissions. But while India wants to lower its methane output, it hasn’t joined the 150 countries that have signed up to the Global Methane Pledge, a pact to collectively cut global emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Scientists estimate the reduction could cut global temperature rise by 0.2% – and help the world reach its target of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius. India says it won’t join because most of its methane emissions come from farming – some 74% from farm animals and paddy fields versus less than 15% from landfill. In 2021, India’s environment minister Ashwini Choubey said pledging to reduce the country’s total methane output could threaten the livelihood of farmers and impact the economy. But environmentalists say the country is facing a dire climate challenge from its steaming mounds of trash. Brahmapuram is just one of some 3,000 Indian landfills overflowing with decaying waste and emitting toxic gases. Commissioned in 2008, the landfill is spread across 16 acres, according to a 2020 report from the International Urban Cooperation, a European Union program. The landfill receives about 100 metric tons of plastic waste each day, the study added, of which only about 1% is suitable for recycling. The remaining 99% is dumped as a heap at the site, the study said, calling it a “menace for the municipal corporation.” “The plastic dump at Brahmapuram is increasing in size day by day,” it said. “It has seen several fires over the past few years, thus polluting the air and the environment.” Despite its growing size and threats, the landfill is not India’s largest. The Deonar dumping ground in the western coastal city of Mumbai, which stands at some 18 stories high, claims the top spot. Deonar has also seen sporadic fires break out, enveloping about a million residents in the nearby Chembur, Govandi and Mankhurd suburbs. There is no formal processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government’s Central Pollution Board. Rag pickers from nearby slums often trek up the towering mounds and scour through the waste for a few cents per day, but they are not trained in properly segregating it. In some cases, the trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads. Last year, firefighters worked for days to extinguish flames after a fire broke out at Delhi’s Ghazipur landfill – the capital city’s largest. Standing at 65 meters (213 feet), it is nearly as tall as the historic Taj Mahal, becoming a landmark in its own right and an eyesore that towers over surrounding homes, affecting the health of people who live there. And methane emissions aren’t the only hazard that stem from the landfill. Over decades, dangerous toxins have seeped into the ground, polluting the water supply for thousands living nearby. At Bhalswa, one of Delhi’s other large landfills, residents have complained of deep, painful skin gashes and respiratory issues from years of living near the hazardous mound. In a 2019 report, the Indian government recommended ways to improve the country’s solid waste management, including formalizing the recycling sector and installing more compost plants in the country. While some improvements have been made, such as better door-to-door garbage collection and processing of waste, India’s landfills continue to grow in size. And as the country is expected to soon overtake China as the the world’s most populous nation, climate experts fear time to act upon the issue is running out.

      Grand test for Indian diplomacy as American, Chinese and Russian ministers meet in Delhi
    ","Foreign ministers from the world’s biggest economies convened in New Delhi Thursday in what was seen as a grand test for Indian diplomacy, which ultimately didn’t succeed in reaching a consensus because of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. In the second high-level ministerial meeting under India’s Group of 20 (G20) presidency this year, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, met his American, Chinese and Russian counterparts, hoping to find enough common ground to deliver a joint statement at the end of the summit. But amid festering divisions over Moscow’s war, New Delhi was unable to convince the leaders to put their differences aside, with Jaishankar admitting the conflict had struggled to unite the group. India, the world’s largest democracy with a population of more than 1.3 billion, has been keen to position itself as a leader of emerging and developing nations – often referred to as the Global South – at a time when soaring food and energy prices as a result of the war are hammering consumers already grappling with rising costs and inflation. Those sentiments were front and center during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opening remarks earlier Thursday, when he spoke of multiples crises the world faces, with less wealthy nations hit especially hard. “The experience of the last few years, the financial crisis, climate change, the pandemic, terrorism and wars clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said. “We must also admit that the tragic consequences of this failure are being faced most over by the developing countries,” who he says are most affected by global warming “caused by richer countries”. Eluding to the war in Ukraine, Modi acknowledged the conflict was causing “deep global divisions.” But he encouraged the foreign ministers to put differences aside during their meeting Thursday. “We should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can,” he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the summit, according to a State Department official traveling with Blinken. Blinken and Lavrov spoke for roughly 10 minutes, the same official said. Russian Ministry of Foreign affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but played down its significance. “Blinken asked for contact with Lavrov. On the go, as part of the second session of the twenty, Sergey Viktorovich (Lavrov) talked. There were no negotiations, meetings, etc,” she said. Deep disagreements over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine played out in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru last month as well, when G20 finance chiefs failed to agree on a statement after their meeting. Both Russia and China declined to sign the joint statement, which criticized Moscow’s invasion. That left India to issue a “chair’s summary and outcome document” in which it summed up the two days of talks and acknowledged disagreements. Analysts say that throughout the war New Delhi has deftly balanced its ties to Russia and the West, with Modi emerging as a leader who has been courted by all sides. But as the war enters its second year, and tensions continue to rise, pressure could mount on countries, including India, to take a firmer stand against Russia – putting Modi’s statecraft to the test. Arguably India’s most celebrated event of the year, the G20 summit has been heavily promoted domestically, with sprawling billboards featuring Modi’s face plastered across the country. Roads have been cleaned and buildings freshly painted ahead of the dignitaries’ visit. Taking place in the “mother of democracies” under Modi’s leadership, his political allies have been keen to push his international credentials, portraying him as a key player in the global order. Last year’s G20 leaders’ summit in Bali, Indonesia, issued a joint declaration that echoed what Modi had told Russian President Vladimir Putin weeks earlier on the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan. “Today’s era must not be of war,” it said, prompting media and officials in India to claim India had played a vital role in bridging differences between an isolated Russia and the United States and its allies. India, analysts say, prides itself on its ability to balance relations. The country, like China, has refused to condemn Moscow’s brutal assault on Ukraine in various United Nations resolutions. Rather than cutting economic ties with the Kremlin, India has undermined Western sanctions by increasing its purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer. But unlike China, India has grown closer to the West – particularly the US – despite ties with Russia. New Delhi’s ties with Moscow date back to the Cold War, and the country remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for military equipment – a vital link given India’s ongoing tensions with China at its shared Himalayan border. The US and India have taken steps in recent months to strengthen their defense partnership, as the two sides attempt to counter the rise of an increasingly assertive China. Daniel Markey, senior adviser, South Asia, for the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), said while India’s leaders “would like to facilitate an end to this conflict that preserves New Delhi’s relations with both Washington and Moscow and ends the disruption of the global economy,” India did not have “any particular leverage” with Russia or Ukraine that would make a settlement likely. “I believe that other world leaders are equally interested in playing a peace-making diplomatic role. So when and if Putin wishes to come to the table to negotiate, he will have no shortage of diplomats hoping to help,” he said. Still, as Putin’s aggression continues to throw the global economy into chaos, India has signaled an intention to raise the many concerns faced by the global South, including climate challenges and food and energy security, according to Modi’s opening speech earlier Thursday. “The world looks upon the G20 to ease the challenges of growth, development, economic resilience, disaster resilience, financial stability, transnational crime, corruption, terrorism, and food and energy security,” Modi said. While Modi’s government appears keen to prioritize domestic challenges, experts say these issues could be sidelined by the tensions between the US, Russia and China, which have increased recently over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort. Speaking to reporters last week, Ramin Toloui, the US assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, said while Secretary of State Antony Blinken would highlight its efforts to address food and energy security issues, he would also “underscore the damage that Russia’s war of aggression has caused.” Blinken will “encourage all G20 partners to redouble their calls for a just, peaceful, and lasting end to the Kremlin’s war consistent with UN Charter principles,” Toloui said. At the same time, Russia in a statement Wednesday accused the US and the European Union of “terrorism,” stating it was “set to clearly state Russia’s assessments” of the current food and energy crisis. “We will draw attention to the destructive barriers that the West is multiplying exponentially to block the export of goods that are of critical importance to the global economy, including energy sources and agricultural products,” Russia said, hinting at the difficulties New Delhi might face during the meeting. India has “worked very hard not to be boxed into one side or the other,” Markey said. The country could not “afford to alienate Russia or the US and Modi doesn’t want discussion of the war to force any difficult decisions or to distract from other issues, like green, sustainable economic development,” he added. But with plummeting ties between Washington and Beijing after the US military shot down what it says was a Chinese spy balloon that flew over American territory, New Delhi will have to carefully drive difficult negotiations between conflicting viewpoints. China maintains the balloon, which US forces downed in February, was a civilian research aircraft accidentally blown off course, and the fallout led Blinken to postpone a planned visit to Beijing. As differences played out during the ministerial meeting Thursday, analysts say while India will be disappointed at the outcome, they were in a very difficult position to begin with. “It will be a disappointment for Modi, but not one that cannot be managed,” Markey said. “Nor would it be India’s fault, as it would primarily be a reflection of the underlying differences over which Modi has very little control.” ",1392,india,2023-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/india/india-g20-foreign-ministers-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html

      South Korean diplomats dance into Indian hearts in ‘Naatu Naatu’ viral video
    ","Dancing South Korean diplomats have won the hearts of millions of Indians with their viral video performance of Oscar-nominated song “Naatu Naatu,” reinforcing Seoul’s soft power diplomacy and even earning a nod of approval from India’s leader. In a video clip posted to Twitter on Sunday, staff from South Korea’s embassy in India’s capital New Delhi – many wearing traditional clothing from both countries – dance to the popular song from Telugu-language movie “RRR.” The 53-second clip, which features South Korean Ambassador Chang Jae-bok, has gone viral on social media, garnering more than 4 million views on Twitter as of Tuesday – and much praise in India. “Lively and adorable team effort,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Love you for this!” author Kulpreet Yadav wrote, while another fan of the clip, Bhargav Mitra, called it “an excellent initiative.” “A fitting tribute to bilateral relations. How well can a song & dance sequence unite,” he wrote on Twitter. India’s positive response to the video reflects the growing popularity of South Korean culture in the country, where millions have embraced K-pop and K-dramas in recent years. Indians are also making inroads in South Korea’s entertainment industry. Singer Shreya Lenka became India’s first homegrown K-pop star when she joined girl group Blackswan last year, while Indian actor Anupam Tripathy starred in award-winning South Korean Netflix show, “Squid Game.” “Naatu Naatu,” which translates to “dance dance,” is composed by M.M. Keeravani, with lyrics from Chandrabose. Praised for its buoyant choreography and catchy tune, “Naatu Naatu” won India’s first ever Golden Globe in the best original song category last month and is favorite to win best original song at the 95th Academy Awards on March 12. The original song features Telugu superstars Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr., known as Jr NTR, who dance in perfect synchronization to the lyrics. The video has more than 122 million views on YouTube. The Indian film industry produces tens of thousands of movies every year in multiple languages, and “RRR,” which stands for Rise Roar Revolt, is the country’s fourth-highest grossing picture, according to IMDb, earning nearly $155 million worldwide. It is set during India’s struggle for independence from British colonial rule and became Netflix’s most watched non-English movie last June.

      India’s opposition vows to keep ‘raising questions about Adani group’ after spokesperson arrested
    ","When dozens of security personnel crowded onto the runway of New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi Airport on Thursday, it was not to capture a terrorist or fleeing criminal mastermind, or even to apprehend an unruly passenger. It was to arrest an opposition politician who had allegedly “disturbed harmony” — by misstating the Prime Minister’s middle name. Pawan Khera, the spokesperson for the Congress party, had been on his way to his party’s national convention when he was forced off his plane and arrested by police. His alleged crime? Disturbing communal harmony by making a jibe at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he had referred to on live TV last week as “Narendra Gautamdas Modi” in reference to embattled business magnate Gautam Adani. Adani, seen as a close ally of Modi and one of the wealthiest people in the world, saw his net worth halved in less than two weeks last month after a report by financial research firm Hindenburg leveled allegations of stock market manipulation and fraud against the Adani Group. The Adani Group condemned the report as “baseless” and “malicious.” Police from the state of Assam said they had deployed a team to New Delhi to arrest Khera for questioning after a case was registered on Wednesday for his “objectionable remarks about the Prime Minister.” “[Khera] was trying to disturb the communal harmony in society, (according to) sections of the Indian Penal Code under criminal conspiracy,” Prasanta Kumar Bhuyan, Assam police spokesperson, told CNN. But the arrest of Khera has set the stage for a dramatic showdown between India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress party, which has accused the government of stiffling dissent in the world’s largest democracy of 1.3 billion people. Scores of Congress politicians responded to the arrest by sitting on the airstrip in protest. Khera was released hours later, after India’s Supreme Court ordered him to be released on interim bail. But his brief detention set off a media frenzy in the country, dominating prime time news and headlines. Speaking to reporters after his release on Thursday, Khera said he was “asked to deplane as if I was a terrorist.” “This is not the only example of people’s rights and liberties being curtailed. Today it’s me, tomorrow it could be anyone,” he said. Congress member Supriya Shrinate, who was traveling with Khera at the time of his arrest, added, “If this isn’t tyranny, then what is?” The Congress party said in a statement that Khera’s arrest was “undemocratic,” and “arbitrary,” adding: “We vehemently oppose this dictatorial behavior.” “This charade is not going to deter us from raising questions” about the Adani group and its alleged ties to Modi, it said. CNN has contacted a BJP national spokesperson for a comment but has not yet had a response. Speaking to Indian news channel NDTV late Thursday, the BJP chief minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, said: “Police have all the rights to arrest (Khera). Khera’s arrest comes weeks after the country banned a documentary from the BBC that was critical of the Prime Minister’s alleged role in deadly riots more than 20 years ago. Indian tax authorities raided the BBC’s offices in New Delhi and Mumbai earlier this month citing “irregularities and discrepancies” in the BBC’s taxes. The BBC defended its documentary and said it was complying with the tax investigation. Days before Khera’s arrest, Sarma, the Assam chief minister, had warned there would be consequences to his remarks about Modi. “India will not forget or forgive these horrible remarks of Congressmen,” he wrote on Twitter on Monday. CNN has not yet been able to reach Khera and his lawyers. ",606,india,2023-02-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/24/india/modi-comment-opposition-politician-arrest-reactions-intl-hnk/index.html

      At least 35 killed after falling into underground stepwell in Indian temple
    ","At least 35 people were killed Thursday after falling into a stepwell at a Hindu temple in central India after its floor covering collapsed, according to local officials. The incident happened at the Shri Beleshwar Mahadev Jhulelal Temple in the city of Indore, in Madhya Pradesh state. The stepwell’s covering had collapsed “due to the heavy load” on top, according to the state’s chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra initially said Thursday that 19 people had been rescued from the stepwell, though two later died. Water was being pumped out of the stepwell to help rescue efforts, he added. Stepwells are large wells or reservoirs with steps that descend to the water level. Later that evening, senior district official Ilayaraja T told reporters they had recovered 35 bodies, with one person still missing and 16 injured. “There is a lot of silt. Once we do the de-silting, we will do another round of searches,” he said. The army, as well as federal and state disaster response teams, are involved in the rescue. “Despite all efforts, we could not save many lives,” said Chouhan, adding that he had ordered an investigation into the incident. Videos and images of the rescue operation show a large, gaping hole in the ground under the temple, with people climbing up a ladder to the surface and authorities feeding ropes down. A metal wiring structure can be seen hanging off the edge, appearing to have given way; outside, anxious crowds gathered outside the temple, with authorities carrying out the injured on stretchers. Thursday was Rama Navami, a Hindu festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ram, often marked by devotees visiting temples and performing religious chants or songs. Photos from the Indore temple show items scattered on the floor near the hole, including candles, offerings and sweets. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to the victims and their families on Thursday, tweeting that he was “extremely pained” by the incident. “The State Government is spearheading rescue and relief work at a quick pace,” he said. The injured and families of the dead will receive compensation from the government, Chouhan said.

      India’s parliament strips Rahul Gandhi of lawmaker status after defamation conviction
    ","The former leader of India’s main opposition political party has been disqualified as a lawmaker, a day after he was handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation, in a ruling his supporters say is politically motivated. India’s lower house, the Lok Sabha, said in a statement that Rahul Gandhi “stands disqualified from the membership,” citing his recent conviction. It is the second setback in as many days for India’s opposition Congress party and could neuter one of the few figures that has the kind of star power and name recognition to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Thursday, Gandhi was found guilty of defamation by a court in western state of Gujarat for a speech he made in 2019, in which he referred to thieves as having the same surname as Modi. The 52-year-old politician was granted bail, according to his Congress party, which decried his conviction, accusing Modi of using the courts to silence his critics. “Everyone knows that Rahul Gandhi… is raising his voice against the dictator. He’s showing the courage to call out what is wrong,” the party said in a statement on Thursday. The conviction opened up an opportunity for his opponents, particularly within Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Under Indian law, a member of parliament can be disqualified for offenses such as “promoting enmity between two groups, bribery and undue influence or personation at an election.” If a lawmaker is convicted for any other offense and sentenced to a period of two years or more, they can also be disqualified. “He (Gandhi) stands convicted and as per law conviction leads to automatic disqualification. The Congress knows this,” BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya told CNN affiliate News18. Following his disqualification Gandhi will be unable to contest future elections unless his sentence is either stayed or he is acquitted. “We will fight this battle both legally and politically. We will not be intimidated or silenced,” senior Congress politician Jairam Ramesh tweeted. Indian parties from across the political spectrum have condemned Gandhi’s disqualification as an MP. Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state and chairperson of the All India Trinamool Congress, tweeted, “In PM Modi’s New India, opposition leaders have become the prime target of BJP! While BJP leaders with criminal antecedents are inducted into the cabinet, Opposition leaders are disqualified for their speeches. Today, we have witnessed a new low for our constitutional democracy.” MP Derek O’Brien, also of the All India Trinamool Congress, posted a video on Twitter, saying, “The BJP is desperate to silence the voice of the opposition… We know they will go to all kinds of lows but this is the low of the low… BJP, shame on you.” Manoj Jha, an MP with the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal party, wrote on Twitter that democracy had been “declared dead.” “How bizarre and obnoxious. Shamelessness has got a new address. Yet don’t say democracy is dead in India. Parties in opposition must see that it is not about ‘elections’ alone but the fight must be to resuscitate democracy…” Jha wrote in a separate tweet. Shashi Tharoor, an MP from Gandhi’s party, expressed his shock on Twitter, saying: “I’m stunned by this action and by its rapidity, within 24 hours of the court verdict and while an appeal was known to be in process. This is politics with the gloves off and it bodes ill for our democracy.” Gandhi stood against Modi to contest the country’s top seat in the 2019 general election but he lost heavily. He subsequently stepped down as Congress’ president but remains an influential figure within the party. He is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India’s first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country’s founding Prime Minister. His grandmother was assassinated while in office, and his father was killed by a bomb blast while he was campaigning in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.” They are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy. “We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies. During the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University. But when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission. Some, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary. Others have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field. While Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation. “We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said. Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests. They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation. “The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.” Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle. Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition. But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000. Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.” In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security. Under pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.” “Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added. But Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said. Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms. “We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said. ",882,middleeast,2023-04-03,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/israel-protests-military-veterans-intl-cmd/index.html

      Erdogan’s political fate may be determined by Turkey’s Kurds
    ","Turkey’s persecuted pro-Kurdish party has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival. “We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a statement on March 23. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.” It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader Selahattin Demirtas has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics. The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media. Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections. “It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.” Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, an ethnic minority from which a separatist militant movement has emerged. The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK. But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates. Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International. It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate. The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament. If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey. The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority. “They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament. The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation. “We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.” The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.” Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism. Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure. The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC. A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.” Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities. “We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.

Iran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond A second Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officer died following an attack in Syria on Friday, according to Iranian state media on Sunday. Iranian state media said the Iranian military adviser died after an Israeli attack near the Syrian capital Damascus left him wounded. The attack also killed another IRGC officer. In a tweet on Sunday, Iranian government spokesman Ali Bahadori Jahromi said the alleged Israeli attack wouldn’t go unanswered. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Sunday that Iran has the right to respond to “state terrorism.” Iranian-American comedian Maz Jobrani, who has been touring the Middle East, spoke to CNN’s Becky Anderson about his support for the protests in his homeland, saying that he used his standup comedy platform to highlight the “brutality against the Iranian people.” “It was an opportunity for me to say, ‘let’s keep fighting,’” he said. Watch the interview here. An Iranian state news outlet is gloating at what it sees as the demise of the US dollar. IRNA recreated a popular meme to mark China and Brazil’s decision to reportedly ditch the US dollar as an intermediary in trade, citing the Chinese state news outlet, China Daily.

China Daily said that the agreement was part of “the rising global use of the Chinese renminbi.” It would reportedly enable China and Brazil to conduct trade and financial transactions using local currencies instead of the dollar.

      Palestinian man shot dead in disputed circumstances near Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa compound
    ","A Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli police early on Saturday at the entrance to the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem, frequently a flashpoint in tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinian and Israeli sources disputed the circumstances that led to the killing of 26-year-old Muhammad Al-Osaibi at the compound, home to one of Islam’s most revered sites but also the holiest site in Judaism, known as the Temple Mount. A former Israeli lawmaker, Talab Al-Sanee, said Al-Osaibi was killed after he tried to intervene when he saw Israeli police and border guards assaulting a young Palestinian woman. Israeli police said the man had grabbed a gun from a police officer who had stopped him for questioning and managed to fire two shots before he was killed by police. Social media video apparently filmed at the time of the incident captured the sound of at least 11 gunshots – the first one followed almost immediately by nine in quick succession, then another one after a moment’s pause. Al-Osaibi’s family asked police to release security camera footage of the incident to prove “the allegations that their son pulled a soldier’s weapon.” Police initially said there was no footage of the incident, but after CNN provided evidence that security cameras were pointed at the scene they altered their story. “We collected all footage of the surrounding area for investigation,” a spokesperson said. “Some footage might not be shared with media because it’s still closed for investigation.” The incident came in the middle of Ramadan, which has passed largely peacefully in Jerusalem. The first two Fridays of the Muslim holy month have seen hundreds of thousands of worshippers offer prayers at al-Aqsa without incident. A large group of Muslim worshippers staged a mass prayer outside the holy site Saturday after the incident, video from the scene showed. Local authorities in Al-Osaibi’s native region of Rahat in the Negeb called for a general strike on Sunday in response to the killing. And Palestinian Authority presidency spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh warned in a statement against what he described as “the dangerous escalation by the Israeli occupation authorities,” calling the Israeli version of the killing of Al-Osaibi “fabricated.” The relative calm of Ramadan comes after a violent beginning to the year in Israel and the occupied West Bank. At least 90 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian Ministry of Health statistics. In addition to suspected militants being targeted by Israeli forces, the dead include Palestinians killing, wounding or attempting to kill Israeli civilians, people clashing with Israeli security and bystanders, CNN records show. In the same period, at least 15 Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank, CNN records show – 14 civilians and a police officer who was hit by friendly fire after being stabbed by a Palestinian teenager while inspecting bus passengers.

      Taliban detains three British men in Afghanistan, UK non-profit says
    ","Three British men have been detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to the non-profit Presidium Network. The UK non-profit which “provides support to communities in crisis” tweeted Saturday that they have been working with the families of two of the detained men “in support of finding a resolution and release for the detainees.” The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office is working to contact the detained British nationals and also supporting their families, they said in a statement. Scott Richards, co-founder of the Presidium Network, claimed the detention of the three men is “ultimately the extension of a misunderstanding.” During an interview with UK’s private Sky Network, Richards said the organization has spoken with multiple witnesses to the events and believes that the General Directorate of Intelligence, the national intelligence, security, and spy agency under the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, “reacted to a tip regarding weapons stored in the premises.” “That weapon was licensed. And we believe that during the course of the search, the license may have been separated from the weapon,” Richards added. When asked if the men were in good health, Richards said “We do believe they’re in good health and being well treated. We have no reason to believe they’ve been subjected to the sort of any negative treatment such as torture.” The arrests come amidst a clampdown on those advocating for the education of Afghan women and as allegations of war crimes committed by the British Armed Forces in Afghanistan are under investigation.

      UAE leader names his son as Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi
    ","The leader of the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday named his eldest son as crown prince of Abu Dhabi and his likely successor as president of the second biggest Arab economy. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ), president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi, named Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed as crown prince of the emirate, state-run WAM news agency reported. The move comes 10 months after MBZ became president of the Persian Gulf nation after the death of his brother Sheikh Khalifa. Oil-rich UAE is a member of the OPEC oil cartel and controls some of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds. The nation is a federation of seven emirates, each with its own ruling family, which also includes the regional business and tourism hub Dubai. MBZ also appointed his brother Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed as vice president of the UAE, a position he will share with the ruler of Dubai and Prime Minister of the UAE Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR), 73, who is also his father-in-law. The position was previously held solely by the ruler of Dubai. Sheikh Mansour, 52, has been deputy prime minister of the UAE since 2009, and this month became the chairman of Mubadala, one of the UAE’s sovereign wealth funds that manages $17 billion worth of assets. Sheikh Mansour is also the owner of the Premier League’s Manchester City Football Club. Two brothers of the president, Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed and Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed, were named deputy rulers of Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Sheikh Tahnoun is the UAE’s national security adviser and chairman of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which has assets worth $790 billion, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the naming of a second vice president for the first time indicates an attempt by Abu Dhabi to centralize power “in an inclusive way.” The appointment of Sheikh Mansoor Bin Zayed to the position alongside Dubai ruler MBR was likely intentional, she said, given that he is MBR’s son-in-law. “The overall aim of all of these appointments is to centralize without disrupting the unity and the fragmentation within the different royal families of the UAE too much,” she said. The UAE president wanted to give prominent positions in Abu Dhabi to members of his family because “having leading position in Abu Dhabi is having a leading position over the entire country,” she said. Bader Al-Saif, assistant professor of history at Kuwait University, said on Twitter that the sharing of the vice president position between Dubai and Abu Dhabi doesn’t necessarily chip away at Dubai’s role since MBR already serves as prime minister.

      Biden and Netanyahu trade barbs over plan to weaken courts as Israel rejects ‘pressure’ from White House
    ","Israel’s embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu escalated a rare public dispute with US President Joe Biden on Tuesday, rejecting “pressure” from the White House after Biden criticized his controversial efforts to weaken the Israeli judiciary. The back and forth thrust into public view a simmering diplomatic dispute that has mostly been kept private over the past several weeks. Biden and other US officials had sought to quietly dissuade Netanyahu from moving ahead with his proposed reforms without creating the appearance of a rift. But now the divide appears to be opening between the two men, who have known each other for decades. Biden said on Tuesday that he won’t invite Netanyahu to the White House “in the near term,” and issued an unusually stinging rebuke of Netanyahu’s proposed judicial overhaul after mass protests and strikes brought Israel to a standstill and delayed the legislation. “Like many strong supporters of Israel I’m very concerned. I’m concerned that they get this straight. They cannot continue down this road. I’ve sort of made that clear,” Biden told reporters in North Carolina. “Hopefully the prime minister will act in a way that he can work out some genuine compromise,” he said. “That remains to be seen.” In separate remarks on Tuesday, Biden added of Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul: “I hope he walks away from it.” Netanyahu responded with a statement late on Tuesday evening, in which he noted Biden’s “longstanding commitment to Israel,” but added: “Israel is a sovereign country which makes its decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends.” The exchange puts an unusual strain on the relationship between the leaders of the two closely allied countries. A senior Israeli official tried to play down any sense of a “crisis” in a briefing with American reporters on Wednesday, characterizing the dispute as a two on a scale of 10 and calling it a “tempest in a teapot.” Speaking on background to discuss diplomatic relations, the official said neither the Americans nor the Israelis were interested in ratcheting up the spat, and that Israel believes the Americans will issues statements calming the situation. But the official defended Israel, saying democracies should let other democracies “figure it out.” Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader and former premier, said Wednesday that Netanyahu’s efforts have “ruined” the relationship. “For decades Israel was the USA’s closest ally. The most extreme government in the country’s history ruined that in three months,” Lapid tweeted. It follows an eruption of anger inside Israel, and within some Jewish communities in the US and around the world, at the Netanyahu government’s attempts to weaken the power of the country’s courts. The prime minister finally paused the legislation on Monday after a general strike and mass protests threw Israel into chaos, but he said he planned to return to the effort in the next legislative term. Critics say Netanyahu is pushing through the changes because of his own ongoing corruption trial, which he denies. The senior Israeli official said that US pressure did not have any bearing on Netanyahu’s decision to pause the legislation, instead citing fears of pro- and anti-overhaul demonstrators facing one another in the streets. The official said that Netanyahu was serious about reaching an agreement, but drew some red lines of what was negotiable and what was not. A provision giving the government more control over the selection of judges can’t be taken out of the equation, he said. But the override clause, where the parliament will be able to overturn Supreme Court decisions, will likely not be in the final package, the official added. Israel’s President Isaac Herzog has been convening discussions among lawmakers since the controversial legislation was put on hold Tuesday. There was “good faith” during the first round of talks, the official said, but added that if negotiations don’t succeed, and Netanyahu doesn’t pass the legislation as it is currently written, he’s “telling his voters they don’t matter.” When asked why they didn’t start with negotiations, the official said Netanyahu was gagged by a court-imposed conflict of interest declaration. When asked why Justice Minister Yariv Levin didn’t engage in negotiations, the official referred the question to the Justice Minister. Netanyahu struck a defensive tone in taped remarks to the White House-hosted Summit for Democracy Wednesday morning, acknowledging “public and often painful discourse,” in his nation over the proposed reforms, while expressing hope dissent would “move from protest to agreement.” “I want to thank the world leaders and President Biden, who’s been a friend for 40 years for convening this important conference,” he said. “You know Israel and the United States have had their occasional differences, but I want to assure you that the alliance between the world’s greatest democracy, and a strong, proud, and independent democracy – Israel – in the heart of the Middle East, is unshakeable, nothing can change that.” Itamar Ben Gvir, a far-right firebrand who serves as Netanyahu’s National Security Minister, was less diplomatic in his rebuke. “Both President Biden and all the administration officials in the US should understand that Israel is an independent country, it is not another star on the US flag,” he said on Israel Army Radio Wednesday. Ahead of the summit, White House officials defended Israel’s participation despite concerns about democratic backsliding, saying they’d invited all countries who were working toward democratic ideals. Biden had so far avoided a direct criticism of Netanyahu’s efforts, with his administration instead saying on Sunday that it was watching the escalating tension with “concern.” But his comments on Tuesday marked a rare instance of the US directly weighing in on Israeli domestic affairs. It was also announced on Tuesday that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will visit Jerusalem next month, a trip that is certain to inject the likely Republican presidential contender into Israel’s national tumult and its increasingly fraught relationship with the US. “At a time of unnecessarily strained relations between Jerusalem and Washington, Florida serves as a bridge between the American and Israeli people,” DeSantis told the Jerusalem Post, which announced details of his planned keynote address at an April 27 event. The debate over Netanyahu’s proposals is likely to ratchet up again before then; while he bought himself time on Monday, he has remained determined to see through an overhaul of the judiciary that critics say diminishes Israel’s democracy.

      Netanyahu is backed into a corner. Here’s what he may do next
    ","When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his decision to delay a controversial plan to weaken the country’s judiciary on Monday, he invoked the biblical story of the Judgement of Solomon, where the king had to rule between two women, both claiming to be the mother of a child. Solomon ordered that the child be cut in two, and the woman who protested the ruling was determined to be the real mother. Before Netanyahu spoke, supporters of the judicial overhaul had gathered in the streets following calls from right-wing politicians to come out, allowing the prime minister to make his address as protesters from both sides rallied simultaneously for the first time in weeks. “Even today, both sides in the national dispute claim love for the baby – love for our country,” said Netanyahu. “I am aware of the enormous tension that is building up between the two camps, between the two parts of the people, and I am attentive to the desire of many citizens to relieve this tension.” The timing of the address was likely intentional and was meant to give Netanyahu’s much-delayed speech a favorable backdrop – two competing camps demonstrating their love for the country, said Aviv Bushinsky, a former media adviser for Netanyahu who served the prime minister for nine years. Netanyahu’s strategy has always been based on last-minute decisions, Bushinsky said, which sometimes makes it difficult to predict his next move. Other analysts say the prime minister’s strategy brings uncertainty to Israel’s future. “He is playing the game,” said Gideon Rahat, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “You can never know what will happen, and that’s the problem … There is no certainty in Israel, in the Israeli system, and I am not sure that he’s not happy about this.” Bushinsky says that if it was up to Netanyahu he would have pumped the brakes on the judicial overhaul a long time ago, as it wasn’t one of the main leadership goals declared at the start of his sixth term as prime minister. He’s standing by it because the survival of his coalition depends on it. But now, analysts say he’s backed into a corner between appeasing protesters and keeping his government intact. Before Netanyahu announced the delay, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s Jewish Power party broke the news, noting that part of the delay agreement was to establish a National Guard. That caused alarm, with some speculating on social media that Ben Gvir, who has an extremist past, was being allowed to set up his own militia. Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Tuesday that putting Ben Gvir in charge of the National Guard is “the equivalent of putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.” Ben Gvir was quick to address the concerns about the new body. “Let’s put things straight: no private army and no militias,” he said in a statement published on his Telegram page. Bushinsky downplayed the significance of the National Guard, saying it is “a comfort prize” for Ben Gvir – “a prize for the losers.” The prime minister is now faced with very few options, analysts say. If he sides with his coalition and votes on the overhaul, crippling protests and strikes would resume. If he pulls the brakes, his coalition could collapse. The only wiggle room the Israeli leader has, analysts say, is if negotiators reach a moderated judicial overhaul plan bill over the Knesset’s recess period, which ends April 30, and where concessions to his right-wing coalition members need not be too extreme. Netanyahu may also be hoping for the reform bill to be shelved for the time being. “I think Netanyahu will try to run away from this thing, hoping that things will gradually ease,” said Bushinsky, noting that the ministers who had threatened to resign should the bill not advance have all remained in their posts. Analysts say, however, that what could once again unite the fragmented country and have the public rally behind the government is a potential security threat, either from neighboring countries or through conflict with the Palestinians. A security crisis would reorient the government’s attention, said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, whether it arises from conflict with the Palestinians, the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon or others. “Some thought that if there was a security crisis, then Netanyahu would be saved by the bell,” said Bushinsky. Palestinians are watching the process with unease amid fears that they will pay the price of Netanyahu’s concessions to right-wing coalition members with a history of anti-Palestinian rhetoric. “We are seeing that Palestinians are once again paying the price for Israel’s electoral choices,” said Buttu. “There may be calm in the streets of Tel Aviv … but for Palestinians, the reality remains the same.” How Netanyahu will act remains uncertain, and not everyone is optimistic that the recess period will yield any kind of consensus or moderation in his position. “I have not detected any indication that tells me that the prime minister is actually entering into the negotiations with a keen interest in achieving consensus … including comprises on core aspects of the judicial overhaul,” said Plesner. Plesner notes, however, that Netanyahu and his Likud party emerged “politically injured” from the last few months, losing not only legitimacy and support in the eyes of the Israeli people, but also in the eyes of his own Likud voters. “(It was) a dramatic erosion of their political power and political posture,” he said. Biden, Netanyahu trade barbs over plan to weaken courts; Israel rejects US ‘pressure’ Israel’s embattled prime minister escalated a rare public dispute with US President Joe Biden on Tuesday, rejecting “pressure” from the White House after Biden criticized Netanyahu’s  efforts to weaken Israel’s judiciary.

The series, “London Class,” is produced by the Saudi state-backed media conglomerate MBC group and depicts Iraqi women working as maids for Kuwaiti women and being accused of theft. The show follows a group of Arab medicine students at a London university in the 1980s. Much of the anger from Iraqis is directed at Kuwait. The Kuwaiti Ministry of Information has however said the show has nothing to do with the country and was not shown on any platform there, according to Arabic media. One Baghdad-based Twitter user condemned what he said was a repeated “stream of hatred and malice from Kuwaiti shows towards our people.” The show was written by Kuwaiti writer Heba Hamada and directed by Egyptian Mohamed Bakir. Hamada responded to the criticism in an Instagram post, saying: “Iraq is the mother of civilization, and all Arabs lean on its shoulder.” Mustafa Jabbar Sanad, a member of parliament in Iraq, accused the show of “erasing the value of well-known Iraqi talents … to distort the image of the Iraqi people as a whole, not just women.” Hamada was the subject of criticism in 2019 because of a similar show she wrote called “Cairo Class,” which caused strife between Kuwaitis and Egyptians due its portrayal of Egypt. That show is being aired on Netflix. The question of honor, particularly that of Iraqi women, has long been a sensitive issue in Kuwaiti-Iraqi relations. Former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had accused Kuwait of insulting his country’s women, citing it as a reason for his invasion of the country  in 1990. In a 2004 court hearing in Iraq, the former president decried being held accountable for the invasion. “How could Saddam be tried over Kuwait that said it will reduce Iraqi women to 10-dinar prostitutes?” he asked, referring to himself. “He (Hussein) defended Iraq’s honor and revived its historical rights over those dogs,” Saddam said, referring to the Kuwaitis. Iraq made its final reparation payment for that invasion last year, having paid the Gulf nation a total of $52.4 billion.

      ‘Historic’ strikes leave Israel at standstill with crowds in streets to protest judicial reform
    ","Israel’s political crisis escalated into uncharted territory Monday as the country’s largest trade union announced a “historic” strike shutting down transportation, universities, restaurants and retailers in protest against Prime Minister’s Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned judicial overhaul. Israel’s Histadrut trade union which coordinated the strike said that some government ministries, the country’s three biggest cities, banks, ports and many other companies and agencies were on strike on Monday and added that essential services such as hospitals and firefighters were to operate on a Saturday schedule. All takeoffs from Israel’s main airport, Ben Gurion Tel Aviv, were halted for several hours because of the strike. Workers at the country’s largest port in Haifa stopped working, some universities were shuttered and some of the country’s best-known retailers, including McDonald’s and the shopping mall chain Azrieli Group, announced closures. Several Israeli embassies including the ones in Washington DC, London and Paris, were closed on Monday after their workers and some diplomats joined the strike. The strikes were announced following Netanyahu’s decision on Sunday to fire his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant who became the first member of the cabinet to call for a pause in the reforms. Massive spontaneous protests took over the Israeli city of Tel Aviv late Sunday night in response to the Gallant news, with people waving Israeli flags and chanting “democracy.” Protesters lit several fires on the main highway in the city and blocked number of streets and bridges, including the Ayalon Highway. Despite reports in Israeli media that Netanyahu would speak on Monday, his only comments since he fired Gallant came in a short tweet in which he urged protesters to “behave responsibly.” “I call on all the demonstrators in Jerusalem, on the right and the left, to behave responsibly and not to act violently. We are brotherly people,” he said on Twitter. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been protesting for months against the planned judicial changes which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary. Israel’s former Prime Minister Yair Lapid urged Netanyahu to reverse the decision to fire Gallant, calling the move a “new low.” He wrote on Twitter that Netanyahu might be able to fire the minister but “cannot fire the people of Israel who are standing up to the insanity of the coalition.” In a statement issued later, Lapid called the past 24 hours “madness,” “loss of control” and “loss of direction.” “We’ve never been closer to falling apart. Our national security is at risk, our economy is crumbling, our foreign relations are at their lowest point ever, we don’t know what to say to our children about their future in this country. We have been taken hostage by a bunch of extremists with no brakes and no boundaries,” he said. Gallant argued for a halt to the judicial reforms in a speech Saturday night, when Netanyahu was out of the country on an official visit to the United Kingdom. Some military reservists have pledged to pull out of their service in opposition to the plans, which critics say would undermine the independence of the judiciary. Gallant said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security. His ouster and the mass protests that followed prompted a string of prominent officials to call for a halt to the judicial reform process. In a Facebook post on Monday, Israel’s President Isaac Herzog called on Netanyahu and his government to immediately pause the plans. “Deep concern hovers over the entire nation. Security, economy, society – everyone is threatened,” Herzog said in the statement. “The eyes of all the people of Israel are on you. The eyes of all the Jewish people are on you. The eyes of the whole world are on you. For the sake of the unity of Israelis, for the sake of committed responsibility I call on you to halt the legislative procedure immediately.” Separately, more than two dozen mayors from across Israel declared hunger strike over judicial overhaul on Monday. Moshe Fadlon, the mayor of the coastal city of Herzliya, posted a statement saying: “Starting tomorrow morning, [we] are launching a hunger strike in Jerusalem opposite the prime minister’s office, demanding an end to the huge crisis and the disaster that Israel is hurtling towards, to prevent the security of the country being affected and for the sake of togetherness and unity of the country.” The statement was signed by 27 officials, representing a broad spectrum of local authorities across the country. Amid the protests, Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from his own party. Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar and Diaspora Affairs and Social Equality Minister Amichai Chikli – all members of Netanyahu’s Likud party – also suggested that the prime minister should stop the legislation early on Monday morning. Barkat, a former mayor of Jerusalem, suggested Netanyahu should “stop and recalculate” his overhaul plan, warning it has brought the country to the brink of civil war. “The reform is necessary and we will do it – but not at the cost of a civil war,” he said. Even some of the most forceful proponents of the reform appeared to be softening their stance. Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who has strongly advocated for the reform to be pushed through, opened the door to the possibility of a delay on Monday. “I will respect any decision that Prime Minister Netanyahu makes regarding legal reform legislative procedures,” Levin, who is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, said. “This is with the knowledge that a situation in which everyone does what he feels like, may immediately lead to the fall of the government and the collapse of the Likud,” he said. In his speech on Saturday, Gallant said the pause was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest at the government plans. Gallant reiterated that sentiment in a tweet on Sunday after his dismissal: “The security of the State of Israel has always been and will always remain the mission of my life.” Under the proposals, the government would have control over the appointment of judges, and parliament would gain the power to override Supreme Court decisions. The government argues the changes are essential to rein in the Supreme Court, which they see as insular, elitist, and no longer representative of the Israeli people. Opponents say the plans threaten the foundations of Israeli democracy. Part of the plan – which effectively strips the courts of the power to declare a prime minister unfit for office – has already been pushed through. Critics say Netanyahu is pushing through the changes because of his own ongoing corruption trial; Netanyahu denies this.

      A threat to democracy or much-needed reform? Israel’s judicial overhaul explained
    ","For months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been taking to the streets across the country to protest far-reaching changes to Israel’s legal system some say threaten the country’s democratic foundations. Tensions rose further this weekend when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over his opposition to the planned overhaul, prompting mass street protests and widespread strike action. At its core, the judicial overhaul would give the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, and therefore the parties in power, more control over Israel’s judiciary. From how judges are selected, to what laws the Supreme Court can rule on, to even giving parliament power to overturn Supreme Court decisions, the changes would be the most significant shakeups to Israel’s judiciary since its founding in 1948. The proposed reforms do not come out of nowhere. Figures from across the political spectrum have in the past called for changes to Israel’s judiciary. Israel has no written constitution, only a set of quasi-constitutional basic laws, making the Supreme Court even more powerful. But Israel also has no check on the power of the Knesset other than the Supreme Court. Here’s what you need to know. The judicial overhaul is a package of bills, all of which need to pass three votes in the Knesset before they become law. One of the most important elements for the Netanyahu government is the bill that changes the makeup of the nine-member committee that selects judges, in order to give the government a majority of the seats on the committee. Netanyahu and his supporters argue that the Supreme Court has become an insular, elitist group that does not represent the Israeli people. They argue the Supreme Court has overstepped its role, getting into issues it should not rule on. Defending his plans, the prime minister has pointed to countries like the United States, where politicians control which federal judges are appointed and approved. Another significant element of the changes is known as the override clause, which would give the Israeli parliament the power to pass laws previously ruled invalid by the court, essentially overriding Supreme Court decisions. Supporters say the Supreme Court should not interfere in the will of the people, who vote the politicians into power. “We go to the polls, vote, and time after time, people we did not elect decide for us,” Justice Minister Yariv Levin said while unveiling the reforms at the beginning of January. Another bill, now voted through, makes it more difficult for a sitting Prime Minister to be declared unfit for office, restricting the reasons to physical or mental incapacity and requiring either the prime minister themselves, or two-thirds of the cabinet, to vote for such a declaration. Although several bills could affect Netanyahu it is the one about declaring a prime minister “unfit for office” that has the biggest implication for the Israeli prime minister. Critics say Netanyahu is pushing the overhaul forward because of his own ongoing corruption trial, where he faces charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing. That bill is largely seen by opposition leaders as a way to protect Netanyahu from being declared unfit for office as a result of the trial. As part of a deal with the court to serve as a prime minister despite being on trial, Netanyahu accepted a conflict of interest declaration. The Attorney General determined that the declaration meant Netanyahu could not be involved in the policy-making of the judicial overhaul. A petition is currently in front of the Israeli Supreme Court to declare Netanyahu unfit for office on the grounds he has violated that conflict of interest declaration and the attorney general has written an open letter to Netanyahu saying he is in breach of the deal and the law. Critics also argue that if the government has a greater say in which judges are appointed, Netanyahu’s allies will appoint judges they know will rule in Netanyahu’s favor. Netanyahu, it should be said, has completely denied this and has claimed his trial is “unraveling” on its own. In the past, Netanyahu has publicly expressed strong support for an independent judiciary. Asked why he’s supporting such an overhaul despite those public proclamations, Netanyahu told CNN’s Jake Tapper: “I haven’t changed my view. I think we need a strong, independent judiciary. But an independent judiciary doesn’t mean an unbridled judiciary, which is what has happened here, I mean, over the last 25 years.” Weakening the judicial branch could limit both Israelis and Palestinians in seeking the court’s defense of their rights if they believe they are compromised by the government. Palestinians in the occupied West Bank could be affected, and of course Palestinian citizens of Israel or those who hold residency cards would be directly affected. Israel’s Supreme Court has no influence on what happens in Gaza, which is ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Critics of the changes worry that if the politicians have more control, the rights of minorities in Israel, especially Palestinians living in Israel, would be impacted. Last year, for example, the court halted the evictions of Palestinian families in the flashpoint neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem, where Jewish groups have claimed ownership of land the families have lived on for decades. At the same time, Palestinian activists have argued that the high court has further entrenched Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, having never considered the legality of Israeli settlements there, even though they’re considered illegal by most of the international community. The high court has also been the subject of complaints from Israel’s far right and settlers, who say it is biased against settlers; they have condemned the court’s involvement in approving the eviction of settlers from Gaza and the Northern West Bank in 2005. The overhaul has caused concern across Israel’s financial, business, security and academic sectors. Critics say the overhaul goes too far, and will completely destroy the only avenue available to provide checks and balances to the Israeli legislative branch. They warn it will harm the independence of the Israeli judiciary, and will hurt rights not enshrined in Israel’s quasi-constitutional basic laws, like minority rights and freedom of expression. According to polling released in February by the Israel Democracy Institute, only a minority of Israelis support the reforms. The vast majority – 72% – want a compromise to be reached and, even then, 66% think the Supreme Court should have the power to strike down laws and 63% of Israelis think the current method of appointing judges should stay as it is. Members of the typically apolitical high-tech sector have also spoken out against the reforms. Assaf Rappaport, CEO of cybersecurity firm Wiz, has said the firm won’t be moving any of the $300 million capital it recently raised to Israel because of the unrest over the overhaul. Israel’s Central Bank Governor Amir Yaron told CNN’s Richard Quest that the reforms are too “hasty” and risk harming the economy. Several former Mossad chiefs have also spoken out against the reforms, warning division over the issue is harming Israeli security. Hundreds of reservists in Israel’s army have warned they will not answer the call to serve if the reforms pass, saying they believe Israel will no longer be a full democracy under the changes. Israeli President Isaac Herzog has said the government’s legislation is “misguided, brutal and undermines our democratic foundations,” and warned Israel was potentially on the brink of a “civil war.” Although the Israeli presidency is largely a ceremonial role, Herzog has been actively speaking with all parties calling for negotiations. On Monday, he urged the government immediately to halt the judicial reform process, saying “the eyes of the whole world are on you.” And on the international front, Israel’s allies, including the United States, have also expressed concern about the overhaul. According to the White House, US President Joe Biden told Netanyahu in a mid-March phone call that “democratic societies are strengthened by genuine checks and balances, and that fundamental changes should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support.” Protest organizers say they plan to intensify their demonstrations until the legislation is halted. But the government says it received a mandate from voters to pass the reform when it was elected last November. In mid-March, the coalition government softened its plans for the first time, announcing that it had amended the bill that would reform the committee that selects judges. Instead of having the vast majority of the appointed seats on the committee, the government-appointed members would have a one-seat majority. Netanyahu has vowed to keep advancing the reforms. But his decision to fire Gallant on Sunday, a day after the defense minister called for a pause in the government’s drive to overhaul the country’s judicial system, sparked turmoil. Gallant, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, was the first government minister to take a public stance in favor of a delay. The Israeli labor federation Histadrut on Monday called a “historic” general strike to heighten pressure on Netanyahu to halt his judicial overhaul. Port, airport and retail workers were among those to walk out. Meanwhile, Israel’s former Prime Minister Yair Lapid urged Netanyahu to reverse his decision to fire Gallant and told his government to halt its judicial overhaul, telling the Knesset that the country had been “taken hostage by a bunch of extremists with no brakes and no boundaries.” Netanyahu has previously called for opposition politicians to meet with him to negotiate, something they have said they will only do if the legislative process is halted. Complicating matters further, should the bills pass parliament the Supreme Court must then potentially decide on laws curbing its own power. This raises the possibility of a constitutional standoff. Would the Supreme Court strike down the laws, and if so, how would the government respond?

      Mass protests erupt in Israel after Netanyahu fires minister who opposed judicial overhaul
    ","The strikes were announced following Netanyahu’s decision on Sunday to fire his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant who became the first member of the cabinet to call for a pause in the reforms. Waving Israeli flags and chanting “democratia,” protestors could be seen blocking streets and bridges, including the Ayalon Highway. Protesters lit several fires on the main highway in Tel Aviv, their acrid, black smoke billowing into the sky, partly obscuring some of the city’s iconic skyscrapers. By around 2 a.m. local time in Tel Aviv, protests had thinned out but live pictures from the scene showed security forces firing water cannons on those still gathered. Israel’s political crisis deepened on Sunday when Netanyahu’s office announced the removal of Yoav Gallant in a one-line statement, after he became the first member of the cabinet to call for a pause to controversial plans to overhaul the country’s court system. “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to remove Defense Minister Yoav Gallant from his post,” the statement read. Gallant argued for a halt to the judicial reforms in a speech Saturday night, when Netanyahu was out of the country on an official visit to the United Kingdom. Some military reservists have pledged to pull out of their service in opposition to the plans, which critics say would undermine the independence of the judiciary. Gallant said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security. His ouster and the mass protests that followed prompted a string of prominent officials to call for a halt to the judicial reform process. In a Facebook post on Monday, Israel’s President Isaac Herzog called on Netanyahu and his government to immediately pause the plans. “Deep concern hovers over the entire nation. Security, economy, society – everyone is threatened,” Herzog said in the statement. “The eyes of all the people of Israel are on you. The eyes of all the Jewish people are on you. The eyes of the whole world are on you. For the sake of the unity of Israelis, for the sake of committed responsibility I call on you to halt the legislative procedure immediately.” Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar and Diaspora Affairs and Social Equality Minister Amichai Chikli – all members of Netanyahu’s Likud party – also suggested that the prime minister should stop the legislation early on Monday morning.

Gallant reiterated that sentiment in a tweet on Sunday after his dismissal: “The security of the State of Israel has always been and will always remain the mission of my life.” Israel’s former Prime Minister Yair Lapid called Gallant’s dismissal a “new low.” He wrote on Twitter that Netanyahu might be able to fire the minister but “cannot fire the people of Israel who are standing up to the insanity of the coalition.” He added: “The Prime Minister of Israel is a danger to the security of the State of Israel.” Israel’s Consul General in New York, Asaf Zamir, resigned in response to Netanyahu’s decision to fire Gallant. In his resignation letter, which he  posted on Twitter,  Zamir called  Netanyahu’s move  a “dangerous decision” and added that that he had “become increasingly concerned with the policies of the new government, and in particular, the judicial reform it is leading.” “I believe that this reform undermines the very foundation of our democratic system and threatens the rule of law in our country,” he wrote. Universities in Israel will go on strike starting Monday, they announced, and the country’s largest labor union and business leaders said they would hold a press conference on Monday morning. The labor union, Histadrut, said its press conference with business leaders scheduled for 11 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) would be dramatic. Under the proposals, the government would have control over the appointment of judges, and parliament would gain the power to override Supreme Court decisions. The government argues the changes are essential to rein in the Supreme Court, which they see as insular, elitist, and no longer representative of the Israeli people. Opponents say the plans threaten the foundations of Israeli democracy. The military reservists’ protest is seen as a particular worry for Israel’s government, as they are regularly called up to train and serve, even in peacetime. “Gallant was elected by the votes of right-wing voters and in practice promotes a left-wing agenda.  At the moment of truth he collapsed under the pressure of the media and the protesters. I call on the Prime Minister to fire him immediately.” Piling further pressure on Netanyahu, Israel’s High Court on Sunday gave him a week to a respond to a petition calling for him to be held in contempt of court. The legal move by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel comes after the attorney general told Netanyahu he acted illegally and violated a court-imposed conflict of interest order by saying he would personally involve himself in the judicial overhaul. Part of the plan – which effectively strips the courts of the power to declare a prime minister unfit for office – has already been pushed through. Critics say Netanyahu is pushing through the changes because of his own ongoing corruption trial; Netanyahu denies this. Netanyahu himself has given no indication he will back down. In a speech on Thursday he said he would address the concerns of “both sides,” but pledged to continue with the reform plans. Likud lawmaker Danny Danon said it was too soon to know if there were enough rebels in the party to stop the legislation, telling CNN, “We will only know Monday,” when members of the party meet in the Knesset, or parliament. Netanyahu and his allies control 64 seats in the 120-seat legislature, so in theory five Likud rebels could deprive the coalition of an absolute majority. But lawmakers can abstain or be absent, bringing down the number of votes a law needs in order to pass.

      Lebanon wakes up in two different timezones amid Daylight Saving row
    ","Already facing one of the world’s worst economic crises, the Lebanese people have a fresh challenge after waking up in two different timezones. Lebanon’s government has postponed winter clock changes, with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati announcing Daylight Saving will be introduced from midnight on April 20 rather than from midnight on March 25. But institutions from churches to media organizations have refused to follow suit, causing confusion among the population. No official explanation was given for the move although local media suggested it was introduced to coincide with Ramadan. In some cases the debate took on a sectarian nature. Politics in Lebanon is sharply sectarian, with seats in parliament allocated by religion. The decision is facing widespread revolt, with two TV channels going ahead with the clock changes in protest. MTV Lebanon and LBCI Lebanon refused to cooperate with the adjustment, instead switching to Daylight Saving Time on Saturday. Following the announcement Middle East Airlines said it would change the timings of all of its flights for one month, advancing the timings by one hour. Adding to the sense of chaos, the government is yet to say whether it has informed officials responsible for synchronizing times on mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices of the change. Some Lebanese have found the funny side. A clip circulating on social media shows a digital clock at Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport displaying two different times; on one side the clock flashes with the time of 10:05, the other side shows 9:05. At a cafe in Beirut on Saturday evening, a Reuters journalist reported overhearing one customer ask: “Will you follow the Christian or Muslim clock starting tomorrow?” ",276,middleeast,2023-03-25,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/25/middleeast/lebanon-daylight-savings-intl/index.html

      King Charles supports research into British monarchy’s slavery links
    ","Britain’s King Charles III has shown his support for research into the British monarchy’s historical ties to transatlantic slavery, the UK’s Guardian newspaper reported Thursday, after it published a document which researchers say shows evidence of a stake in a slave-trading company belonging to King William III. The document, published by the Guardian as part of an investigation into the royal family’s historical involvement in the slave trade, shows a transfer of £1,000 of shares in the slave-trading Royal African Company to William III from 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston in 1689, the newspaper reported. Colston was the company’s deputy governor. In 2020, anti-racism protesters famously toppled a statue of the slave trader in Bristol, southwest England, while demonstrating in solidarity with the US Black Lives Matter movement. The document reported by the Guardian was found in archives by Dr Brooke Newman, a historian at Virginia Commonwealth University, on a research trip to London in January, according to the newspaper. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace told the Guardian that this was a subject that the King “takes profoundly seriously.” The statement added that the royal household would support the project by offering access to the royal collection and the royal archives, the Guardian reported. Though the palace has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the document, a spokesperson told the Guardian in a statement that King Charles supported a research project undertaken by historian Camilla de Koning at Manchester University, and co-sponsored by Historical Royal Palaces (HRP), which manages several of royal sites, looking into the monarchy’s links to the slave trade. “This is an issue that His Majesty takes profoundly seriously,” the spokesperson said to the Guardian, pointing to comments made by the King at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda last summer. “I want to acknowledge that the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history,” he said in June. “I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery’s enduring impact.” ",350,uk,2023-04-06,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/06/uk/king-charles-monarchy-slavery-links-study-intl-scli-gbr/index.html

      Husband of former Scottish first minister arrested over party finances investigation
    ","The husband of former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Peter Murrell, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with an investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National Party. Murrell, 58, stepped down as the SNP’s chief executive last month after more than two decades in the role following Sturgeon’s shock resignation as first minister in February. A 58-year-old man was “arrested as a suspect” and is being questioned by detectives, Police Scotland said in a statement. “Officers are also carrying out searches at a number of addresses as part of the investigation,” the statement added. He was later released without charge “pending further investigation,” according to Police Scotland, after spending nearly 12 hours in custody. Police Scotland has been investigating the SNP’s handling of money that was slated for Scottish independence campaigning, according to PA Media. A spokesperson for the SNP said the party would not comment on a live investigation, but it “has been cooperating fully with this investigation and will continue to do so.” The party’s governing body has agreed to a review of governance and transparency, the spokesperson added. The SNP has led the Scottish government since 2007, but momentum behind its goal of breaking away from the UK has slowed recently as the party’s polling has dipped and political headaches have mounted. Murrell and Sturgeon have been key figures in the Scottish independence movement for years. Sturgeon served as the country’s first minister for eight years, but dramatically announced that she would resign from her post on February 15. At the time, Sturgeon said she knew the “time is now” for her to stand down, adding that the move was “right for me, for my party and for the country.” Her announcement sparked a leadership battle which was won by Humza Yousaf, a race which exposed divisions within the party.

      ‘Queen Camilla’ used officially for the first time on King Charles’ coronation invitation
    ","Buckingham Palace released King Charles’ coronation invitation on Tuesday, in which his wife was titled Queen Camilla for the first time. The intricate invitation, which is printed on recycled card and includes an illustrated border of wild flowers and the Green Man from British folklore, was headed with the text: “The coronation of their majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla.” Camilla took on the title of Queen Consort following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband’s accession to the throne. “It made sense to refer to Her Majesty as the Queen Consort in the early months of His Majesty’s reign, to distinguish from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,” a royal source told CNN. “‘Queen Camilla’ is the appropriate title to set against ‘King Charles’ on the invitation. The coronation is an appropriate time to start using ‘Queen Camilla’ in an official capacity,” the source added. “All former Queen Consorts have been known as ‘Queen’ plus their first name.” The invitation will be sent to “2,000 guests who will form the congregation in Westminster Abbey” for the service on May 6,  according to a press release from the palace. Prince George, Charles’ grandson and heir to the throne, will be one of eight boys chosen to “attend Their Majesties during the Coronation Service,” the release wrote. The group includes three of Camilla’s grandchildren, according to the release. A new portrait of the couple was also released by the palace on Tuesday, taken last month in Buckingham Palace by British photographer Hugo Burnand, who took their wedding photos in 2005. Camilla’s title change on the invitation marks her long journey through the court of public opinion. Since she and Charles married, Camilla has worked hard as a senior royal, standing by Charles’ side and championing charities helping women and children. But many people find it hard to forget, or forgive, their long-running affair and the pain it caused Charles’ first wife, the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Speculation has mounted over the years what title she would take when Charles took the throne. In 2005, Clarence House issued a statement saying that she would be known as “Princess Consort” when Charles took the throne. Some in the palace at the time felt the public wasn’t ready for Camilla to take the title of queen that had been destined for Diana. But attitudes towards Camilla have softened over the years. In 2015, a CNN poll found that one in four Britons had grown to like her more and fewer people opposed her becoming known as queen. Then, in February 2022, the late Queen Elizabeth used the landmark milestone of her Platinum Jubilee to give her blessing, saying that when Charles acceded the throne, the Duchess of Cornwall will be known “as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.” The coronation will see three days of celebrations across the country in which the public will be invited to participate. The White House confirmed on Tuesday that US President Joe Biden will be skipping the coronation. According to a White House readout of a call between Biden and King Charles, the President said First Lady Jill Biden will attend the coronation on behalf of the US and congratulated Charles on the upcoming event. Biden also “conveyed his desire to meet with the King in the United Kingdom at a future date,” according to the readout. US officials have noted that Biden is following precedent as no previous US president has attended a British monarch’s coronation.

      UK raises terror threat level in Northern Ireland days before possible Biden visit
    ","The terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland has been raised from “substantial” to “severe” just days before a potential visit to the country by US President Joe Biden, but the White House has said the change won’t alter his plans. The decision to raise the threat level to “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely, was made by the UK’s MI5 security service and announced by UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris Heaton-Harris on Tuesday. Heaton-Harris said the move was made after an increase in “activity relating to Northern Ireland-related terrorism” including the attempted murder of a high-profile police officer last month. While the public should remain vigilant, they should not be alarmed, he said. Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell was shot several times by masked men in front of his son and other children at sports complex in Omagh, County Tyrone, in late February. The Police Service of Northern Ireland’s (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said at the time that the force’s primary focus was on “violent dissident republicans,” and a number of people have been arrested since the attack. “The political future of Northern Ireland rests with the democratic will of the people and not the violent actions of the few. Together we will ensure there is no return to the violence of the past,” Heaton-Harris said Tuesday. Biden confirmed earlier this month he would visit Northern Ireland for the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement (GFA), also known as the Belfast Agreement, which brought an end decades of sectarian violence between Irish republicans and unionists known as “The Troubles.” He also said he would visit the Republic of Ireland. While precise dates for Biden’s trip haven’t been finalized, the White House downplayed the terror threat change and said it would not prevent the president from visiting. “No, it does not have any potential implications for future travel,” deputy White House press secretary Olivia Dalton told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. “I think as some of you may be aware, according to the UK authorities this announcement returned Northern Ireland to the threat levels they have been at for the last 12 years, reversing a downgrade that occurred just last year.” The GFA anniversary falls on April 10, though Biden is likely to visit slightly later in the month. The 1998 deal was brokered with the assistance of then-President Bill Clinton, who will also visit Northern Ireland to mark the occasion. Biden, who is of Irish descent, has repeatedly made clear that peace on the island of Ireland is important to him. He made these comments in the context of Brexit, which many warned would lead to renewed tensions in Northern Ireland. Tensions have long existed between unionist communities, who support Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom, and republicans, who would prefer Northern Ireland to unite with the Republic of Ireland. The GFA brought these communities together in a compromise that largely ended The Troubles. A key part of the agreement is that the country’s power-sharing government must be comprised of politicians from both communities. However, the Northern Irish government has not sat since October of last year for various reasons, including the fallout from the Brexit trade deal that was agreed when the UK left the European Union. The Democratic Unionist Party, the largest unionist party, doesn’t like the status that the UK government’s Brexit deal has imposed on them. It was agreed by both the UK and the EU during Brexit negotiations that there should be no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. While it’s not explicitly outlined in the GFA that there should be no border, it is considered essential to preventing violence flaring up. That created a problem as the UK left the EU’s regulatory system. It was therefore agreed that for the purposes of keeping an open border, Northern Ireland would remain within the EU’s regulatory sphere for goods and that goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would be checked at a sea border. This, the DUP claims, puts at peril its place within the UK and forces Northern Ireland closer to the Republic of Ireland. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has since negotiated a new deal for Northern Ireland, but this is still considered unacceptable by the DUP. The fact that the Northern Irish government will not be sitting during a potential Biden visit to mark the anniversary of an agreement that has saved lives and downgraded some previously active terror groups to little more than petty crime gangs is a major disappointment to the UK government. But Sunak and the EU are both adamant that the deal will not be renegotiated and continue to urge the DUP to support the deal and restore the power-sharing government.

      Humza Yousaf wins race to replace Sturgeon as Scotland’s next leader
    ","Humza Yousaf has won the Scottish National Party leadership contest and is set to become Scotland’s First Minister replacing Nicola Sturgeon, it was announced Monday. “I will be a First Minister for all of Scotland. I will work every minute of every day to earn and to re-earn your respect and your trust,” Yousaf said in his acceptance speech. Yousaf won 52% of the final votes cast, running on a platform dedicated to delivering Scottish independence, combating the cost-of-living crisis, rejoining the European Union, banning conversion practices, and transitioning to renewable energy, amongst other campaign promises. “My immediate priority will be to continue to protect every Scot as far as we possibly can from the harm inflicted by the cost-of-living crisis, to recover and reform our NHS and other vital public services, [and] to support our wellbeing economy to improve the life chances of people right across this country,” he said. Yousaf, who has served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow Pollok since 2016 and for Glasgow between 2011 and 2016, is the first Muslim and non-white cabinet minister to have served in the Scottish Government. “To serve my country as First Minister will be the greatest privilege and honor of my life,” Yousaf added. Yousaf’s victory was confirmed at Edinburgh’s Murrayfield rugby ground on Monday afternoon after a six-week campaign where the three candidates spent much of the contest criticizing each other’s record in a series of personal attacks, Reuters reports. Yousaf takes over a party with an overriding objective to end Scotland’s three-centuries-long union with England. But while about four in 10 Scots still support independence, according to a poll this month, the departure of Sturgeon – a charismatic and commanding leader – may slow some of the momentum behind a break-up of the United Kingdom. There is no agreed strategy for how to force a new referendum – one of the reasons Sturgeon resigned. The often bad-tempered leadership contest has relieved some pressure on British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is dealing with divisions in his own party, waves of industrial action and high levels of inflation. Yousaf pointed to his own background – born in Glasgow, with a father from Pakistan and mother from Kenya – and views as examples of the inclusive, socially liberal and multi-ethnic Scotland that the SNP has promoted. Yousaf also said during the campaign an independent Scotland should look at ditching the British monarchy. Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in 2014. Britain’s vote to leave the EU two years later when a majority of Scots wanted to stay, and Scotland’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, brought new support for independence. However, an opinion poll this month showed the backing for independence dropped to 39%, or 46% when “don’t knows” are excluded. That compares with a record 58% in 2020. Michael Russell, the president of the SNP, said a week ago the party was in a “tremendous mess.” The Scottish government’s first and only Muslim cabinet minister, Yousaf will be sworn in as Scotland’s leader on Wednesday if he wins a vote in the country’s parliament the day before.

      Prince Harry back in London for high court battle with Daily Mail publisher
    ","Britain’s Prince Harry arrived at London’s High Court on Monday to attend a hearing in his claim against Associated Newspapers Limited over allegations of unlawful information gathering. The Duke of Sussex last year joined a group of high-profile figures, including singer Elton John, in legal action against the publisher of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and the Mail Online. The lawsuit accuses Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) of engaging in various means of criminal activity to obtain information on high-profile figures over the years. Elizabeth Hurley, Sadie Frost, David Furnish and Doreen Lawrence make up the rest of the plaintiffs behind the legal action. They claim they were “victims of abhorrent criminal activity and gross breaches of privacy,” according to a statement from their representatives at the time. The group has accused ANL of hiring private investigators to carry out unlawful acts such as planting listening devices in homes and cars and recording private calls. It also claims the publisher would pay corrupt police officials to obtain inside information, engaged in impersonation and deception to obtain medical records, and would hack into bank accounts and financial transactions by “illicit means and manipulation.” When the lawsuit was brought in October, the publisher rejected the allegations as “preposterous smears” and labeled the suit a “pre-planned and orchestrated attempt to drag the Mail titles into the phone-hacking scandal,” according to Britain’s PA Media news agency. An ANL spokesperson said at the time that the claims were “unsubstantiated and highly defamatory claims, based on no credible evidence,” PA reported. Monday was the start of a four-day preliminary hearing at London’s Royal Courts of Justice, during which ANL is trying to have the case thrown out. Elton John, Furnish’s husband, also made an appearance as court proceedings got underway. Prince Harry was seen sitting “towards the back of the courtroom and occasionally taking notes in a small black notebook,” PA reported. David Sherborne, a lawyer for the claimants, outlined the allegations against ANL, including illegally entering private property, unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages, listening to live calls and obtaining medical records, the news agency said. “The claimants each claim that in different ways they were the victim of numerous unlawful acts carried out by the defendant, or by those acting on the instructions of its newspapers, The Daily Mail and The Mail On Sunday. They range through a period from 1993 to 2011, even continuing beyond until 2018,” he wrote in submissions to the court. ANL’s lawyers argued in their own written submissions that the lawsuit was brought too late and should be dismissed without trial, according to PA. One of ANL’s barristers, Adrian Beltrami, said in the submissions that each claimant needs to demonstrate that they did not know, or could not have discovered earlier, that they might have been able to bring a claim against ANL for alleged misuse of their private information. “The claimants have failed to show that they have a real prospect of discharging their burden at trial and the court should not hesitate to dismiss these stale claims at an early stage, thereby avoiding what would otherwise be a considerable waste of time, costs and the court’s resources,” PA quoted Beltrami as saying. The case against ANL is one of several lawsuits launched by Prince Harry in recent years. He is also suing ANL after its Mail on Sunday newspaper published a story about his separate legal proceedings against the UK’s Home Office over his family’s security arrangements when visiting Britain. Meanwhile, he also sued the owners of UK tabloid newspapers the Sun and the Daily Mirror in 2019 over alleged historical phone hacking. The case against the publisher of the Daily Mirror is due to go to trial in May. The 38-year-old royal’s surprise appearance in London on Monday is thought to be his first trip back to the United Kingdom since he and his wife, Meghan, attended the funeral of the late Queen Elizabeth II in September. In the months since, the Sussexes have released a Netflix docu-series and the duke’s memoir, which have provided further insight into his fractured relationship with the rest of the royal family. Harry is not expected to see his brother, the Prince of Wales, a royal source told CNN. As it is the school vacation, Prince William is not in Windsor, the source added.

      Man charged with attempted murder after two fire attacks near mosques in England
    ","A man has been charged with attempting to murder two elderly men who were set on fire after they had left mosques in the English cities of London and Birmingham. Mohammed Abbkr, 28, is alleged to have sprayed a substance on the men before setting it alight in separate incidents in Ealing, west London, on February 27, and in Birmingham on Monday, West Midlands Police said. Abbkr, from Edgbaston in Birmingham, central England, appeared in court on Thursday morning, West Midlands police said in a statement. He gave no indication of a plea to either charge, PA Media reported, and he was remanded in custody. The man who was attacked in Birmingham on Monday was taken to hospital with serious injuries, which are not thought to be life-threatening. “It’s believed the man, who was walking home from Dudley Road mosque, was approached by a man who spoke to him briefly before spraying him with an unknown substance and then his jacket was set alight, causing burns to his face,” West Midlands police said. Locals in the area are being asked by police to hand over CCTV, doorbell footage or other video that could help the investigation. Last month, an 82-year-old man suffered severe burns to his face and arms after he was attacked near an Islamic center in Ealing.

      Nigerian senator guilty of organ harvesting plot, UK court rules
    ","A Nigerian senator was found guilty of plotting to harvest organs on Thursday, at the UK’s Old Bailey Court, the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement. Senator Ike Ekweremadu, his wife Beatrice and Dr. Obinna Obeta were found guilty of trafficking a 21-year-old street trader to the UK to provide a kidney for the Ekweremadus’ daughter, according to the statement. The Crown Prosecution Service reported that the victim was brought to the UK after being offered money and the promise of work in the UK, but that he did not know that he was expected to provide a kidney in return. After medical professionals became suspicious about the circumstances surrounding the donation and called it off, the victim was left to sleep on the streets for three days before approaching authorities at Staines Police Station on May 5, 2022. “This was a horrific plot to exploit a vulnerable victim by trafficking him to the UK for the purpose of transplanting his kidney,” said Joanne Jakymec, Chief Crown Prosecutor. “The convicted defendants showed utter disregard for the victim’s welfare, health and well-being and used their considerable influence to a high degree of control throughout, with the victim having limited understanding of what was really going on here.” Detective Inspector Esther Richardson from the Met’s Modern Slavery and Exploitation Command, said: “This is a landmark conviction and we commend the victim for his bravery in speaking against these offenders.” ",238,uk,2023-03-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/uk/nigerian-senator-organ-harvesting-intl-gbr/index.html

      Boris Johnson’s ‘Partygate’ interrogation is over, but he’s still in serious political trouble
    ","One of Boris Johnson’s most uncomfortable afternoons as a politician is over. The former British prime minister faced over three hours of grilling before a parliamentary committee that is investigating whether or not he knowingly misled Parliament regarding breaches of Covid-19 guidance and rules inside 10 Downing Street when he led the country. The question being asked was not if he misled Parliament: we know that he did and he accepts so. The question is not if rules were broken: we know that they were, after more than 100 fines were issued by the police to individuals working in Downing Street for attending gatherings that violated regulations. And we know that after a detailed report by a senior civil servant, Johnson has accepted full responsibility for what went wrong on his watch. He told the committee: “I was not trying to cover up or conceal anything. I said what I said in good faith based on what I honestly knew and reasonably believed,” he said, admitting that “did not mean that I believed that social distancing was complied with perfectly.” Lawmakers on the committee rebuffed Johnson’s innocence by putting it to him that it “must have been obvious to you at the time, and even more obvious on reflection afterwards as this whole thing broke around you, that it was in breach of workplace guidance,” as Conservative Bernard Jenkin put it. What is in question is whether or not Johnson knew at the time he was making a false statement to Parliament when he said in December 2021 that guidance and rules had been followed “at all times.” In his opening remarks to the committee on Wednesday, Johnson asked members to remember that this statement was made before the police investigation or civil service report into the “Partygate” scandal had been published. His suggestion, it seemed, was that hindsight is a wonderful thing, so it was only after these investigations that it became clear Johnson’s statement was incorrect. The central point of Johnson’s defense is three-pronged. First, he said it is “illogical” he could have known at the time that rules or guidance were broken because much of the photographic evidence the committee had published was taken by the Downing Street official photographer. Why, Johnson asked, would he ask a photographer to document events that he thought were illegal? Second, Johnson presented a detailed understanding of the guidance. In response to the same photographs, which show Johnson giving a speech at a gathering where social distancing is clearly not being observed, the ex-PM makes a technical argument. He said that the guidance acknowledged that social distancing was not always possible. The guidance, as Johnson put it, “was followed to the best of our ability, given the circumstances … we could not have an electrified forcefield around every individual.” In other words, the guidance allows for the guidance to not be followed to the letter. Finally, Johnson said that his advisers had told him at the time that he would be correct to say that guidance was followed at the time. Multiple advisers have denied ever giving him such assurances. Johnson’s evidence was met with a frosty reception from the members of the committee – even those from his own Conservative party. He was admonished for his rambling answers and as the hearing went on was ridiculed for the perceived logical inconsistencies in his defence. At one point, a senior Conservative lawmaker even joked at the irony of Johnson relying on evidence in a report that he had previously criticized as partisan. The heated exchanges between Johnson and the committee members are important, because it is these seven MPs – four of whom are Conservatives – that will decide if Johnson knowingly misled Parliament and what punishment he should receive. At the soft end of the scale, a humiliating apology could suffice. At the other, he could be forced to face a recall election that he could easily lose. It’s worth noting that some of the harshest questioning came from Conservative MPs. That could be because they want to be seen as impartial in a cross-party committee, but it could also be because so many Conservatives are furious with Johnson for dragging the party’s poll ratings down and destroying trust in Conservative governance. Even if Johnson’s political career is over, he is still capable of causing divisions in the United Kingdom’s ruling party. People in the committee room laughed at the absurdity of what was happening – a photo of Johnson being presented with a birthday cake and confirming his interior designer was present at the event, to give one example of many. But some of Johnson’s most loyal supporters were also present, seething at the questioning and glaring furiously at those seemingly enjoying watching the former leader squirm. The longer this went on, the angrier he seemed at being treated like a punch bag. Johnson’s job on Wednesday was to provide sufficient doubt that he lied in Parliament. He needed to provide a plausible account that when he told Parliament no rules or guidance was broken, he sincerely believed that to be the case and it is only subsequent evidence that has made him realize he was wrong. Pointedly, Johnson told the committee: “I apologize for inadvertently misleading this house but to say that I did it recklessly or deliberately is completely untrue, as the evidence shows. Whatever we got wrong, I believe that officials in number 10 and the cabinet office and indeed all of the Whitehall departments should be immensely proud of their efforts to protect this country from a loathsome disease.” How much all this matters in the broader context of the Partygate scandal, trust in politics and Johnson’s integrity is another question entirely. Poll after poll shows that the public believes Johnson broke Covid rules. Even members of his own party, according to polling published by the most influential Conservative publication, Conservative Home, says most believe he broke the rules and should not return as PM. Beyond what this loss in popularity means for Johnson personally, it is worth remembering why this scandal resonated so much with people. Many Brits sincerely believe that while they were locked up at home, doing their best to stop the spread of a deadly disease and being unable to say goodbye to relatives who died, Johnson and his Downing Street team were partying as though they were above the rules. No one’s skin is thick enough to brush that off. The evidence against Johnson is undeniably greater than the evidence in his defense. But the question being asked of the committee is both extremely narrow and specific, but also opaque. And it is, to some extent, impossible to answer with full confidence by anyone other than Johnson himself. Which brings us back to what Wednesday’s hearing was really about. During his opening statement, Johnson said that he wanted all of the evidence out in the open so that, “Parliament and public can decide for themselves.” This is what it really boiled down to: whether or not the committee and wider public believe Johnson is an honest and trustworthy person or whether he is lying to spare his reputation further damage. In the eyes of the vast majority of the British public, that question has already been answered.

      Boris Johnson endured a high-stakes ‘Partygate’ grilling that could end his political career
    ","Boris Johnson admitted he misled lawmakers but claimed he did so unintentionally, as the former British prime minister fought to save his political career at a tense and combative hearing into the “Partygate” scandal that contributed to the collapse of his government. Johnson, flanked by lawyers in a packed committee room, sparred with lawmakers during a heated three-hour grilling at the hands of members of parliament (MPs) on the Privileges Committee on Tuesday afternoon. He was rebuffed by members of the panel, whose televised interrogation of Johnson is the major spectacle of a months-long investigation that could doom the former prime minister’s political future. Accepting that social distancing measures were broken, Johnson argued “it would have been impossible to have a drill sergeant measuring the distancing between us all hours of the day and night.” He defended his presence at leaving drinks for staffers, insisting that such events were necessary – even at a time when many Britons couldn’t visit their loved ones in hospital as Covid-19 killed hundreds of people each day. “A leaving do for everyone else in the country was not acceptable under the guidelines … so why was it acceptable and necessary for work purposes in Number 10?” a lawmaker asked Johnson. Johnson’s premiership came crashing down in 2022 after it emerged that dozens of social gatherings took place on his watch – some of which he personally attended – at a time when Britons were living under strict rules due to Covid-19. It shocked a public that for more than a year had put their lives on hold, unable to see colleagues, friends and even dying relatives as Britain plunged into and out of various stages of lockdown. Johnson has since attempted to launch a political comeback. But the inquiry into whether he lied in Parliament about those parties has the potential to imperil his career; if the committee recommends a lengthy suspension from Parliament, he could be forced to stand in a by-election in his tightly-fought constituency. The committee will not give its final report for at least a month. If it does find that Johnson knowingly misled lawmakers, it could still opt for a softer punishment – either a short suspension, which wouldn’t require a by-election, or merely the requirement that Johnson apologizes to the House. Johnson began his testimony on Wednesday by admitting to misleading Parliament over the existence of parties, but claiming he did so unknowingly. “I’m here to say to you, hand on heart, that I did not lie to the House,” Johnson said during his opening statement. He attacked the testimony of his former top adviser turned political foe, Dominic Cummings, saying “he has every motive to lie.” The frosty back-and-forth with the panel, during which Johnson raised his voice, pointed his finger and bristled with several committee members, rehashed a saga that appalled the British public and finally exposed a seemingly scandal-proof leader to the pull of political gravity. At the heart of the inquiry – beneath the minutiae of its testimonies and the hundreds of pages of legalese submitted as evidence – lies a simple question: Was Johnson truly so unaware of his own government’s Covid-19 guidance that he did not realize he was breaking it by attending parties inside Downing Street? The ex-prime minister is arguing that he was. Johnson accepts he misled Parliament, but he says it never occurred to him at the time that the gatherings were inappropriate, and so he did not knowingly mislead lawmakers when he told them that no rules were broken. Johnson has cut a combative figure at times during the hours-long session, a rare and humbling experience for a former statesman facing a possible exile from Parliament. His defense was scattershot in its scope; he also argued that some gatherings were appropriate for work purposes and sought to shift some culpability onto his advisers who, he claimed, had reassured him rules were followed. He also pointed to the “higgledy-piggledy” corridors inside Downing Street and asked how it would be possible to police social distancing. But his arguments were probed robustly by fellow MPs. The committee’s most recent report on the investigation says that the evidence “strongly suggests that breaches of guidance would have been obvious to Mr. Johnson at the time he was at the gatherings.” “It must have been obvious to you at the time, and even more obvious on reflection afterwards as this whole thing broke around you, that it was in breach of workplace guidance,” lawmaker Bernard Jenkins put to Johnson at one point. At several other occasions he was pressed to stop obfuscating. “You’re giving very long answers, and it’s taking longer than we need, and you’re repeating yourself quite a lot – can we just get on with the questions please?” he was asked. And when asked whether he considered the committee to be a “kangaroo court,” as some of his allies have suggested, Johnson declined to throw his full support behind his fellow lawmakers. “People will judge for themselves, on the basis of the evidence you have produced, the fairness of this committee. I have every confidence you will show that you can be fair,” he said. “Today was a new low for Boris Johnson,” the group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said in a statement while the former prime minister gave evidence. “He claims it was ‘his job’ to say goodbye to colleagues, that he ‘would have needed an electric fence’ around him to stick to the rules and that social distancing only applied ‘when possible’ … Did any of this apply when we couldn’t be with our loved ones for weeks as they suffered alone in care homes and hospitals, or even be there to hold their hands in their dying moments?” Wednesday’s hearing, which dissected in detail the circumstances of each individual gathering, seemed at times to be vaguely removed from reality: The damning public verdict on Partygate was established last year, and sentiment turned against Johnson so severely that he was ultimately forced from office. But the inquiry also has live and dangerous political implications for a politician who for more than two decades has enjoyed a celebrity profile and played a central role in bringing about Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Partygate was the single most significant factor in Johnson’s swift and spectacular political downfall; the ex-leader left Downing Street for the last time exactly 1,000 days after he won a landslide electoral victory that had sparked chatter of a new political dynasty. Now even Johnson’s ability to sit in Parliament is at stake. If the inquiry suggests a suspension of 10 days or more, and that recommendation is endorsed by a vote of MPs, Johnson will be forced to fight a by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, a seat that has been drifting towards the Labour Party in recent years and is firmly in the opposition’s sights. London’s Metropolitan Police issued more than 100 fines to people who worked in Downing Street for breaches of pandemic regulations at times the country was under varying degrees of lockdown. Johnson received one himself, for attending a gathering where he was presented with a birthday cake; his then-Chancellor, subsequently political rival and current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, was also fined. Johnson reminded the committee of that fact in a reference to Sunak that will have been unwelcome inside Downing Street, suggesting that if it were obvious to Johnson that rules were being broken, “it must have been obvious to others in the building, including the current Prime Minister.” A separate investigation by civil servant Sue Gray last year found that “the senior leadership at the centre” of Johnson’s administration “must bear responsibility” for a culture that allowed the parties to take place. She added there is “no excuse for some of the behaviour” she investigated, which included “excessive alcohol consumption.” Logs of email exchanges were also featured, including some where staff openly discussed hiding their partying from the media. More than 220,000 people have died in the United Kingdom as a result of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to government figures.

      Independent probe into alleged extrajudicial killings in Afghanistan by British military begins
    ","A probe into whether UK soldiers stormed the houses of two innocent Afghan families and summarily executed their relatives began Wednesday, part of an effort by investigators looking into allegations of war crimes committed by the British Armed Forces in Afghanistan – and the purported coverups that followed them. The two families, the Saifullahs and the Noorzais, lost four relatives each during separate incidents in February 2011 and October 2012. They have been seeking justice for more than a decade. The independent inquiry, commissioned by Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, was first announced in December. A member of the Noorzai family at the time recounted how his two brothers and his brother-in-law were all killed. “I was handcuffed, beaten and interrogated outside our family home by British soldiers. My relatives and friend were each shot in the head as they sat drinking tea,” the individual said. “My family has waited 10 years to find out why this happened.” While the probe stems from the two families’ legal battles, it will cover “numerous” alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan from mid-2010 until mid-2013, including those investigated by prominent British media organizations such as the The Sunday Times and BBC Panorama. Charles Anthony Haddon-Cave, the judge presiding over the investigation, asked anyone with information about the incidents in question to get in touch with his team. However, there is no clear mechanism yet on how his team would communicate with witnesses in Afghanistan, which is currently under the rule of the Taliban – the group British and American forces fought for years before the US withdrawal in 2021. Though some of the inquiry’s work, including several hearings, will be conducted behind closed doors due to national security reasons, Haddon-Cave said he intends to “hold open hearings where possible and where appropriate.” “Everybody has to understand the material I and my team are dealing with is highly sensitive,” he added. This is not the first time the British Armed Forces has been investigated for committing potential war crimes and then covering them up. The International Criminal Court launched a preliminary investigation into the British military’s conduct in Iraq but ended the examination in 2020 without pursuing an investigation due in part to the “inadequate” response of the British army at the time. The inquiry will also examine the previous Royal Military Police investigation that produced no prosecutions. A significant part of the inquiry’s work will be to determine “whether there was a coverup, when, by whom, [and] at what level,” Haddon-Cave said. Haddon-Cave said he has been assured by the relevant authorities that his team’s work will not be impeded. He said he has the power to compel witnesses and order the reproduction of documents. “I’m very hopeful that there will be full cooperation, not least because what we are looking at here is really restoring the reputation of the military and the country,” he said.

      Harris to close out ‘Invest in America’ tour by announcing $300M in bridge repair funding
    ","The Biden administration will announce nearly $300 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to repair and replace bridges across eight states and the District of Columbia Thursday, closing out its three week “Invest in America” tour highlighting legislative achievements under President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris will make the announcement at the Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge, which connects Washington, DC, to Northern Virginia and will receive $72 million in funding for repairs, the White House said. According to a fact sheet shared with CNN, the bridge serves over 88,000 vehicles per day. In addition, administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and infrastructure coordinator Mitch Landrieu, will fan out across the country to highlight bridge projects in San Diego; Bay City, Michigan; Albany, New York; Northwest Oklahoma; Portland, Oregon; Northwest South Carolina; San Antonio; and Madison, Wisconsin. The funding is the latest in a series of projects aimed at preserving and repairing the nation’s bridges, including last year’s Bridge Formula Program, which released $11 billion in Department of Transportation funding in 2022 and 2023 to states, tribes, and territories for bridge repairs. It also allocated $2.1 billion in Federal Highway Administration grants to make critical improvements to the Brent Spence Bridge connecting Kentucky and Ohio; the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco; the Gold Star Memorial Bridge in New London, Connecticut; and the Calumet River Bridges in Chicago. Since Biden signed the infrastructure law in November 2021, an official told reporters Wednesday, states, cities, tribes, and metropolitan planning organizations across the country have begun repairs on over 4,600 of the nation’s bridges. Thursday’s announcement marks the last stop on the administration’s “Invest in America” tour, which Biden launched last month by touring a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Durham, North Carolina. Per an administration official, 20 representatives from the Biden administration traveled to over 50 cities across 25 states during the tour, highlighting $435 billion in funding for 23,000 infrastructure projects in 4,500 cities and towns across the US.

      Democrats push abortion rights to the ballot in 2024, using an old GOP playbook
    ","Key Democrats hoping to keep abortion access a central part of the 2024 campaign are looking to the 2004 playbook of an old Republican nemesis: Karl Rove. Rove was the architect of ballot initiatives to ban gay marriage placed in swing states to boost turnout for George W. Bush. Now Democrats are pushing ballot measures and an array of other moves to try to capitalize on a backlash to last year’s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which they say was instrumental in many of their wins in last year’s midterms. “We should put the right to choose on every ballot across the country in 2024 – not just with the candidates we choose, but with referendum efforts to enshrine reproductive rights in states where right-wing politicians are stripping those rights away,” Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker told CNN. With President Joe Biden expected to run for reelection and Democrats forecasting tough races for key Senate and House seats, several Democratic operatives say next year is the perfect moment to turn Rove’s wedge-issue strategy on its head and get swing voters excited about abortion rights – the same way an abortion rights ballot proposition in Michigan helped power a massive blue wave in the state last year. The frustration with threats to abortion access hasn’t faded, Democrats – from Biden’s close advisers to organizers across the country – agree. Their proof is Tuesday’s blowout win by Democrats’ preferred candidate in Wisconsin. The state Supreme Court race came with high stakes for abortion access given the court is expected to decide the fate of the state’s 1849 ban, which had been dormant for decades but snapped back into place with last year’s US Supreme Court ruling. “In 2024, voters will be deciding whether to elect people who want a national abortion ban,” said Ben Wikler, the Democratic Party chair in the state. “Republicans nationally will feel the fury that Wisconsin feels now.” Even some conservatives are raising the alarm. After the Wisconsin election, conservative commentator Ann Coulter, referring to last summer’s US Supreme Court decision, tweeted: “Pro-lifers: WE WON. Abortion is not a ‘constitutional right’ anymore!” She suggested that new abortion restrictions are backfiring on the GOP. “Please stop pushing strict limits on abortion, or there will be no Republicans left,” she added. Rove didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Democrats invoking him in their political strategy. But Democrats are counting on new restrictions being pushed by Republicans in Congress and in many state legislatures – including a ban on abortions after six weeks that could soon head to the desk of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s in final deliberations about launching a presidential campaign – to keep stoking fresh backlash. That will only be accentuated, they argue, if a Texas judge’s ruling in a pending case leads to a restriction in access to a common abortion medication, even in states where the procedure is legal. Some in the party continue to push for economic issues to be their preeminent message. But abortion rights advocates and top Democratic operatives say they’ll look to tie every Republican candidate – for president all the way down the ticket – to the hardest-line abortion restrictions, which polls show are broadly unpopular. And they’ll do it, they say, by tapping into what they think is a more widely resonant argument about bringing people together to push back on government overreach and stripping them of their rights. “It’s time for Democrats to take this fight directly to the people,” Pritzker said. “Let’s make the choice for voters in 2024 crystal clear.” The ballot propositions are part of a patchwork, ad hoc strategy that collections of activists, advocates and operatives are sorting out on the state and local levels, as they wait for Biden to make a final decision about running and setting the tone for a national campaign. More than 20 lieutenant governors, for example, led by Connecticut’s Susan Bysiewicz, have started a coalition to share tactics and information as they push to protect abortion rights in their states. And groups of Democratic state attorneys general have come together in joint lawsuits aimed at trying to undermine a possible decision from the Texas judge against the abortion pill. In New York – where six Republicans who represent congressional districts where Biden won in 2020 are top targets for the party nationally – the Democratic-dominated state legislature has already put a measure on the ballot for next year. Maryland legislators moved to add their own proposal to the 2024 ballot at the end of March. “There’s no doubt it will energize voters to fight for their fundamental rights,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN. Hochul, a Democrat who convened a special session of the state legislature last year after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, said that even though abortion rights didn’t appear to move many voters in her very blue state last year, there’s still a need for abortion rights politicians to push for more. “We’ve all seen the terrifying ways other states are trying to roll back reproductive rights, and we know it’s up to us to fight back,” said Hochul. There’s a burgeoning effort by some abortion rights activists in Florida for a potential ballot proposition there, and the process is already well underway in the key battleground state of Arizona, as well as in Colorado. Efforts are also underway in Montana, people advising them tell CNN, and in Nevada – each of which will have a Senate race that could determine the majority. Activists are also expecting Republicans to try get an abortion proposition on the ballot in Iowa, where state legislators are advancing a proposition that would impose new restrictions. Asked if Pritzker would be funding ballot proposition efforts in other states, a spokesperson for the billionaire governor pointed to his past financial support of the issue, including in last year’s ballot initiative in Michigan and in support of the Democrats’ preferred Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate. Nationally, Biden advisers say that Vice President Kamala Harris will take the lead on the abortion issue – as she did in the 2022 midterms – in the plans for a reelection campaign while the president would also push to codify Roe v. Wade as part of his own pitch. Harris is planning to expand her national tour on reproductive rights, like her trip to Iowa in March, which was specifically geared to call attention to the Republican presidential candidates who’ve been landing in the state. Harris aides say she has been keeping tabs on the medication abortion case out of Texas, warning fellow Democrats about the consequences for other medications if this Food and Drug Administration approval is reversed, but has also been reaching out behind the scenes – checking with legislators who’ve protected abortion rights in their states and with Virginia state Sen. Aaron Rouse about how talking about abortion rights helped him win a January special election that flipped a seat. “People around our country are concerned, afraid, confused, desperate, in many ways feeling alone,” Harris said recently as she met with Iowa state legislators who support abortion rights in Des Moines. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who survived a tight reelection last year in which she spoke often about abortion rights, argues that the way to appeal to Republican voters and independents is to talk about how the GOP is being taken over by extremists. “It is such a personal, emotional, important issue for people that my colleagues on the far right do not understand why it will continue to resonate,” Cortez Masto said. That’s in line with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, the two national nonpartisan groups at the forefront of organizing the ballot proposition campaigns in 2022 and as well as those taking shape for 2024. (The ACLU just spent $900,000 on its own radio ads in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.) There’s a natural fit, operatives at both groups say, in talking about taking back power from governments that took rights away. “We continue to see a lot of promise in appealing directly to voters who are so with us on this on the issue,” said ACLU senior political strategist Carolyn Ehrlich, arguing the ballot propositions from last year are “a roadmap for protecting rights in states where the legislature is a roadblock to progress.” Ballot propositions that would have further restricted abortion were defeated last year in deep-red states like Kansas and Kentucky – major victories for abortion rights advocates. And after Republicans fell short of their hopes of a “red wave” in the midterms, those advocates and aligned operatives argue that the GOP has largely been pushed into a corner. “I don’t think we’re going to have to nuance anything to voters. What we’re going to have to do is to communicate to voters where the parties stand,” said EMILY’s List President Laphonza Butler. New attacks on reproductive rights will only further enrage and mobilize their voters, said NARAL President Mini Timmaraju. “Every single candidate for public office next year will have no choice but to go on the record with their position, and we’ll be there to hold them accountable or lift them up,” Timmaraju said. Talking about abortion has already proven complicated for the emerging Republican presidential field. Former President Donald Trump, whose three Supreme Court nominees helped overturn Roe v. Wade, lashed out after the midterms to say “‘the abortion issue’” was “poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on no exceptions.” Former Vice President Mike Pence has remained an advocate of a national abortion ban. Other prospective candidates have stopped short of that while making announcements of their own: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin has pushed a 15-week ban in his state – except in the case of rape, incest and the health of the mother – as he eyes a potential moderate lane in the race. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who has announced her candidacy, says she wouldn’t support a full federal ban but has expressed openness to the 15-week federal ban for most abortions introduced last year by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, though she hasn’t taken a firm position. Fellow South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, asked on Fox News earlier this month about the bill in his state that would allow the death penalty to be imposed on women who receive abortions, said it was “a terrible idea” and then quickly shut down the conversation. A spokesperson for Scott, whose travel schedule in recent months has looked like that of a likely presidential candidate, did not respond to a CNN interview request to elaborate. Similar bills are being introduced by Republican legislators in several other states, including ones that would reclassify abortion as murder and ones that could apply “wrongful death” to embryos frozen as part of IVF fertility treatments. Anti-abortion activists aren’t leaving much room for compromise. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser declared in a call with reporters in January that any Republican who doesn’t back a federal abortion ban or restrictions that moved toward one has “disqualified him or herself as a presidential candidate in our eyes.” That applies for candidates for other offices too, Dannenfelser warned. And, she said, she wants candidates speaking loudly and clearly about more restrictions they’d support rather than trying to avoid the issue. To do otherwise, she said, would be an “ostrich strategy.” ",1909,politics,2023-04-07,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/07/politics/democrats-abortion-ballot-measures-2024/index.html

      Vice President Kamala Harris hires Stephanie Young to be new senior adviser
    ","Stephanie Young, a veteran Democratic aide, has been tapped to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ new senior adviser to focus on messaging and outreach. Young’s role is a new position for the vice president’s office, meant to take a birds-eye approach to manage Harris’ overall communications platform and political engagement but not fill the role of a day-to-day communications director. Her second communications director in two years, Jamal Simmons, departed the office around New Year’s for family reasons. The role still has not been filled. Harris’ image has been under intense scrutiny since taking office. The vice president has been the target of snubs from both Democrats and Republicans, who’ve criticized her performance in various rounds of negative stories. It’s led to an often defensive messaging strategy from the office, with aides focused on protecting the vice president and the White House sharing social media posts depicting how in lockstep she is with President Joe Biden. Allies of Harris have complained that she’s under the spotlight more than any other modern day vice president, a reality that often appeared to catch the administration off guard in the beginning of its tenure. A White House official said Young’s role would mirror that of an inner circle senior counselor meant to be at the nexus of political engagement and messaging. CNN previously reported that a possible restructuring has remained underway for months to give Harris what several involved feel is a much needed role of senior counselor, in absence of a communications director. The vice president’s chief of staff Lorraine Voles announced Young’s new position in an email to staff Friday afternoon. “In her new role, she will advise the Vice President on messaging and manage communications. Having previously served in the public engagement team of the Obama Administration, Stephanie will also leverage her previous experience to inform the outreach strategy and efforts of the office,” Voles wrote in the email obtained by CNN. Young’s new role will likely prove useful as Biden is expected to launch a bid for reelection in the coming months, with Harris at his side. Young will join the office after serving as the Executive Director of When We All Vote, a voting initiate launched by former first lady Michelle Obama. Obama praised Young in a press release that announced her departure Friday, crediting her for helping build the organization up from the ground. “Over the past five years, I’ve seen Stephanie become a strategic, creative, and passionate leader who has left a lasting mark on the way Americans engage with their democracy. Her work at When We All Vote has helped to truly shift our culture of voting—and I know that her work in the months and years ahead will continue to make our country even stronger,” the former first lady wrote. Those same skills, the official said, would help the office streamline communication needs to help the vice president and make the case for the Biden administration on the road. Young also worked for the Obama White House, House Democratic Leadership and the Congressional Black Caucus. This story has been updated with additional developments.

      US government’s proposal to boost EV sales is challenging but not impossible
    ","The US government is planning to change auto emissions standards in a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. By 2032, electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of all the new cars sold in America. Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out. Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too. It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different. ‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a gas-powered car, he said. At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster. So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said. There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%. Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032. California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it’s on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market. “California’s influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,” he said. Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable. The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand. “Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,” said Drury. ” I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don’t want anything other than Toyotas.” Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, the BZ4X SUV, but more are planned. Honda, another Japanese brand with a loyal following, offers no EVs currently but the company is gearing up factories in Ohio to build future EV models. Honda expects to offer its first EV next year. General Motors also has a number of EV models coming in the next year or two. GM, on its own, will provide a good test of the American market’s readiness for EVs in the next couple of years, said Drury. That automaker, which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035, will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country, posted a statement on its website expressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies. “[A] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” the group wrote in its statement. At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor. Once consumers start broadly embracing EVs, continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.

      FBI warns consumers not to use public phone charging stations
    ","The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software. Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to a tweet last week from the FBI’s Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples. “Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,” the agency advised in the tweet. While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term “juice jacking” to describe the problem. “Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,” Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8, explained to CNN in 2017. The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer. If a port is compromised, there’s no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts. “The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,” Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI’s Denver branch, told CNN. “This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling.” The Federal Communications Commission also updated a blog post on Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords. “In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,” according to the FCC blog post. “There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.” ",337,tech,2023-04-12,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/fbi-public-charging-port-warning/index.html

      Tesla is opening a Megafactory for huge batteries in China
    ","Tesla will open a Megapack battery factory in Shanghai, it said on Sunday, as it doubles down on its investment in China even as political tension rises between Beijing and Washington. The news was announced just days after Airbus unveiled plans for a second final-assembly line in the country’s north, with officials publicly rolling out the welcome wagon for foreign investors. The Tesla factory will be able to produce 10,000 Megapacks, which are very large batteries used to store huge amounts of electricity, the company said in 
            
                a tweet. It announced the new factory with a picture of a signing ceremony in China. “Tesla opening Megapack factory in Shanghai to supplement output of Megapack factory in California,” Elon Musk said on Twitter. Megapacks are meant to be used as massive batteries to help stabilize energy grids. Each unit can store enough energy to power an average of 3,600 homes for one hour, the company says. They are designed for utilities and large-scale commercial projects, not vehicles. Chinese state media outlet Xinhua was the first to report the news, saying the electric automaker will break ground in this year’s third quarter and begin production in the second quarter of 2024. The Shanghai facility would have the same level of production capacity as Tesla’s Megafactory in Lathrop, California — equivalent to 40 gigawatt-hours of energy storage. “We believe this announcement is a potential game changer for Tesla on the battery front,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “In this EV [electric vehicle] arms race Tesla is further building its lead in battery technology with the new Megapack factory in China another flex the muscle moment for Musk.” Last month, Apple
            
                (AAPL)’s Tim Cook visited Beijing in show of support for the country as a market and manufacturing base amid escalating political rhetoric between the United States and China. The Megafactory will be located in Lingang, an enormous free trade zone on the outskirts of Shanghai, where Tesla’s electric-vehicle Gigafactory broke ground in 2019. That facility was built within 10 months, at 65% of the cost of the Model 3 production plant in the United States. Within a few years, it became the biggest EV production plant on the planet. The Shanghai facility is Tesla’s main export hub, supplying vehicles to most markets outside of North America. Tesla is also making inroads among Chinese drivers. Last week, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said the company sold 88,869 units of Shanghai-made EVs in March. According to Reuters, that figure was 35% higher than a year ago. Tesla is the second largest EV maker in the country behind market leader BYD
            
                (BYDDF), which sold 206,089 units last month. In January, Tesla slashed prices in China for the second time in less than three months, in an effort to boost sales as amid slowing demand in the world’s largest car market. The cuts came days after Beijing ended a 13-year-long subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, a move that is expected to put further pressure on car demand. The Chinese government had planned to phase out its costly EV subsidy program by the end of 2020, but extended it during the pandemic to avert a sharp economic slowdown. For 2023, the CPCA estimates sales of “new energy cars,” which are mostly EVs, to reach 8.5 million units, which will account for 36% of total car sales, according to the official China Securities Journal. Total passenger cars sales in China hit 20.5 million units in 2022, up just 1.9% from the year before, the association was quoted as saying, as the country dealt with the impact of strict Zero-covid controls that were relaxed only late in the year. — Chris Isidore and Laura He contributed to this article.

      Lachlan Murdoch drops defamation suit against Australian outlet Crikey in wake of massive Dominion settlement
    ","Fox Corporation chief executive Lachlan Murdoch on Friday dropped his defamation lawsuit against the publisher of Crikey, the scrappy Australian news and commentary site, after it published an article last year that called him an “unindicted co-conspirator” in the January 6 attack, his lawyer said. Murdoch’s lawyer, John Churchill, said Murdoch remained “confident” that he could ultimately prevail in the case, which had been scheduled to go to trial later this year. But, Churchill said, Murdoch did not wish to “litigate a case from another jurisdiction that has already been settled and facilitate a marketing campaign designed to attract subscribers and boost their profits.” The decision comes just days after Fox News, which is controlled by the Murdoch family, settled a defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems for $787 million, in the largest publicly known defamation settlement involving a US media company. And follows another settlement last week with a Venezuelan businessman who had accused Fox News of making false claims about him and the 2020 election. Crikey explored admitting some of the revelations from the Dominion lawsuit as evidence in its own case, a move that Murdoch’s lawyer referenced in the Thursday statement. Private Media said the retreat was “a substantial victory for legitimate public interest journalism.” “We stand by our position that Lachlan Murdoch was culpable in promoting the lie of the 2020 election result because he, and his father, had the power to stop the lies,” the company said in a statement. “How do we know? Because Dominion sued Fox News for promoting the lies and Fox just paid 1.17 billion [Australian dollars] to Dominion to settle the case.” “We are proud to have exposed the hypocrisy and abuse of power of a media billionaire,” the company said. “This is a victory for free speech. We won.” The legal dispute centers on a 2022 Crikey story that carried the headline, “Trump is a confirmed unhinged traitor. And Murdoch is his unindicted co-conspirator.” After the article was published, Murdoch demanded the story be removed and the outlet apologize. Crikey did temporarily take down the story but declined to issue an apology. That did not satisfy Murdoch. When Murdoch and Crikey failed to reach a resolution, the outlet reposted the story and published the legal threats it had received from Murdoch’s camp, calling them the “Lachlan Murdoch Letters.” The outlet further took out advertisements daring Murdoch to sue. Murdoch followed through on the dare, filing a lawsuit against Crikey publisher Private Media. Crikey and Private Media said throughout the legal process that they would defend themselves and were confident in their case. Had the case gone to trial, it would have put Murdoch in an uncomfortable position. Not only would he have been ensnared in another high-profile defamation case, his camp would have had to make effectively the opposite arguments it has made in the United States in regard to defamation law.

      Smartmatic could be Fox’s next big problem
    ","Fox News’ legal battle with Dominion Voting Systems is over. It now has to deal with Smartmatic, which is seeking billions of dollars more than its rival wanted in damages. The voting technology company filed a lawsuit against Fox in New York state courts for defamation following the 2020 election, and is seeking $2.7 billion in damages from Fox and other defendants. Dominion wanted “only” $1.6 billion and settled with Fox for $787 million Tuesday. Both lawsuits focus on Fox News’ coverage of the 2020 election, including lies about voter fraud. Baseless conspiracy theories peddled about Smartmatic, which mimicked those pushed against Dominion, falsely suggested that the company’s technology was used throughout the country and allowed the vote to be rigged against Trump. Some strains of the conspiracy theory pushed on Fox aimed to tie the company to the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez. Other strains suggested that Dominion used Smartmatic’s voting software in swing states and that votes were exported out of the country to be tabulated; both assertions were false, and Smartmatic pointed out in its lawsuit that it doesn’t work with Dominion as the two companies are competitors. “We have no choice,” Antonio Mugica, the chief executive and founder of Smartmatic, told CNN Business in an interview about the company’s decision to file the lawsuit in February 2021. “The disinformation campaign that was launched against us is an obliterating one. For us, this is existential, and we have to take action.” After more than two years of legal wrangling, Fox reached a last-second settlement  with Dominion, agreeing to the biggest publicly known defamation payout by a US media company in history. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the Dominion case revealed that on-air hosts and executives, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway. Smartmatic says it plans to pull back the curtain even further. “Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign,” Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said in a statement after the settlement. “Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.” After that lawsuit was filed in February 2021, a Fox spokesperson said, “We are proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court.” The network denies any wrongdoing. – CNN’s Marshall Cohen and Oliver Darcy contributed to this report ",424,media,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/media/fox-news-smartmatic-dominion-settlement/index.html

      Smartmatic wants more than Dominion’s $787 million payout, plus a retraction from Fox for its 2020 election lies, lawyer says
    ","A top lawyer for Smartmatic, the voting technology company whose defamation lawsuit against Fox News is still pending, said Thursday that he won’t accept any settlement smaller than the $787 million Fox agreed to pay Dominion, and that his client needs a “full retraction” from the right-wing network disavowing the lies it spread about the 2020 presidential election. “They need to get an apology. They need to get a full retraction,” Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead.” That is something Dominion Voting Systems wasn’t able to extract from Fox as part of its historic $787 million settlement, which was clinched Tuesday, as the trial was on the brink of opening statements. (But in a press release, Fox publicly “acknowledged” that the judge in that case had concluded that all 20 on-air statements that Dominion sued over were false.) Connolly said Smartmatic is “looking to take this case through trial” and wants “the vindication of a jury verdict in their favor.” But if there were to be an out-of-court settlement, the deal would need to include the retraction plus a payout larger than the massive sum that Dominion got. “That set down a marker and it’s a marker that we think we should be exceeding,” Connolly said. “The scope of the damage done to Smartmatic is a global scale, because we operate globally… $787 million is a good start. But it’s not the right finishing point.” He blasted Fox for perpetrating the myth that Smartmatic “somehow masterminded an ability to rig a national election when we were only in one county” in 2020 — Los Angeles County — adding, that level of “recklessness is something you don’t normally see.” Fox denies wrongdoing and is fighting the lawsuit, which is unfolding in New York state courts. Smartmatic wants $2.7 billion from Fox and other Trump allies that it named in the lawsuit. “We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on its face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.” The parties will meet face-to-face next week for a hearing in Manhattan, about potential evidentiary issues in the case, with Smartmatic seeking more internal materials from Fox.

      Appeals court largely sides with Apple on ‘Fortnite’ antitrust case
    ","A federal appeals court largely sided with Apple on Monday in a closely watched case about its app store policies, a decision that could complicate future efforts to regulate app store operators and frustrate claims that Apple behaves monopolistically. The decision in the case involving Epic Games, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite,” upholds a lower court ruling that found Apple is not a monopolist in the distribution of iOS apps, and that Apple did not violate antitrust laws by requiring app developers to use Apple’s proprietary in-app payment systems. In reaching its conclusion, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said Epic Games failed to show how Apple could have implemented “alternative means for Apple to accomplish the procompetitive justifications supporting iOS’s walled garden ecosystem.” Apple grounds its app store restrictions in security and privacy rationales that differentiate the company from other mobile operating system makers such as Google, the court said, creating “a heterogenous market for app-transaction platforms which, as a result, increases interbrand competition” between iOS and Android. In a statement, Apple said the court had handed it a “resounding victory.” “For the second time in two years, a federal court has ruled that Apple abides by antitrust laws at the state and federal levels. The App Store continues to promote competition, drive innovation, and expand opportunity, and we’re proud of its profound contributions to both users and developers around the world,” the company said. “We respectfully disagree with the court’s ruling on the one remaining claim under state law and are considering further review.” Epic said “Apple prevailed at the 9th Circuit Court.” It added: “Though the court upheld the ruling that Apple’s restraints have ‘a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers’, they found we didn’t prove our Sherman Act case.” The ruling comes as policymakers worldwide have begun circling around app store providers with legislation and investigations that view the industry’s practices skeptically. For years, app makers have accused Apple and Google of charging excessive fees, imposing burdensome restrictions and bullying developers who protest the policies. Epic and Google are embroiled in a separate lawsuit over similar issues. The high-stakes legal battle in Epic Games v. Apple first arose in 2020, when Epic sought to trigger a confrontation with Apple by telling Fortnite players they could purchase the game’s virtual currency, V-Bucks, at a lower price if they did so directly on Epic’s website rather than through the iOS app. Apple responded by removing Fortnite from the iOS App Store, a move Epic anticipated and that prompted Epic to sue. Apple countersued Epic, accusing it of breach of contract. On Monday, in addition to siding with Apple on the antitrust claims, the appeals court held that Apple is entitled to have Epic cover its legal fees stemming from the countersuit, reversing a lower-court decision. The appeals court agreed with the lower court, however, that Apple violated California’s unfair competition law when, in its developer agreement, Apple forbade Epic from informing iOS users about other ways they could pay for in-game virtual currency besides using Apple’s in-app payment system. Monday’s ruling upholds an injunction that, if allowed to take effect, would prevent Apple from intervening when developers include “buttons, external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms” apart from Apple’s own channels. The court also held that developer agreements such as the ones Apple signs with app makers are subject to the nation’s anti-monopoly laws, contrary to the lower-court ruling. That finding could give some ammunition to critics of app store operators. Both sides now have several weeks to determine whether to seek a rehearing from the appeals court or to appeal to the Supreme Court.

      Six small things you can do this year to improve your financial future
    ","You know very well you could do a million things to improve your financial situation. The problem, though, is that changing a million things means you’ll basically have to change way too much about how you live. And who ever does that voluntarily, let alone sticks with it? If you really want to improve your finances — and your long-term financial security — you’ll have a much better shot at doing so if you just pick two to three small, achievable goals that allow you to see progress over six to 12 months. Getting those boxes checked will encourage you to keep going. “The most important thing is to keep it simple. Incremental, implementable and imperfect,” said Brent Weiss, co-founder and head of financial wellness at Facet, a financial planning firm. “The most we’ll work on is three things, because life happens,” he added. “It’s not about changing your life but changing a couple of things to improve your financial health.” Before deciding on your specific two or three to-dos, Weiss suggests getting a quick snapshot of where your finances stand right now: How much money do you bring in every month? How much do you pay out? How much are you saving currently and how much are you spending? How much are your assets worth? And what are your liabilities? Once you’ve done that, look a little more deeply into your spending patterns. Break down where your money is going specifically and create a “needs” column and a “wants” column, said Rose Niang, the financial planning director at Edelman Financial Engines. So, for instance, paying your rent or mortgage is a definite need. Buying yourself flowers once a month is a want. The point is not to rob you of your wants. It’s to get a clearer sense of what money is available for you to redeploy if you decide other things are more important to you in your quest to improve your financial picture. Here are some examples of easily implemented changes you might want to make this year, depending on your priorities. If bumping up your savings will make you feel calmer and happier, start small if money is otherwise tight. Even an increase of one or two percentage points a year can make a noticeable difference over time — whether your goal is to increase savings for retirement, college tuition, emergencies, a down payment or even a bucket-list trip. Yet it won’t take a big bite out of your discretionary income. “You’ll be surprised how you don’t notice it,” Niang said. If your savings contribution rate for retirement in your employer’s 401(k) or 403(b) plan is very low, bumping it up by an extra percentage point or two — say, from 5% of your salary to 6% or 7% — will give you a triple advantage: more money saved, a bigger matching contribution from your employer and a bigger deduction this year on your taxes because your retirement contributions are tax deferred. Credit card interest rates are at record highs this year. So while a 1% to 2% increase in the money you put toward paying down debt can help, throwing more at it will really pay off in the short- and long-term, because too much of your hard-earned money is going to pay down interest costs rather than your principal. One option to pay down your debt while minimizing your interest costs might be to find a good balance transfer card with an initial 0% rate that can last for up to 21 months. Make sure the card has very low fees and penalties, and that you can commit to paying off your balance before the zero-rate period ends. Assume interest rates will remain as high as they are now or go even higher from here as the Federal Reserve continues to hike its benchmark rate in a continued bid to quash inflation. If you have been relying on your credit card as your just-in-case fund, Niang warns: “This is not the year to do that.” Better to start setting aside money now to help cover your near-term expenses if you lose your job or get hit with a pricey emergency. Niang also recommends that anyone with a variable-rate private student loan look into refinancing it into a fixed-rate loan to protect against higher rates in the future. And if you’re in the market to buy a home, the more you can put down on the property, the less you will pay in interest costs over time. If you have young children and want to make sure they will be financially secure if you die prematurely, you might consider augmenting whatever life insurance policy your employer provides. You also might want to meet with an estate planning attorney to see whether a trust makes sense, given the particulars of your family and tax situation. Unless you’re an investing genius who knows what the future holds, you would do well to avoid putting all your investment money into one basket. So make sure your portfolio remains diversified across stocks and bonds, different investing styles (e.g., growth and value stocks; corporate and governmental debt, etc.) and different sectors (e.g., technology, manufacturing, and health care). What exactly the splits should be will depend on both your time horizon and risk tolerance. But the goal is to ensure positive, long-term returns on your portfolio. “Markets are cyclical,” Niang noted. “So you diversify in hopes that when one side is doing badly, another is doing well.” ",916,success,2023-03-06,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/06/success/improving-financial-future/index.html

      CFPB: What it does and why its future is in question
    ","The US Supreme Court decided this week to hear a case that will consider the constitutionality of funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and, in doing so, test the constraints of US regulators’ power. The case would be heard in the fall, with a decision likely by summer 2024. But what is the CFPB? How does its work affect your wallet? And why is its future potentially at risk? The agency was created after the 2008 financial meltdown, as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. That law was passed in the wake of the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis and the Great Recession that followed. The broad purpose of the CFPB is to protect consumers from financial abuses and to serve as the central agency for consumer financial protection authorities. Prior to its creation, as the agency notes on its site, “[c]onsumer financial protection had not been the primary focus of any federal agency, and no agency had effective tools to set the rules for and oversee the whole market.” The CFPB has regulatory authority over providers of many types of financial products and services, including credit cards, banking accounts, loan servicing, credit reporting and consumer debt collection. It is charged with implementing and enforcing consumer protection laws, making rules and issuing guidance for consumer financial institutions. And it is the place consumers can go to lodge complaints about financial products and services. Importantly, Dodd-Frank also gave the agency new authority to determine whether any given consumer financial product or service is unfair, deceptive or abusive and therefore unlawful. While there are critics of the agency’s current structure and funding, it has saved consumers money, made it easier for them to seek redress and to get better clarity and more tailored responses from companies when they have a problem with their accounts, loans or credit reports. “It has completely changed the consumer financial marketplace. Overall it has had a tremendous impact on making it more fair and transparent,” said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. For instance, the CFPB has taken action against bank overdraft policies. “Arguably, the focus on overdraft practices has led some banks to eliminate or reduce their overdraft fees,” said Christine Hines, legislative director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. And it has gone after institutions for saddling consumers with pointless products, excessive fees and punitive terms. Both Hines and Saunders made a special note of CFPB’s actions against Wells Fargo, after the agency found the bank had been engaging in multiple abusive and unlawful consumer practices across several financial products between 2011 and 2022 — from auto loans to mortgage loans to bank accounts. Last month, the agency required the bank to pay more than $2 billion to customers who were harmed by such practices, plus a $1.7 billion fine that will go into a relief fund for victims. “More than 16 million accounts at Wells Fargo were subject to their illegal practices, including misapplied payments, wrongful foreclosures, and incorrect fees and interest charges,” the agency said in a blog post. In the area of mortgages, “CFPB has written rules to implement new protections so that mortgage lenders don’t make loans with tricks and traps that lead people to lose their homes,” Saunders said. It also has created other safeguards, including rules on how service providers should communicate with borrowers who want to find alternatives to foreclosure, Hines noted. Currently, the agency is in the midst of an effort to curb excessive or “junk” fees on a range of consumer financial products, such as credit card late fees. Critics of the CFPB have been trying for years to limit its power and independence, attacking the way the agency is structured and funded. Like federal banking regulators, its funding is not determined by lawmakers in Congress as part of the annual appropriations process. Rather, it gets its money from the Federal Reserve System’s earnings. “This nontraditional funding source limits congressional oversight of the agency and is the subject of legal challenges,” according to the Congressional Research Service. The latest challenge — arising from a federal appeals court ruling that CFPB’s funding violates the Constitution’s Appropriations Clause and separation of powers — is what the Supreme Court will take up in its October term. While it’s impossible to predict how the justices will rule, should they decide to uphold the appeals court ruling, that will put in doubt how the agency will be funded going forward, and whether it can continue to function effectively. It’s also unclear whether the agency’s actions and rule-making over the past 11 years would be invalidated, nor what impact it would have on banks and other financial institutions that have set up systems to be in compliance with CFPB rules and safe harbors. “The agency would be unable to do anything if the funding is invalidated. And prior rules could be challenged as the agency did not have a legal funding source that it could use to write those rules,” Cowen Washington Research Group analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note to clients.

      The US gender pay gap: Why it hasn’t narrowed much in 20 years
    ","A lot can change in two decades. Or… not. In 2022, US women on average earned about 82 cents for every dollar a man earned, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly earnings of both full- and part-time workers. That’s a big leap from the 65 cents that women were earning in 1982. But it has barely moved from the 80 cents they were earning in 2002. “Higher education, a shift to higher-paying occupations and more labor market experience have helped women narrow the gender pay gap since 1982,” the Pew analysis noted. “But even as women have continued to outpace men in educational attainment, the pay gap has been stuck in a holding pattern since 2002, ranging from 80 to 85 cents to the dollar.” Before getting to potential reasons why the pay gap hasn’t narrowed for two decades — let alone disappeared — it’s worth noting that the top-line average doesn’t tell the whole story of what’s been going on for women in different cohorts. Take age: Women between the ages of 25 and 34 are much closer to achieving pay parity with men than they are likely to be when they get older. Since 2007, younger women have been earning about 90 cents on the dollar, according to Pew: “But even as pay parity might appear in reach for women at the start of their careers, the wage gap tends to increase as they age.” Having children is a factor, Pew found. For example, parenthood leads some women to put their careers on hold, or put in a shorter workweek. For employed fathers between the ages 35 and 44, having children at home is a time that often coincides with receiving higher pay even though the pay of employed mothers that same age is unaffected. “In 2022, mothers ages 25 to 34 earned 85% as much as fathers that age, but women without children at home earned 97% as much as fathers. In contrast, employed women ages 35 to 44 — with or without children — both earned about 80% as much as fathers,” the report said. Or take race and ethnicity: Pew found that Black women last year earned just 70% as much as White men. Hispanic women earned 65% as much. For White women, the gap was less, at 83%. Asian women were closest to parity, at 93%. “To some extent, the gender wage gap varies by race and ethnicity because of differences in education, experience, occupation and other factors that drive the gender wage gap for women overall,” the Pew analysis noted. “But researchers have uncovered new evidence of hiring discrimination against various racial and ethnic groups, along with discrimination against other groups, such as LGBTQ and disabled workers,” the report continued. “Discrimination in hiring may feed into differences in earnings by shutting out workers from opportunities,” Lastly, consider occupation: Women are still overrepresented in lower-paying occupations such as personal care and service jobs; and underrepresented in higher-paying ones, like managerial and STEM jobs. Regardless, the gender pay gap is typically narrowest when you pick any single occupation and control for measurable factors between men and women like education, tenure and hours worked. “But it never goes away,” said Rakesh Kochhar, a Pew senior researcher. The persistence of a gap over the past 20 years, even when comparing apples to apples, suggests there are other factors at play. These can include potential discrimination. When Pew asked Americans in October what factors they believed played a role in the gender wage gap, half indicated a major reason is that employers treat women differently. Women were much more likely than men (61% vs 37%) to cite this as a major reason. Another factor that may help explain the stickiness of the pay gap is that the wage premium for those with college degrees has grown smaller. So while more employed women (48%) now have at least a bachelor’s degree than men (41%), it is worth less. Individual choices such as taking periods away from the workforce to care for children also continue to play a role. Those choices may be borne of cultural norms, societal issues such as a lack of affordable child care, or personal preference. Narrowing the gender pay gap from here may be tough sledding. “More sustained progress in closing the pay gap may depend on deeper changes in societal and cultural norms and in workplace flexibility that affect how men and women balance their careers and family lives,” Pew researchers suggested. And even then, progress may be slower than desired, since, as they noted, “even in countries that have taken the lead in implementing family-friendly policies, such as Denmark, parenthood continues to drive a significant wedge in the earnings of men and women.” ",795,success,2023-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/success/gender-pay-gap-pew/index.html

      There are new rules about severance agreements. Here’s what you need to know
    ","There have been many questions raised about the implications and reach of a recent decision by the National Labor Relations Board to prohibit employers from requiring laid off workers to sign certain types of non-disparagement and confidentiality clauses if they want to receive severance. Who’s covered by it? Is it retroactive? Can my employer no longer ever require that I stay quiet in exchange for severance? CNN Business put these and other questions to some employment lawyers to get their take. Here are their answers. 1. Who does the new prohibition apply to? Most US private sector employers are subject to NLRB’s authority and must abide by its decisions. And its recent decision will apply both to their union and non-union workers. “This board is signaling and reminding employers that the NLRB applies to employers regardless of whether workers are unionized,” said Andrew Herman, an associate in the labor & employment practice at law firm Blank Rome LLP. 2. Who is not covered by the ban? Select groups are not subject to NLRB’s authority. Federal, state and local government agencies, including public schools, libraries and parks, are not under NLRB’s jurisdiction. Neither are railways and airlines. Some categories of workers are not likely covered by the ban, because they are excluded under the National Labor Relations Act, which the NLRB enforces. They include: Supervisors and managers with the authority to hire, fire, set pay and discipline workers, even if their company itself is subject to NLRB authority; independent contractors; agricultural and domestic workers; and anyone employed by a parent or spouse. 3. Is the ruling retroactive? That’s hard to say definitively. The decision the NLRB published does not explicitly say it’s retroactive, Herman noted. Generally speaking, NLRB decisions may be presumed to be retroactive “unless it would be unfair to the employer or result in an injustice,” said employee-side attorney Michael Healey of Wagner, Falconer & Judd Ltd. In this latest case, Healey said, it’s fair to assume that it might not be because employers have been offering severance agreements in recent years based on a 2020 NLRB decision that was effectively overturned by the board’s latest ruling. That said, the lawyers CNN spoke to agreed that it’s possible the labor board might consider applying it retroactively if someone files a charge for an alleged labor violation pertaining to a severance agreement that was signed or enforced within the past six months. Normally there is a six-month window akin to a statute of limitations to bring an alleged violation to the board’s attention. 4. So can employers now never require me to stay mum about the company as a condition of receiving severance? No, they still can in some circumstances. The NLRB’s decision last week prohibits employers from requiring laid off workers to keep confidential both the terms of their severance agreement and the terms and conditions of their job (which includes wages, hours, health and safety issues, etc.). But your employer may still require that you not reveal trade secrets or other confidential information that protects their business interests, Herman noted. And employers may still ask you to waive your right to make any future claims or file a lawsuit against them. 5. How will this new ruling affect employers’ future severance decisions? It’s easy to forget, but there is no legal requirement for employers to offer laid off workers severance. But they do so for several reasons beyond just maintaining goodwill with employees and the surrounding community, which may rely economically on the business’ workforce. They offer severance to buy protection from things like being sued or publicly disparaged, from having their trade secrets revealed or otherwise having claims brought against them. “I’m doing it because I want to get something from the employee in return. I’m buying finality [in having to deal with that employee],” said Jon Hyman, a management-side attorney and chair of the employment and labor practice at Wickens Herzer Panza. But by no longer being able to require that an employee stay quiet about the terms and conditions of their job or what’s in their severance agreement, the amount of protection an employer can buy is reduced. So employers may want to pay less for it, Hyman suggested. “There’s a real risk to employees that the case will have a negative impact on the size of severance packages going forward,” he said.

      401(k) balances rise, despite economic and market challenges
    ","Despite higher prices, endless talk of a possible recession and falling markets, 401(k) participants managed to keep their savings rates relatively steady in the fourth quarter of last year, helping to stabilize their nest eggs and increase their overall average balances. That’s according to new data from Fidelity Investments, one of the largest providers of workplace retirement plans, which combined represent $2.8 trillion in assets on its platform. “Fortunately, the data show that retirement savers understand the importance of saving for the long-term, despite market shift. We are encouraged to see people look past the current volatility and continue to make smart choices for their future,” said Kevin Barry, president of Workplace Investing at Fidelity. By that Barry means the average 401(k) savings rate (including both employee contributions and employer matches) held roughly steady at 13.7%, down from the 13.8% in the third quarter and 13.9% in the second quarter. Among generations in the workforce, Baby Boomers had the highest savings rate as a percent of their income (16.5%). The youngest cohort – Gen Z workers – saved 10.2%. A third of participants actually increased their contribution rate over the last year, according to Fidelity. But the average rate among this group is still very low – at just 2.6%. The average 401(k) balance in Fidelity-administered plans, meanwhile, rose 7% from the third quarter, to $103,900. That said, thanks to poor performances in both stocks and bonds last year, the average is still 23% below the $135,600 recorded at the end of 2021. In terms of 401(k) loans, the percent of active plan participants with outstanding ones remained at 16.7%. That’s down from 17% a year earlier and 21% from five years ago, Fidelity said. The average outstanding loan amount was $10,200. Among different age groups, Gen Xers had the highest average, followed by Baby Boomers. And even though they are just getting started in their careers and haven’t had a lot of time to amass savings, 3.2% of Gen Z workers also had outstanding 401(k) loans, but their average amount ($3,000) was the lowest among all age groups. Hardship withdrawals from 401(k)s – money taken when a participant is under financial stress of some kind (e.g., to prevent eviction, pay for funeral expenses or to cover a near-term tuition bill) – stood at 2.4% for the year, up from 1.9% in 2021. The average amount taken out was $2,200. Unlike a 401(k) loan, a hardship withdrawal does not need to be paid back, and will be taxed. Plus, in some instances it may be subject to a 10% penalty if you’re under 59-1/2. The new retirement law, Secure 2.0, includes a provision that will make it easier and less costly for 401(k) participants to take money out of their account for emergency needs up to $1,000 in a year. Apart from its workplace retirement plans, Fidelity reported a 10.2% annual increase in the number of IRAs on its platform, noting that 61% of the IRA contributions made in the fourth quarter of last year went into Roth IRAs.

      Companies can no longer silence laid-off employees in exchange for severance
    ","If your company lays you off, your employer might offer you severance pay — but only if you agree to adhere to a number of restrictions. Staying quiet is often one of them. But the National Labor Relations Board this week put employers on notice that they can no longer silence laid-off employees in two very specific ways that the board says violates employees’ rights under sections 7 and 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act. Employers can no longer include a broadly written confidentiality clause that requires you to keep mum about the terms of your severance agreement. And they can no longer include a broadly written non-disparagement clause that prohibits you from discussing the terms and conditions of your employment with third parties. “A severance agreement is unlawful if it precludes an employee from assisting coworkers with workplace issues concerning their employer, and from communicating with others, including a union, and the Board, about his employment,” the board wrote in its decision Tuesday. The ruling is a reversal of what the Trump-era NLRB members had decided in a prior case were lawful restrictions on employees as a condition of receiving severance. With the exception of railroads and airlines, US business employers are subject to the NLRB’s authority. While the labor board’s ruling this week could be appealed, the ruling is effective immediately. That means employers must review — and, if necessary, revise — their severance agreements to ensure they don’t include overly broad language that would restrict workers’ rights in the two ways the board ruling indicates. The board’s decision will give back a bit of power to employees, but how it plays out remains to be seen. “Companies are definitely incentivized to silence their departing employees…[because it helps them keep] all the skeletons in the closet,” employment attorney Alex Granovsky told CNN via email. “This decision opens the door. While on the one hand sunlight is the best medicine, and greater exposure should lead to better companies, this decision could also change the dynamics of a severance negotiation.” – CNN’s Chris Isidore contribute to this report ",349,success,2023-02-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/22/success/severance-agreements-rule-change-from-nlrb/index.html

      Getting laid off? Know your rights
    ","The abrupt and unceremonious way that thousands of Twitter employees got laid off last week was a spectacle. But it was also a helpful reminder that while employers can get rid of many workers at will (and with zero graciousness), employees are not without rights when they are laid off en masse. Here’s a quick primer on what employees need to know. For a plant closing or a mass layoff, you should get at least 60 days notice, under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Some states may require more notice – New York, for instance, requires 90 days. And states also may set stricter standards than the federal law, such as requiring employers with fewer workers to comply with the WARN Act. If an employer is found to have violated the WARN Act, in addition to paying penalties to the state, it will be required to pay out up to 60 days (or more, depending on the state requirement) of back wages and benefits to those laid off, depending on how many days’ notice the company actually gave. “Notice” in this instance means notifying the community at large but also each individual who will be laid off, said employment attorney Michael DuPont, who is managing shareholder at the Minnesota-based law firm Wagner, Falconer & Judd and also provides legal services through LegalShield. If a company lays you off abruptly, it may be found to have complied with the WARN Act so long as the effective date of your layoff is at least 60 days after the day you got notice that you’re being let go, said employment attorney Alex Granovsky, cofounder of the New York-based law firm Granovsky & Sundaresh. Technically you will remain on the company’s payroll and will continue to receive pay and benefits in the interim, and then any severance you’re given would kick in. Un-fun fact: No law – federal or state – requires employers to offer you any severance when they lay you off, unless you have a union or individual employment contract that includes a provision for it. That said, many employers do offer some form of severance to protect themselves from any potential legal claims you might bring as a result of your employment or termination. A second reason many offer severance: “Good will and fairness to the employees and to the community as a whole. To offer additional compensation in recognition of the potentially tough time the employee and community would [experience],” DuPont said. An employer will want you to waive certain rights in exchange for money. Put bluntly, “the company covers itself in every way a former employee can hurt [it],” Granovsky said. Generally speaking you will waive your right to bring a claim against the company, such as discrimination, hostile work environment, pay violations or any other alleged wrongdoing. You also typically will need to agree to several clauses that prohibit you from harming the company, he said. They include: A confidentiality clause: This clause prohibits you from sharing details of the company’s business or even the terms of your severance agreement. A non-disparagement clause: This prohibits you from badmouthing the place. A cooperation clause: You agree to assist the company if it gets sued in the future over a matter that you know something about as a result of your tenure there. A non-cooperation clause: This prohibits you from helping anyone else trying to sue the company. A non-solicitation clause: This typically means you can’t poach your soon-to-be former employer’s clients or employees should you start working elsewhere or launch your own business. Waiving these types of rights does not, however, excuse the employer from having to pay you what is already owed, such as a pension or earned vacation or sick leave. “The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue … must be something of value in addition to any of the employee’s existing entitlements,” the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notes. If you think you have legitimate claims against the company, your employer would almost certainly rather you not sue, so it will likely be more open to negotiating the terms of your severance instead. “A company would rather pay $100 now to avoid having to pay $150 later,” DuPont said. If you don’t have a strong case that could justify filing a lawsuit, which you could use as a bargaining chip, you can still try to make the case for why your employer might sweeten your severance package. “Asking is fine. You should ask. There’s no harm in asking,” Granovsky said. You might ask for more months of paid health benefits if you or a family member on your insurance plan is battling cancer, DuPont noted as an example. Or if you’re a long-term employee in good standing or you have a special skill set that the employer might want to tap in the future, you might make a compelling case for why the company should offer you some additional pay. Since a severance agreement is an important legal document that will affect your immediate future, it can be helpful to have an employment lawyer with experience in severance cases review the company’s offer. If hiring a lawyer directly is too expensive, you might consider a less expensive service like LegalShield, which only charges about $30 a month to gain access to an employment attorney in your state who can review your offer, make sure it complies with the law and make a call on your behalf to your employer if you’re seeking modifications to the agreement. If your case is complicated and involves further legal action, or if your severance agreement is more than 15 pages long, your costs will be higher, but you will get a discount on the hourly fees of the lawyer on your case. Or, if you just have some very simple questions, some employment lawyers might offer a free consultation by phone. Under federal laws, if you’re 40 or older, you must be given at least 45 days in a group termination (21 days if your layoff is not part of a mass layoff) to decide whether to sign your severance agreement. In either case, if you accept the offer you also must be given a 7-day period afterward to change your mind. That said, each state may have its own requirements above the federal minimum requirements, DuPont said. So check your state’s Department of Labor site to see what its specific requirements are. Many employers may stop your severance payments if the company rehires you for a new position. If you find a job elsewhere or start freelancing for others, some employers may choose to reduce your severance payments if your new source of income is less than what you used to be paid. “They may say, ‘If you make less money we’ll only pay the delta,’” Granovsky said. In either case, your severance agreement should state explicitly what the employer’s policy is. So don’t sign it until you’re clear about those terms. But if the agreement is silent on the issue then you likely may continue to receive your full severance while also earning income from another source. “So that’s a win for the employee,” DuPont said.

      Black couples pay a higher tax penalty for marriage than White couples. Here’s why
    ","When filling out your federal income tax return, there is no requirement to identify your race. Moreover, the US tax code does not contain specific racial group provisions. Yet just because the tax code is considered race blind does not mean it’s race neutral. A recent study by the Tax Policy Center, for example, found that Black couples on average face higher tax costs associated with marriage than White couples. It is part of a growing body of research that shows the tax code can create or reinforce economic disparities between Black households and White households. The research is providing empirical evidence for the seminal work done by legal scholars Dorothy Brown, Beverly Moran and William Whitford, which raised the likelihood of racial inequities in the tax code. Generally speaking, when US tax filers of any race get married, they can get hit with either a “marriage penalty” or a “marriage bonus,” meaning they pay more or less in taxes as a married couple than they would as two singles. Penalties are more likely when both spouses in a couple work than among one-earner couples. And they are higher when two spouses each make about the same amount of money. Penalties are also more likely when a couple has children. If the financial facts of a Black married couple were identical to those of a White married couple, there would be no difference in their tax burdens, said William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center and a coauthor of its marriage study. But the economic facts of Blacks and Whites on average are different. For example, Black married couples are more likely to live in a two-earner household; each spouse is more likely to earn about the same amount as the other; and they are more likely to have dependents. “We find that Black couples are more likely than White couples to experience an income tax penalty from marriage and to face higher penalties. We show that these patterns arise because, controlling for income, Black spouses have more equal earnings than white spouses … and because Black couples are more likely to have dependents,” the authors of the report write. Researchers found that among couples hit with a marriage penalty, Black couples paid less in dollars ($1,804 versus $2,091) but more as a share of their income than White couples (1.8% versus 1.4%). When researchers specifically focused on households with adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $100,000 under the tax law in effect for 2018, they found 59% of Black couples faced a marriage penalty versus 51% of White couples. Black couples paid about $150 more on average. Only 33% of Black couples got a marriage bonus compared to 44% of Whites, and those bonuses were roughly $170 smaller on average. “Taken together, Black couples in this income group paid, on average, a net penalty of $358. White couples in this income group received, on average, a net bonus of $61,” the report noted. The researchers found a similar pattern among most other income groups. The TPC study comes after the US Treasury released details on how to impute race and ethnicity on to tax data — an effort made in response to an executive order from President Joe Biden directing government agencies to better measure and advance racial equity. However, there is “no easy solution to the racial disparities in the tax treatment of marriage in a tax code that doesn’t explicitly refer to race,” the TPC authors noted in a blog post. One option might be to let married couples file as unmarried individuals, they said — although that would “make the tax code less progressive and open new opportunities for tax avoidance.” It’s still early days when it comes to detailing how tax and other federal policies affect racial equity and how differences can be cured, said Gale. “We’re maybe in the second inning. There is so much work to be done.” ",656,success,2023-02-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/20/success/taxes-racial-inequity-married-couples/index.html

      How long should you support your adult children? Parents — and their kids — weigh in
    ","Parents invest so much of themselves, emotionally and financially, in raising their children — but the time comes when a parent has to stop subsidizing their adult children’s everyday expenses. Think housing, health insurance, car payments, cell phones, credit cards, subscription services, student loans and travel. And, as it turns out, kids and parents don’t agree on just when exactly that time should be. A new survey from Bankrate found that Gen Z adults (between the ages of 18 and 26) think parents should slow their roll on when to stop paying for them. Take housing. Gen Z adults said they shouldn’t have to start paying rent until age 23 on average. Baby Boomer and Gen X parents beg to differ, saying their kids should pony up starting at age 21. When it comes to cell phones and credit card bills, Gen Z thinks they should start paying for them by age 21. Their parents say age 19 would be better. The Bankrate survey doesn’t specify how many respondents are living with their parents or, conversely, their adult children. But it’s a fair bet the percentage could be significant. In July 2022, the Pew Research Center found that half of adults ages 18 to 29 were living with at least one parent. Of course, how a parent feels about the need for their child to pay their own bills and what a parent does may be two very different things. Nearly 7 in 10 parents with children 18 or older said they have made a financial sacrifice to help their grown-up kids, according to the survey. Thirty-one percent characterized that sacrifice as “significant,” while 37% said it was “somewhat significant.” Sacrifice meant: Reducing their emergency savings (51%), impairing their ability to pay off their own debt (49%) or save for retirement (43%); and making it hard to reach some other financial milestone (55%). Low-income parents — defined as those making $50,000 or less a year — were most likely to say they have made financial sacrifices to help their adult children. For instance, 58% of the lowest earners said they sacrificed their emergency savings compared to 46% of the highest earning households — defined as earning $100,000 or more a year. While it can be hard to say no to your adult offspring if they ask for, or simply expect, a financial assist, parents do themselves no favors if they subsidize them at the expense of their own financial security. After all, not everyone is likely to backstop a parent who falls behind on housing payments, fails to create a sufficient financial cushion for retirement or who finds they can’t afford medical care. “Make sure the assistance [you give] works within your budget and be clear about the parameters,” said Ted Rossman, a senior analyst at Bankrate. “Helping out shouldn’t be seen as a blank check or an indefinite handout. It might help to attach a specific dollar amount or time frame.” Bankrate’s survey, conducted from March 14 to March 16, included responses from a nationally representative sampling of 2,346 US adults, of whom 773 were parents with children age 18 or older.

      The latest on hybrid work: Who is WFH and who isn’t
    ","As the economy slows, are employers starting to regain the upper hand in negotiations with employees and job seekers? Pay is always an issue, of course, but in the wake of the pandemic, so too is how much time employers want people to work on site versus how much they are willing to let employees work remotely. Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that only 27.5% of private-sector businesses reported that their employees worked from home or another remote location some or all of the time between August 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022. In other words, 72.5% of private-sector organizations — up from 60% in the July-to-September 2021 period — said they did not have employees working remotely. That percentage struck work-from-home researchers and observers as surprisingly high, given what other studies and surveys have found. (More on those in a minute.) Private sector businesses employ a majority of US workers and, according to the Pew Research Center, 61% of workers do not have jobs that can be done remotely. But it’s worth noting that the BLS findings did not measure teleworking arrangements at federal, state and local government employers, at nonprofit organizations or among the self-employed. The BLS survey also interpreted respondents’ answers as referring to a company’s formal telework policies, not whether some employees informally work remotely on occasion, such as responding to work emails from home. “To the extent that ‘work from home’ would include an individual who checks their email after hours, we purposefully did not want to capture that type of informal work activity in the estimates as this would likely be included in the ‘rarely or never’ category,” a BLS spokesperson said in an email to CNN. Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom said he finds it hard to infer much from the BLS’s 72.5% finding, because he contends respondents must have misread the survey’s very first question, which said, “Do any employees at this location currently telework in any amount?” In his view, “any amount” includes answering work emails or taking a work call from home. Semantic concerns aside, however, the confusion and surprise over the BLS finding is a reminder that there is still no standard or easy way to measure the full extent of remote work in a post-pandemic world. Other surveys and studies of people who work for all employers — not just those in the private sector — suggest telework for those whose jobs can be done remotely remains common in this post-pandemic period. The Pew Research Center, for instance, found in a nationally representative survey of US full-time working adults conducted in February that 41% of workers with jobs that can be done from home are now working a hybrid schedule. That is up from 35% in January of last year. Among hybrid workers who are not self-employed, 63% said their employer requires them to come into the workplace with some regularity; 59% say they typically work from home three or more days a week. That suggests the push by top employers — such as Disney, Amazon, Apple, as well as several Wall Street banks — to get employees back into the office three or more days a week may not have moved the needle much. Meanwhile, Kastle Systems, which operates card-swipe security machines in office buildings across the United States, said that the weekly average office occupancy rate at the end of March in the most populous U.S. cities was 49% of pre-pandemic levels. While that’s much higher than the occupancy rates recorded during the height of the pandemic, it’s still a very long way from occupancy rates recorded back in February 2020 just before the pandemic hit. The latest results from the monthly Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA), which Bloom and other researchers have conducted since May 2020, found that the overall average number of paid days worked from home in 2023 so far is 1.4 per week (or 28% of the workweek). That’s based on responses from Americans aged 20 to 64 who earned $10,000 or more the prior year. The same survey respondents said their employers plan to allow employees to work remotely 2.2 days a week, for those who can. That’s up from the 1.6 days expected back in August 2020, although below the expected 2.4 days recorded in June 2022. SWAA found that working from home is most prevalent in cities and in sectors like technology and information, finance and insurance, and professional and business services. That is somewhat similar to the BLS finding that telework is most common in the following industries: information, professional and business services, educational services and wholesale trade. Remote work experts strongly assert hybrid schedules will remain a permanent feature of work in the United States for a host of reasons — including better worker engagement and retention — even if the parameters and kinks are still being worked out in real time. “Companies are still trying to figure it out,” said Sara Sutton, CEO of remote-work jobs platform FlexJobs, which she founded 16 years ago. But, Sutton added, “Hybrid is where things will settle.” When it comes to the overall average of how often employers are likely to let employees work from home, Bloom believes it will be 25% of the week. “I have talked to hundreds of organizations about WFH [working from home] over the past three weeks, and this is now clearly stabilizing to a post-pandemic norm,” he said in an email. Fully remote jobs, meanwhile, will remain but may become less prevalent than they have been of late. In Pew’s February survey, 35% of people who could work remotely were doing so full time, down from 55% in October 2020, but still well above the 7% of people working remotely full-time before the pandemic.

      Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time
    ","For most people in their early- to mid-20s, filing taxes is right up there with having to pay rent and realizing you can’t take summers off anymore: an unwelcome fact of being an adult. If you’re a recent graduate working your first full-time job or supporting yourself for the first time, this tax-filing season may indeed be your first experience doing your own taxes without the help of a parent. So here are seven things to keep in mind. If you’re confounded by filing your taxes, you may think it’s because you’re young and inexperienced. Nonsense. Tax filers of all ages get confused by tax rules and the intricacies of all the tax documents required. And it doesn’t help that tax provisions are tweaked frequently. Your tax return is a financial snapshot of your life over a 12-month period, in this case 2022. And a lot can happen during that time that will have tax implications and need to be reported. “Think about what went on in your life in the past year,” said Tom O’Saben, the director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Preparers. For example, O’Saben asked, did you work more than one job? Did you move for a new job? Did you get laid off? Did you get married or have a child? Did you make student loan payments? Did you make money selling anything you own? Did you buy a home? Next, pull together all necessary documentation. In addition to receipts and other paperwork you may have kept, you should also have tax forms that were either mailed to you or sent electronically — from your employers, brokerage firms, college, loan servicers, the state unemployment office, etc. You’ll need the information on these forms to fill out your tax return accurately. Keep in mind, the IRS also has a copy of these “third-party” forms that were sent to you, so its systems will flag if there is any discrepancy between what is on the form sent to you and what you put on your return. Most people realize what they earn at a full-time job is subject to income tax and that those taxes are automatically withheld by your employer. But any side hustle income you generate, or money you make as a gig worker, is also taxable, even if you’re paid in cash or via a payment app. Ditto for tips. And often tax on that type of income is not withheld. You’re just paid a gross amount and will have to set aside money to cover the taxes owed on it. Severance payments and unemployment benefits may be taxable too. And so is investment income — meaning the profits (or “capital gain”) you make on the sale of an investment or property — which is basically the price for which you sell something minus the original price you paid for it. (Also worth noting: if you have investment income, also called “passive” income, it is taxed at a lower rate than your paycheck — i.e., “earned” income — assuming you held your investment longer than a year.) Most dividends and interest payments are also taxable. And remember all that lucrative fun you had betting on the SuperBowl or spending a weekend with friends in Vegas? Yup, your winnings from gambling and sports betting are considered taxable income. (The semi-good news is if you had any gambling losses last year, they can offset your wins, so it may be that you won’t owe tax on your winnings if your losses cancel them out.) For many of these types of income you should have received forms from your employer (a W2 if you’re a full-time employee); from your clients if you’re a contract or gig worker (eg. a 1099-K, a 1099-NEC) or, starting next year, from the payment apps on which you get paid for your goods and services (e.g., a 1099-MISC). Meanwhile, banks and brokerage firms will send you 1099-INTs (for interest), 1099-DIVs (for dividends) and 1099-Bs (for your capital gains and losses). If you live in Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington or Wyoming, you don’t have to file a state tax return because those states don’t impose an income tax. If you live in New Hampshire and Tennessee, you won’t have to file a return for your salary and wages. But you may have to file a return if you got income from dividends and interest during the tax year. The standard deduction reduces your adjusted gross income. The amount for tax year 2022 is $12,950 for singles; $25,900 for married couples filing jointly; and $19,400 for heads of household (e.g., a single parent). “That’s the amount of money you don’t have to pay tax on,” O’Saben noted. The only filers who itemize their deductions are those whose deductions add up to more than the standard deduction. Itemized deductions include: charitable contributions, state and local income and property taxes, mortgage interest and casualty loss if you live in a federally declared disaster area. But even if you just take the standard deduction you may also take in addition what are called “above-the-line” deductions. These include up to $2,500 in student loan interest that you paid in 2022 (your student loan servicer should send you a Form 1098-E); any contributions you made to a deductible IRA or to a Health Savings Account; and, if you’re a teacher, up to $300 of what you spent on school supplies and personal protective equipment for your classroom. [For a fuller list of different types of taxable income (“additional income”) and above-the-line deductions (“adjustments to income”), see Schedule 1 to the federal 1040 form.] A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax bill and if it’s a “refundable” credit, which some are, it can actually increase your refund. Some credits to be aware of, especially if you’re not making a lot of income: The Earned Income Tax Credit: The EITC is intended to help low- and moderate-income workers (defined in 2022 as those with earned income under $59,187), and especially filers with children. The EITC is also available to earners without qualifying children and it’s worth $560 for 2022. Education credits: If you were in school last year, footed the costs and are not claimed as a dependent on anyone else’s tax return, you may be eligible for an American Opportunity Tax Credit or a Lifetime Learning Credit. To see if you qualify, here’s an IRS table comparing the eligibility requirements and the value of each of those credits. Also, check to see if your educational institution sent you a Form 1098-T, which you will need if you claim one of these credits. The Saver’s Credit: The Saver’s Credit is a federal match for lower-income earners’ retirement contributions for up to $2,000 a year. The Child Tax Credit: If you’re a parent you may claim a maximum child tax credit of $2,000 for each child through age 16 if your modified adjusted gross income is below $200,000 ($400,000 if filing jointly). Above those levels, the child tax credit starts to get reduced. And the portion of the credit treated as refundable — meaning it is paid to you even if you don’t owe any federal income tax — is capped at $1,500, and that is only available to those with earned income of at least $2,500. And if you paid for child care in 2022, you may be eligible to claim a dependent care credit. Your federal tax return is due on April 18. That is the day by which you must have filed your 2022 individual tax return and paid any remaining federal income taxes owed for last year. The only exceptions are for those who lived in federally declared disaster areas, in which case their deadlines are later. But anyone can apply for — and will automatically be granted — a six-month extension until October 16, 2023 to file their return if they submit Form 4868 by April 18. Note, though, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay if you still owe the IRS more in taxes for last year than you actually paid in 2022. So, unless you have good reason to believe you will receive a refund, get a ballpark estimate of what more you think you’ll owe the IRS and send in that check by April 18 if you file for an extension. Otherwise you could be hit with a late payment penalty. And that could be compounded by a failure-to-file penalty if you didn’t file on time or didn’t get an automatic filing extension.

      The average Wall Street bonus fell by 26% last year
    ","The average annual Wall Street bonus fell to $176,700 last year, a 26% drop from the previous year’s average of $240,400, according to estimates released Thursday by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. The 2022 bonus figure is more than twice the median annual income for US households. Rising interest rates, recession fears and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hurt Wall Street firms’ bottom line. That led to a steep drop in mergers and acquisitions last year and a dearth of initial public offerings, which ordinarily generate huge revenues for the banks handling those mega-transactions. Look no further than Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which both reported big drops in revenue and profit for the fourth quarter of last year. Both announced layoffs a few months ago. And each firm’s CEO saw his pay slashed. “A 26% decline brings the average bonus closer to what financial employees received prior to the pandemic,” DiNapoli said in a statement. All in, Wall Street firms had a $33.7 billion bonus pool for 2022, which is 21% smaller than the previous year’s record of $42.7 billion — and the largest drop since the Great Recession. Nevertheless, an average bonus payout of $176,700 is nothing to sneeze at, considering the most recent Census figure for median US household income was $70,800 in 2021. For New York City and New York State coffers, bonus season means a welcome infusion of revenue, since employees in the securities industry make up 5% of private sector employees in NYC and their pay accounts for 22% of the city’s private sector wages. In 2021, Wall Street was estimated to be responsible for 16% of all economic activity in the city. DiNapoli’s office projects the lower bonuses will bring in $457 million less in state income tax revenue and $208 million less for the city compared to the year before. But bonus-driven revenue is not all that’s needed for the local economy to recover to pre-pandemic levels. “While lower bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, our economic recovery does not depend solely on Wall Street. Employment in leisure and hospitality, retail, restaurants and construction must continue to improve for the city and state to fully recover,” DiNapoli said.

      Erling Haaland’s outrageous goal shatters more records and draws comparisons to Messi and Ronaldo
    ","Each year, the English Premier League emerges like a complicated piece of music – filled with interdependent independent rhythms and melodies weaving in and out of each other. And this season, Erling Haaland has provided a counterpoint to the traditional rhythms of the league, scoring goals with metronomic consistency, but like a metronome bent out of shape, setting a new pace for everyone else to follow. His two goals on Saturday broke more scoring records and guided Manchester City to a 4-1 victory over Southampton to keep the pressure on league leader Arsenal in the title race. Haaland’s second goal, an outrageous bicycle kick after latching onto Jack Grealish’s cross, took his total to 30 goals scored in the Premier League this season, a haul the 22-year-old has reached in just 27 games and faster than anyone else. Already, the Norwegian has equaled the record of 44 goals scored by a Premier League player in all competitions in one season. With a maximum of 16 games remaining – depending on City’s fortunes in the knockout stages of the FA Cup and Champions League – it is surely a question of when and by how much Haaland will break this particular record. As for the Premier League goal-scoring record itself, Haaland is just four shy of the outright record held jointly by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer, but which was set when there were 42 games in a season, in 1993-94 and 1994-95 respectively. Mohamed Salah holds the record for the most goals scored in a 38-game season, with his 32 goals in 2017-18. “We have lived two incredible decades with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, but he is on that level,” City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport. “The second goal was amazing. It is not easy to pick the ball up in the sky and put it on the grass.” Guardiola added that Haaland, still at the beginning of his career, had some way to go before he could assume the same stature as Messi and Ronaldo. “He is so competitive but to reach the Cristano and Messi levels is a lot of work,” Guardiola said, according to Sky Sports. “They don’t get injured. Erling is tall, he’s huge, he needs a lot of care, physios, not just one but a lot of people.” As one component of a City side stacked with creative talent, Haaland’s prolific goal scoring is likely to continue. As Shearer wrote in The Athletic: “He’s a goal machine, someone who is quick and direct, who is physically strong and good in the air, who can score with both feet and whose positioning is fantastic.” ",440,football,2023-04-09,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/09/football/erling-haaland-records-southampton-manchester-city-spt-intl/index.html

      Safe from the sack for now, Jurgen Klopp looks to revive Liverpool with win over title-chasing Arsenal
    ","It’s fair to say that most Liverpool fans will be looking forward to seeing the back of this season. After an energy-sapping quadruple chase last term, Jurgen Klopp’s team appears to have run out of steam and ideas as it languishes in eighth place in the Premier League and has been soundly eliminated from all three cup competitions. Now 13 points off the top four, even Champions League football next season is looking like an increasingly unlikely prospect, as the team has gone winless in its three league matches – four in total, including defeat to Real Madrid – since that 7-0 drubbing of Manchester United. In a league that has often been all too happy to sack managers at the first sign of trouble, it’s notable that Liverpool’s owners have so far kept faith and look likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. But after a Premier League record 12 sackings this season – Leicester City’s Brendan Rodgers and Graham Potter of Chelsea being the latest victims – even Klopp joked about his job being under threat. “The elephant in the room is probably why am I still sitting here in this crazy world? Last man standing,” the German told reporters earlier in the week. Despite this season’s struggles, however, you would be hard pressed to find a Liverpool supporter in favor of dismissing Klopp. The 55-year-old has turned the club around in remarkable fashion since arriving eight years ago, taking the team from mid-table to the summit of English and European football. It is precisely this success, obtained with a thrilling brand of football to boot, that has earned Klopp enough brownie points with fans and the club’s owners to be awarded time to fix the current situation. But while his job is safe for now, even the most patient of owners have their limits. It’s likely Liverpool will have to show some improvements between now and the end of the season to prove Klopp can coach the team out of this slump, something he was unable to do in his final months in charge of Borussia Dortmund. Up next on this brutal stretch of fixtures is Arsenal, a team that been what Liverpool aspired to be in the league this season. The Gunners’ success, achieved with an entertaining style of play, was something Klopp was quick to praise ahead of Sunday’s clash. “Mikel is building this team for a few years now and obviously the outcome is pretty impressive,” Klopp told reporters on Friday, per LFC.com. “The way they play is fun to watch, to be honest, it’s super-lively, really good football, top players on the pitch, good match plans. “It’s not exactly what you can say about us in the moment, so that shows you what the situation is. But at least for a while we can mention, again, it’s Anfield. “So, we are at home and still have to show reaction after reaction after reaction – we have to – and improvement. That’s what we will absolutely try on Sunday.” Klopp said building on the “good moments” Liverpool had recently enjoyed in games – even if they have been few and far between – will be key to earning a result, but will be easier said than done against an Arsenal team that has a first Premier League crown in 19 years in its sights. However, Arsenal has struggled badly at Anfield in recent years, losing seven, drawing two and winning just one of its previous 10 matches in Liverpool’s back yard. Arsenal’s last win at Anfield came in 2012, a game Arteta started, but the Gunners boss is confident his team has the ability to snap that poor run of form at Anfield. “We’ve been to a few grounds this season where we haven’t won in 17, 18 and 22 years and we have managed to do that,” he told reporters, per Arsenal.com. “So we are capable of [winning at Anfield], that’s for sure. “We really need to embrace the moment and go for it. The team is full of enthusiasm and positivity and we know that we have a big challenge, but I see a big opportunity to go to Anfield and do something that we haven’t done for many years. That’s what is driving the team in the last few days. “It’s very, very difficult, so we know that, and the opportunity is ahead of us there on Sunday to do something that we have done in the last two or three years, to win in places that the team didn’t do for many, many years.” ",766,football,2023-04-09,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/09/football/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html

      Ajax star Davy Klaassen injured after being struck by object thrown from crowd
    ","Ajax midfielder Davy Klaassen suffered a head injury after being hit by an object thrown from the crowd during his team’s 2-1 win over Feyenoord on Wednesday. The 30-year-old had put his side ahead in the second half but was struck by an object after he had tried to calm down an altercation between both sets of players. Blood could be seen on the back of Klaassen’s head and the game was temporarily suspended for almost 30 minutes as both sets of players left the pitch at the Feyenoord’s De Kuip stadium. Before the game restarted, Feyenoord’s assistant coach John de Wolf addressed the crowd via the public address system. “Use your common sense,” he told fans, according to Reuters. Shortly after the restart, Klaassen was substituted, appearing to suffer from dizziness. “I had a throbbing feeling around the wound and I also had trouble focusing, so I could have stayed on the pitch but that wasn’t going to help me nor the team,” Klaassen told the club website, adding that he was initially angry after being hit. “It was hard [to leave the pitch.] You don’t want to let it get to you, but sometimes, you have to put your pride aside.” Rotterdam Police later confirmed that a 32-year-old man was arrested. “What happened tonight, you do not want to see on a football pitch,” Feyenoord’s manager Arne Slot told the club website after the match. “90% of our fans always support us in a positive way, but what happened tonight doesn’t help us, the opposite actually. It’s terrible” CNN has reached out to Ajax and Feyenoord for further comment on the incident. CNN has also reached out to the Dutch FA for comment on any possible sanctions. Ajax’s win secured its place in the Dutch Cup final where it will face PSV on April 30.

      Some fans whistle as Lionel Messi’s name is announced as Paris Saint-Germain’s season hits new low
    ","Paris Saint-Germain’s miserable season went from bad to worse on Sunday as the team suffered a second straight home defeat with a 1-0 loss to Lyon. Even before the game kicked off, Lionel Messi bore the brunt of the frustrations of some PSG fans who whistled when his name appeared on the big screen during the announcement of the starting lineup. After Alexadre Lacazette missed a first-half penalty, Bradley Barcola’s goal 10 minutes into the second period was enough to earn Lyon the three points on a night that PSG rarely looked like threatening the visiting goal. Lens’ 1-0 victory over Rennes and Marseille’s 1-1 draw with Montepellier means both teams are now just six points behind PSG at the top of Ligue 1, and even the domestic title may slip from the team’s grasp. The reaction of some fans on Sunday must have felt a world away from the adulation and worship Messi received during his recent return to Argentina for friendlies against Panama and Curaçao as the country continued its World Cup celebrations. Messi’s arrival at the Parc des Princes was supposed to be the missing piece that would help PSG finally win the Champions League, the trophy the club’s Qatari owners crave the most. So far, the only major trophy the team has won since Messi joined was Ligue 1 last season, a title – it’s fair to say – PSG would likely have won without him. Messi has 34 goal contributions in all competitions for PSG this season – 18 goals and 17 assists – second only to Mbappé’s 38 and head coach Christophe Galtier refused to lay the blame for the team’s failures at the Argentine’s feet. “I found it [the jeering] hard to listen to,” Galtier told reporters, per the Athletic. “There may be expectations for Messi and Mbappe to unlock difficult situations. Messi tries very hard, they didn’t all work out; but around him, the other players also need to do their jobs.” “We can’t expect everything from Leo and Kylian,” he added. Up next for PSG is a season-defining week as Galtier’s side travels to a Nice team that is unbeaten in 13 matches, before hosting Lens at the Parc des Princes. PSG has lost two of its three matches since being dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich last month, and only limped past relegation-threatened Brest with a 90th minute Kylian Mbappé winner. After his team’s victory, Lyon head coach Laurent Blanc said the Champions League or bust mentality has been detrimental to PSG’s performances. “Paris’ problem is when the No. 1 objective of the Champions League is no longer accessible, it seems that the season no longer exists – and at all levels,” he told reporters.

      Police investigating reports of Liverpool bus attack after Manchester City match
    ","Greater Manchester Police (GMP) is investigating reports that Liverpool’s team bus was damaged after the club’s English Premier League match against Manchester City, the police force said in a statement. The incident is reported to have taken place close to the Etihad Stadium, where the match was held, on Saturday afternoon, GMP said. “There were no reports of any injuries and the Liverpool Club coaches were able to continue with their journey. An investigation has now been launched by Greater Manchester Police to identify and locate the offenders,” read the statement sent to CNN. Manchester City, who won the tie 4-1 to keep alive its hopes of winning a third successive league title, described the incident as “totally unacceptable” and said it would “fully support” the investigation. “We understand an object was thrown towards the coach in a residential area,” the statement said. “Incidents of this kind are totally unacceptable, and we strongly condemn the actions of the individual(s) responsible.” Manchester City also addressed the chanting aimed at Liverpool fans during the game. Some British media outlets reported that the chanting made reference to the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster which caused 97 Liverpool fans to lose their lives. “We regret any offence these chants may have caused and will continue to work with supporter groups and officials from both clubs to eradicate hateful chanting from this fixture,” City said. Liverpool has not responded to CNN’s request for comment. In a statement to CNN, the Premier League said: “The Premier League condemns the chanting heard during today’s match between Manchester City and Liverpool. The League is treating the issue of tragedy chanting as a priority and as a matter of urgency.” The rivalry between the two English teams has increased in recent seasons as both have vied for the league title. Last season, City finished one point ahead of Liverpool in the title race. In 2018, UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, fined Liverpool after fans threw objects at City’s team bus ahead of a Champions League quarterfinal at Anfield. Last October, City manager Pep Guardiola said coins were thrown towards him during a league game between the two teams, and after the same match Liverpool condemned the “vile chants relating to football stadium tragedies” heard in the away end of the stadium, adding that offensive graffiti was also found in the away section. Fans singing songs about stadium disasters or fatal accidents, which has been described as ‘tragedy chanting,’ has been put in the spotlight in England this season. Ahead of Manchester United’s league match against Liverpool last month, the respective managers of both clubs called for an end to such chanting in a joint statement. The Football Association, English football’s governing body, said it strongly condemned such chants. In a statement to CNN, a FA spokesperson said: “We are very concerned about the rise of abhorrent chants in stadiums that are related to the Hillsborough disaster and other football related tragedies. “These chants are highly offensive and are deeply upsetting for the families, friends and communities who have been impacted by these devastating events, and we strongly condemn this behaviour. “We support clubs and fans who try to stamp out this behaviour from our game. We also support the excellent work of the survivor groups who engage with stakeholders across football to help educate people about the damaging and lasting effects that these terrible chants can have.” ",567,football,2023-04-02,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/football/liverpool-team-bus-manchester-city-spt-intl/index.html

      Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes rewards fan who messaged him for 300 days
    ","Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes knows that in sport persistence is the key to success and the Portuguese surprised a fan who messaged the midfielder for 300 consecutive days by promising him a signed shirt on a video call. “I saw you tweet (me for) around 280 days and said to myself that if he (reaches) 300 days then I will send him a shirt!” Fernandes said on Twitter in February, quoting the fan’s request for the number 300 for his signed jersey. But a month and a half later the Portugal international went even further and decided to present the fan with the shirt he would gift him on a video call. “I appreciate all the support you’ve been giving me, obviously for the club too, and that’s why I want to give you my shirt,” Fernandes said in a video posted to his social media channels. “I can’t even express the feeling, Bruno, I’m so happy,” said the surprised supporter after answering the call. The shocked fan may soon be wearing the shirt to a game at Old Trafford which Fernandes has invited him to. “One day I’ll be there. I want to see you playing for us for many years to come, I should be able to witness you play there,” said the supporter.

      Wayne Rooney has doubts Arsenal can handle ‘pressure’ as he tips Manchester City to win Premier League title race
    ","Wayne Rooney’s life changed forever on October 19, 2002. Everton was drawing 1-1 against Premier League champion Arsenal, then on a mightily impressive 30-game unbeaten run in England’s top division. As the game ticked into the 90th minute, the teenage forward, who had been brought on as a substitute by manager David Moyes, controlled a pass from teammate Thomas Gravesen, took a couple of touches, and unleashed a shot that beat Arsenal and England goalkeeper David Seaman to win the match and awaken the soccer world to his talents. At the time Rooney was but five days away from signing a professional contract on his 17th birthday, “Remember the name! Wayne Rooney!” screamed commentator Clive Tyldesley, which turned out to be as accurate a line as Rooney’s shot. Rooney went on to win five Premier League titles and a Champions League crown with Manchester United, as well as becoming the club’s record goalscorer, an accolade he also held for the England national team, until Harry Kane overtook his tally in the recent Euro 2024 qualifying game against Italy. Fast forward to 2023 and life for the 37-year-old Rooney, who is D.C. United’s head coach, has come full circle. This July he will take charge of the MLS All-Star side in his current hometown of Washington D.C. against Arsenal. “I was frustrated, actually, because I was on the bench for that game. I wanted to start the game and I didn’t,” Rooney, who represented Everton either side of a magnificent 13-year career with Manchester United, recently told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell. “It felt a bit strange at first, but it was an incredible feeling to score for your boyhood club and your first Premier League goal, but also with it being the winning goal against Arsenal … best team in the country at the time. It was crazy but it’s certainly one of my highlights and best moments, and a goal which I’ll never forget.” Rooney played  for four-time MLS Cup winners D.C. United in 2018/19 – with a game-saving tackle and game-winning assist in the space of about 20 seconds against Orlando City perhaps as impressive as his greatest goals in the Premier League. Life on the touchline began in a dual player-manager role for lower league English club Derby County in 2020, which turned into a permanent managerial position, before his return to Washington D.C. last year. By the time Arsenal arrive stateside Mikel Arteta’s side could have secured it first Premier League title since 2004. “I’ve played in the All-Star Game on both sides, for Manchester United a few years back and then played for the All-Stars against Atletico Madrid,” Rooney notes. “And obviously with it being Arsenal, it makes me a bit more excited because it’s a challenge. It will be a tough game, but a game which we’ll set up to try and go and win.” While he’s based thousands of miles away, Rooney remains a keen follower of the Premier League and is enjoying the title race from afar, not least watching Manchester City’s star striker  Erling Haaland, who has already plundered 42 goals in his debut season in England. Rooney says the 22-year-old Norwegian phenom is “incredible …. a player I love watching … he’s going to break quite a few records, that’s for sure.” However, Rooney is of the opinion that the current Premier League leader might fall short in their quest to wrest the title away from City, even though he admits, “I hope Arsenal do win it.” “I think City will pip them to it,” Rooney concedes. “It’s going to be intriguing. I think because Arsenal have not been in this position for a long time, and it can be a lot of pressure to go with that. “Once you start getting into the last 10 games of the season that’s when the real pressure starts. And so I’m really interested to see if they can sustain what they’ve been doing all season.” Rooney is even more forthright in his views on Manchester United. Still without a league championship since Alex Ferguson stepped down as manager in 2013, a decade in the relative wilderness is arguably over thanks to the appointment of Dutchman Erik ten Hag, who has already secured silverware in his first season at Old Trafford – the League Cup – and looking likely to achieve qualification for the Champions League. A serious challenge on the Premier League title would not be a surprise next season, and Rooney isn’t the first person to link Ten Hag’s decisiveness in the way he handled Cristiano Ronaldo with an uptick in results. “I suppose he got what he wanted,” says Rooney about the manner in which the Portuguese superstar left Manchester United by mutual consent last November, just a week after giving an explosive TV interview detailing his frustrations at the club. “For Manchester United, it was important to move on as quick as possible from that and really refocus on the group of players who were there and wanted to be there. And I think that’s where Ten Hag has done a really good job in refocusing the players and getting them in a position where they are, obviously, comfortably in the top four, and also winning the [League] Cup.” But did this diminish Ronaldo’s status as a legend at the club in any way? “No, I think what he’s done for Manchester United is great,” Rooney responds. “And he’s won Premier League titles, won the Champions League, scored many goals. “So I think certainly for the fans and certainly for the players, his former teammates who played with him from my time especially, we’ll never forget what he did for Manchester United. Because in my eyes, he’ll always be a club legend and it’s a shame the way it ended of course this time round. But I don’t think that takes anything away from his legacy at the club.” Legends come and go, and although United’s main man up front – Marcus Rashford – isn’t in the same tier of megastar as Rooney or Ronaldo just yet, the 25-year-old’s revival this season for his club has been impressive. And Rooney is rooting for Rashford, who has notched 120 goals, to break his record of 253 for the Red Devils. “I think we’ve all known about Marcus, even before he was in the first team, coming through the academy. He’s a top player and he fell off a little bit over the last 18 months especially. And again, I think Ten Hag has come in and really simplified it for him,” Rooney states. “I’m not a player who sits on records and hopes no one breaks them. I hope he does it and the reasons why [with] him being a Manchester lad coming through the academy. “I think it’s a great story and it means he’s been very successful with the club and been there a long time and scored a lot of goals if he does do it. So I hope he does. I think he certainly has the ability and the capabilities to be able to do it. I’m sure, or I hope, sometime in the next few years I’ll be able to pass that mantle onto him.” ",1209,football,2023-03-30,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/football/wayne-rooney-mls-all-star-arsenal-spt-intl/index.html

      Las Vegas Grand Prix tickets sell out despite $2,000 seats
    ","Formula One is finally heading back to Sin City next November for its first race since the 1980s – but those wanting to catch sight of the hotly anticipated event had better have a serious chunk of change. Even a standing ticket at the night time spectacle, past the Las Vegas Strip’s famous landmarks, hotels and casinos, won’t come cheap, with three-day access coming in at a hefty price tag of $500. For those wanting the option of sitting down, a seat in one of the grandstands will set them back between $2,000-2,500 for three days. Despite the cost, those tickets have already sold out, but more packages will be released in the coming months, according to F1. Meanwhile, four days in VIP hospitality is advertised at $10,000, with potential fans encouraged to inquire about availability. Hotels have already started to advertise bookings for race week, with VIP room and ticket packages at Caesars Palace advertised from an average of $8,000 to $11,590 a night. Next year’s Vegas GP is the third US location on the scheduled calendar alongside Miami and Austin, marking F1’s continued expansion in the US. The popularity of the “Drive to Survive” Netflix series has been credited – including by the drivers – with growing the sport’s audience in the United States. “Most of us experience the effect it’s had on the sport. There’s certainly been a lot of growth and I honestly see that most in America,” McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo said in October 2021, while his teammate Lando Norris said: “I think it’s a cool thing. Coming to America, there are so many people who are now into Formula One just because of watching ‘Drive to Survive.’” Although Vegas hosted the Caesars Palace Grands Prix in 1981 and 1982, this will be the first time a race has been staged on the iconic Strip. This time, the 3.8-mile track will feature 14 turns and drivers are expected to reach top speeds of around 212 miles per hour (342 kilometers per hour) over the course of the 50-lap race.

      Joey Logano wins 2022 NASCAR Cup Series championship
    ","Joey Logano won the NASCAR Cup Series championship Sunday, claiming the trophy after 312 laps at the Phoenix Raceway in Avondale, Arizona. The win gives Logano his second career championship, the first coming in 2018 at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Las Vegas. Before his first win, Logano had been widely seen as an underdog. The 32-year-old Logano started Sunday on the pole in the No. 22 Team Penske Ford. Although 36 drivers started, just four – Ross Chastain, Chase Elliott, Christopher Bell and Logano – were eligible for the series title after a playoff whittled the field down from 16. Chastain finished third, Bell 10th and Elliott 28th. Ty Gibbs had been slated to drive the No. 23 car Sunday. Following the death of his father, Coy Gibbs, he was replaced by driver Daniel Hemric just hours before the race, with his 23XI Racing team citing “a family emergency” as the cause. Coy Gibbs was the co-owner of Joe Gibbs Racing and son of team patriarch Joe Gibbs. After the race, Logano gave his condolences to the Gibbs family and thanked his team for the season. “Boy, that was intense there at the end,” Logano said. “It’s all about championships. That’s what it’s all about. Worked so hard these last couple of weeks just trying to put ourselves in position.” With his son in his arms, Logano said there was never any doubt going into today’s race. “I knew all along that we were going to win the championship,” Logano said. “I told the guys that we were the favorite from Daytona and we truly believed it. That’s the difference. “Like I said, I had a good team with a bunch of confidence and we had all the reason in the world to be confident. I said I never been truly this ready for a championship race, and we did it, man.

      Italy’s Pecco Bagnaia takes historic MotoGP title for Ducati
    ","Francesco ‘Pecco’ Bagnaia fired his Ducati to an historic MotoGP title on Sunday, in front of 170,380 fans at the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia, Spain. He becomes the first Italian to win the premier class since the great Valentino Rossi in 2009, the first Ducati rider to take the crown since Casey Stoner in 2007, and the first Italian to clinch the title on an Italian bike since the legendary Giacomo Agostini, five decades ago in 1972. Just a few short months ago, such a victory looked more fantasy than possibility. Going into the summer break the Italian trailed Yamaha’s Fabio Quartararo by 91 points, but a series of disastrous showings by the 2021 champion and masterful wins by Bagnaia – seven in total across the season – saw the gap evaporate. Quartararo needed to win in Valencia and hope Bagnaia scored fewer than two points. The Yamaha rider launched into the race determined to fulfill his side of the bargain. A breathless first few laps saw he and Bagnaia locked together, exchanging places with close passes.  At one point the two bikes clashed, sending one of the Ducati’s aerodynamic wings spinning into the gravel. Bagnaia then settled into the pack behind his rival, who was struggling to follow the leaders.  Around him riders skittled out of the race, with Marc Marquez, Jack Miller and Johan Zarco among those sent sprawling. Suzuki’s Alex Rins eventually took the win. The Japanese factory announced a surprise withdrawal from MotoGP racing earlier this year, and as a last waltz this was as flawlessly executed as they could have wished. Rins, with pictures of his Suzuki teammates on his helmet and good luck messages from Suzuki fans adorning his team’s garage, crossed the line ahead of KTM’s Brad Binder and Ducati’s Jorge Martin. Quartararo slumped onto the tank of his Yamaha as he crossed the line in fourth.  Bagnaia’s ninth place was more than enough to make him champion. “It’s the best day of my life,” Bagnaia told MotoGP.com in Parc Fermé. “I was struggling a lot. My mission was to be in the top five, but I didn’t know why, after the first three or four laps I started to struggle very much with the front of the bike, it was impossible to control.  But then the most important thing is that we won, and we are the world champion and it’s a really great day, I’m very happy.” ",407,motorsport,2022-11-06,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/motorsport/pecco-bagnala-motogp-italy-spt-intl/index.html

    ","With the NASCAR Cup Series making its final stop of the 2022 season at Phoenix Raceway on Sunday, four drivers will compete to be crowned champion. The format is simple: whoever takes the checkered flag ahead of the others takes home the title. Here’s what to know about Sunday’s season finale in the desert. Although 36 drivers will start the race at 3 p.m. ET, just four are eligible for the series title after a playoff whittled the field down from 16: Phoenix Raceway has been a fixture on the Cup circuit since the 1980s yet did not host the season finale until 2020. The one-mile oval, with its distinct dogleg shape that bends its backstretch, underwent a renovation in 2018. The start-finish line was moved from one of its straightaways to the exit of one of its corners, giving drivers one more chance to dive in and make a winning pass. If Chastain or anyone else tries a last-lap move similar to Martinsville, expect a finish to the season like no other.

      ‘If I was two meters to the left, I would have been dead:’ Pierre Gasly and fellow F1 drivers furious after he passes recovery vehicle on track at high speed
    ","Formula One drivers and teams united in anger after Pierre Gasly drove past a recovery vehicle at high speed in heavy rain at the Japanese Grand Prix, with the Alpha Tauri driver saying he could have died. The Frenchman had pitted to replace a front wing damaged by debris from Carlos Sainz’s earlier crash and was trying to catch up with the rest of the field in the opening few laps when he passed the vehicle recovering Sainz’s car. Shortly afterwards, the race was stopped, and an almost two-hour delay followed while the rain eased. The incident evoked memories of Jules Bianchi’s crash on the same circuit eight years ago, when he suffered fatal head injuries after he hit a recovery tractor. “We lost Jules already,” Gasly told Sky Sports. “We all lost an amazing guy, an amazing driver, for the reasons that we know. Eight years ago, on the same track, in the same conditions, with a crane. “Obviously I got scared. Obviously if I would have lost the car in a similar way Carlos lost it the lap before – it doesn’t matter the speed, 200kph, 100 – I would have died, as simple as that. I don’t understand. “It’s disrespectful to Jules, disrespectful to his family. All of us are risking our lives out there. We are doing the best job in the world but what we are asking is to at least keep us safe, it’s already dangerous enough. “I’m just extremely grateful that I’m here and tonight I’m going to call my family and all my loved ones and the outcome is what it is. I passed two meters from that crane, and if I was two meters to the left I would have been dead.” Bianchi’s father, Philippe, echoed Gasly, writing on Instagram: “No respect for the life of the driver, no respect for Jules’ memory. Incredible.” Other drivers and teams also condemned the decision to allow a recovery vehicle onto the track. “Even behind Safety Car, we are going 100, 150kph and still at those speeds we see nothing,” Sainz told Sky Sports. “So if one driver decides to get a bit out of the racing line, has a small aquaplaning, hits a button on the steering wheel and gets a bit out of line and hits a tractor, it’s over, no?” The FIA, motorsport’s governing body, said it has launched “a thorough review of the events involving the deployment of recovery vehicles during the Japanese Grand Prix,” read a statement on its website, following feedback from the drivers. “This is part of the common practice of analysis of all race incidents to ensure continual improvements of processes and procedures.” Gasly later received a 20-second penalty and two penalty points for speeding under red flag conditions. “That’s the lowest point we’ve seen in the sport for years,” Red Bull driver Sergio Perez told Sky Sports. “What happened today just makes me so angry. I just hope ever in the sport we never get to see this situation ever again. “We saw what happened here a few years ago with our friend Jules and absolutely I don’t care about what was the reason for that. It should never happen again, ever in any category.” ",540,motorsport,2022-10-10,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/motorsport/pierre-gasly-japanese-grand-prix-spt-intl/index.html

      ‘Have I or have I not?’: Max Verstappen crowned world champion in chaotic circumstances at Japanese Grand Prix
    ","Max Verstappen was crowned Formula One world champion in bizarre circumstances following a dominant victory at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday. It had been a chaotic race, stalled by rain and then restarted, before the chaos continued afterwards with confusion reigning over whether Verstappen had defended his title. For much of the race, it seemed as if the Red Bull driver would be forced to wait until the next grand prix in Austin to secure the drivers’ title for the second time in his career as the race was red-flagged due to rain. When the race did begin again, it was much shortened, seemingly leaving less points available, and with Verstappen’s rival Charles Leclerc crossing the line in second, he seemed mathematically still in the title hunt. So when Verstappen finished, he initially only celebrated a race victory – his 12th of the season – and completed his first post-race interview accordingly. But Ferrari’s Leclerc had cut the final corner, under pressure from Verstappen’s teammate Sergio Perez, and incurred a five-second time penalty after the race finished, ending his title challenge. “Have I or have I not? I am hearing different things,” Verstappen said, after he was initially crowned world champion during a second post-race interview. It was confirmed again, and he sat down in front of a ‘World Champion’ banner in a throne room. “I feel a bit lonely,” he said. Still, the Red Bull driver was not entirely certain of his new status as a two-time world champion, even after the podium celebrations to mark his race victory, as the regulations stipulating the awarding of points in the rain caused confusion. “Am I the world champion?” Verstappen asked Jensen Button before his interview on the podium. According to the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, full points, rather than staggered points, could be awarded since the race was resumed after a rain delay, giving Verstappen a 113 point lead in the world championship with only 112 left to win on the track. The rain fell all afternoon in Suzuka, and spray streamed out the back of the cars when they started for the first time. Out front, Leclerc challenged Verstappen for pole into the first corner but the defending world champion held his line around the outside to remain in the lead. Behind them, Ferrari’s Sainz aquaplaned off the road, into the advertising boarding and out of the race, while Williams’ Alex Albon suffered a gearbox failure and was also forced to retire. Alpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly picked up debris from Sainz’s crash recovery truck and pitted for a new front wing. Catching up with the field, he drove past a recovery truck on the track, evoking memories of Jules Bianchi who died after his car hit a recovery truck on this track eight years ago, and prompting anger from drivers and teams alike. “No respect for the Life of the driver no respect for Jules memory incredible (sic),” Bianchi’s father Philippe said on Instagram. Gasly later received a 20-second penalty and two penalty points for speeding under red flag conditions. In a statement, the FIA said it had launched a “thorough review of the events.” Shortly afterwards, the race was stopped and an almost two-hour delay followed, waiting for the conditions to become safer amid pouring rain. When the race restarted behind a safety car to help clear the track of water, the sky was still overcast and each car trailed a plume of spray behind it. Several drivers pitted soon after the restart, swapping wet tires for intermediate tires. Verstappen was among them and once out of the pits, he weaved his way through the field with ease to take the lead again, opening up a four second lead over Leclerc, who initially looked comfortable in second, eight seconds ahead of Perez. Verstappen’s advantage only widened, reaching first 10 and then 15 seconds over Leclerc, whose attention turned to the car behind as Perez moved within striking distance of the Ferrari towards the end of the race. On the final corner, Leclerc eventually yielded to Perez’s pressure and locked up on the final chicane of the race, cutting the corner and picking up a five-second penalty that demoted him to third. Twenty-seven seconds up the road, Verstappen cruised to victory, further confirming his dominance in a season during which he has won 12 of the 18 races. He only needs one more victory from the remaining four more races to equal the record for most Grand Prix victories won in a single season – currently held by Michael Schumacher in 2004 and Sebastian Vettel in 2013.

      Lewis Hamilton plans to continue racing beyond end of current Mercedes deal
    ","Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton on Thursday said he did not plan on retiring from Formula One any time soon. The Briton, who races for Mercedes, signed a two-year contract with the Brackley-based team last year keeping him at the outfit until the end of 2023 at least. Speaking to reporters ahead of Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix, Hamilton said he would race beyond the end of that deal. “I plan on staying longer,” Hamilton said at the Suzuka circuit, adding he definitely wanted to remain with Mercedes in some role for life. “It’s just not set in stone how long.” Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff in an interview with Channel 4 that aired over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend said Hamilton, who turns 38 in January, had told him he could go on for another five years. Hamilton on Thursday said he hadn’t spoken to Wolff about his comments but that it was a possibility. “I’m feeling good,” said the Briton, who made his debut in 2007 with McLaren before moving to Mercedes at the end of 2012. “I love what I’m doing. “We have a lot of work to do, a lot to achieve still. So I’m not planning on going anywhere, any time soon.” Hamilton’s run of four successive titles came to an end last year when Red Bull rival Max Verstappen denied him an unprecedented eighth championship on the last lap of a controversial season finale. The 37-year-old hasn’t been in the hunt this year and is still searching for his first win to add to his record 103-victory career haul, with Mercedes having been caught out by the rule changes introduced this season. Hamilton, a vocal advocate of environmental causes, human rights, social justice, equality and diversity said his main motivation behind continuing would remain fighting for wins and championships. But he also wanted to carry on so he could continue to make the sport more inclusive. “There’s a lot of work that still needs to be done in this sport,” said Hamilton. “I can’t retire now because I’m only just embarking in helping shift and create a more open and inclusive environment here in this sport and I’ve got to stay to help that continue.” ",370,motorsport,2022-10-07,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/motorsport/lewis-hamilton-f1-future-spt-intl/index.html

      NASCAR driver Jordan Anderson suffers second-degree burns after ‘scariest moment of my racing career’
    ","NASCAR driver Jordan Anderson says he suffered second-degree burns to his face and body after his truck caught fire at the Camping World Truck Series race at Talladega Superspeedway on Saturday. The 31-year-old described it as the “scariest moment of my racing career” after his vehicle erupted into flames before coming to a halt against the inner wall. Anderson was seen jumping out of the window shortly before the truck came to a stop and was tended to quickly by stewards. The driver was taken to the track medical center before being airlifted to a nearby hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. “So grateful for all the prayers and support. Have been in some great hands with all the NASCAR and UAB nurses and doctors,” Anderson tweeted. “No doubt God’s hand was protecting me through that one. Scariest moment of my racing career so far.” Anderson, who is also a team owner, was making his fifth series start of the year and had been doing well before flames suddenly began bellowing out from underneath his Chevrolet on the 19th lap of the 94-lap race. The vehicle then skidded around the track momentarily before sliding down and hitting the retainer wall in a ball of smoke, somehow missing the other drivers in the race. “Ended up with second-degree burns across my neck, face, right arm, hands and both knees,” Anderson added. “Getting cleared to go home tonight. Doctors say everything should be healing within a few weeks. “Will keep everyone updated on the healing process but just thankful it wasn’t worse.” ",258,motorsport,2022-10-03,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/motorsport/jordan-anderson-nascar-driver-burns-spt-intl/index.html

      Sebastian Vettel believes world needs to ‘rethink our behaviors’ to tackle climate change
    ","Sebastian Vettel has never been afraid to speak his mind. But his mindset and approach to issues away from the track have developed with age and experience. Vettel – who announced he will retire from Formula One at the end of the season following a stellar career – spoke to CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix about how he’s planning to adjust to life at home with his family. But the 35-year-old expressed how, as he’s grown older and been more receptive of issues away from the track, he is more willing to take steps to tackle them. “It sounds a bit stereotype, but you turn 30 and I mean, I have kids, so things change,” he explained. “And as much as I’m the same as I used to be 10 years ago, I’m not the same and a lot of things have changed. “So also, when it comes to interests or how you see the world and how you understand the world and I think I’ve always been trying to see things, but maybe I didn’t see as many things when I was young compared to today. Some things, I’m thinking: ‘What? How could you miss them?’” And one of the topics Vettel is very passionate about is climate change and the extent that should be taken to tackle the issue. Earlier this year, the four-time world champion said that climate change had made him question his job as a driver traveling the world to race cars. Vettel believes that the racing world is “not doing enough” to reinvest the vast profits it makes because “the problem we are facing is bigger than we maybe understand.” “I feel there’s a lot of money in Formula One, a lot of money that gets turned over and it’s about how much money we are happy to reinvest. And I think that’s not just for Formula One, but for any businesses out there,” Vettel said. “Obviously, we have big events, a lot of people attending so you need to have the infrastructure in place to transport these people if you want to stop them coming by car, for example, which here in the Netherlands, works well because it’s so isolated and there’s only two roads and it would be a disaster if everybody could come by car.” F1 are attempting to tackle the issue of climate change with new engine regulations that will come into play in 2026. In these new generation of cars, the engines will use significantly less energy, will use fully sustainable fuels and will produce net zero exhaust CO2 emissions, while still preserving the same power and speed fans love. Vettel believes that if the sport wanted to implement those changes sooner, it could, but would require it to put “internal problems” aside. “Obviously, to exercise our passion, we burn fuel and that’s what people see. And if people criticize that, it’s fair,” he said. “It’s fair to be criticized in a time where we are talking about approaching a winter where people might be not as comfortable as they used to be and might be freezing at home and will have to face very, very different problems, not being able to pay their bills, etc. and so on. So I think it’s right that we do see that and we try and challenge it.” He added: “It needs us, you and me, to rethink our behaviors and be happy with maybe changing some things and giving up some of the comfort. Let’s face it, it boils down to comfort often. “And on the other hand, it needs systematic change. It needs regulations and rules that don’t allow you to hold the event unless you do certain things and you tick certain boxes.” Like another great champion in another sport – Serena Williams – 2022 is the year for Vettel to step away from the cockpit, hang up the helmet and retire from racing. Over his 15-year career, he became one of the sport’s most successful drivers, recording 53 race wins and 122 podiums. Between 2010 and 2013, he was the dominant driver in F1, winning the driver’s championship title four successive years while driving for Red Bull. Only Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher have claimed more wins than Vettel, who is currently in his second year racing for Aston Martin after a six-year stint with Ferrari. After such a distinguished career behind the wheel, Vettel is relishing the opportunity to spend more time with his three kids, without also having to worry about his performance on the track. “It sounds maybe funny, but just to be also there when I’m there and not in my thoughts and thinking of what I might need to do and prepare and think of to outsmart or outdrive the others,” Vettel said. He added: “And I know that the way I did this job for so many years and want to do it, and I’m convinced it is right to do it, takes a big effort and a lot of energy. And if you try to do all the things at the same time, it doesn’t work. “So it’s been tough anyways, but I think I’ve managed very well and to be there and to do this. I think that the time feels right to do other things, like I said, which is obviously a big part focusing on family life, but also discover new sides or new elements about me and the interests that I have and give them more space and more time and more room to explore really.” But although he retires as one of the most successful drivers in F1 history, Vettel acknowledges that he will be forgotten due to the nature of time. “For the racing, for what I have achieved on the track. But then that will be forgotten one day because there’s new kids, they’re really doing great and they will continue to do great. And then there will be new kids again. “So, hopefully, we’ll have some girls and women in the future as well. I don’t think I need to be remembered and I’m not offended if people forget me in this regard. So I think I’m happy with what I have achieved, but it’s normal that time goes on and there’s new heroes to be celebrated.
