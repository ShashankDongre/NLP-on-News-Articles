Austin police chief knocks down 'rampant rumor' of serial killer in Texas capital,"The City Council approved the resolution after hearing testimony of family of loved ones who had disappeared or were found dead in Lady Bird Lake. A series of men found dead in downtown Austin who were roughly the same age and found in the same body of water are likely not the victims of a serial killer, according to the Texas capital's chief of police. Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said detectives suspected accidents or suicides in the recent string of deaths — but he left open the door should additional information become known to investigators. His statement comes as speculation that deaths in the city's Lady Bird Lake — four since February and double that over the past year — could have a connection. Of those, three were discovered near the edge of Rainey Street, a popular downtown strip, and a fourth was located about two miles downriver near a dam. BODIES STACK UP IN TEXAS CITY AMID FEARS OF SERIAL KILLER, RUMORS OF ‘ROOFIE’ ATTACKS Wooden fencing lines the edge of the trail between Rainey Street in downtown Austin and the Lady Bird Lake waterfront, where men have been discovered dead this year. (Matteo Cina/Fox News Digital) ""I realize that there is a rampant rumor about a potential serial killer here in Austin,"" Chacon told FOX 7 Austin. ""We've found no evidence of that."" ""Nothing has come to light that would indicate that there is a serial killer in Austin,"" the chief said. Police had a visible presence on Rainey Street over the weekend, out in force along the strip. City officials have also begun discussing ways to make the waterfront safer, including adding lights to the trails there and increasing Park Ranger patrols. They have also installed high temporary fencing. This undated photo is of Jason John, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Feb. 13, 2023. TEXAS SERIAL KILLER FEARS RISE AS LAKE DEATHS CLIMB TO 4 Austin police for weeks have said publicly that they have not uncovered evidence of foul play in any of the deaths, as their investigations continue. But many Austin residents, as well as independent investigators and web sleuths alike, have argued that the number of bodies found so close to one another is more than a coincidence, especially due to the distance between the strip of bars on Rainey Street and the waterfront itself. This undated photo is of Jonathan Honey, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Saturday, April 1, 2023. The edge of Lady Bird Lake is about a block and a half from the strip and requires climbing over a fence and down a trail.

Police told Fox News Digital Monday his remains were located on the 500 block of Thompson Lane Thursday morning.

Idaho student murders: Bryan Kohberger defense claims surviving roommate has 'exculpatory' evidence,"Correspondent Dan Springer reports the latest from Seattle, Washington. A defense investigator working on behalf of University of Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger asserted in a newly unveiled court filing that a surviving housemate has ""exculpatory"" information that is ""material and necessary"" to the alleged killer's defense. Kohberger, a former criminology Ph.D. candidate, is accused of entering an off-campus home on Nov. 13 around 4 a.m., after the occupants, all undergrad students at the school, had been out on a Friday night into early Saturday morning. Police allege he fatally stabbed four of the six people inside, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, along with Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20. The three women lived there with the two survivors, while Chapin, Kernodle's boyfriend, was spending the night. Of the two survivors, one allegedly heard a commotion and witnessed a masked man exit through a rear sliding door, according to a police affidavit. IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS DISCLOSURE UNLIKELY TIED TO STUDENT STABBINGS: EXPERTS Madison Mogen, top left, smiles on the shoulders of her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves, as they pose with Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and two other housemates in Goncalves' final Instagram post, shared the day before the four students were stabbed to death. The blurred faces are those of the victims' two surviving housemates. (@kayleegoncalves/Instagram) The second, a Nevada native named in the Nevada court filing made public Monday, allegedly heard or saw things that could clear the suspect, according to Richard Bitonti, a defense investigator working for Anne Taylor, Kohberger's court-appointed attorney. In the documents, obtained by Fox News Digital, the subpoena demands the roommate's appearance on June 28, two days into Kohberger's planned preliminary hearing, and warns of a potential fine of $500 or 25 days in jail if she refuses to appear. ""During the course of my investigation, it became known to me that [she] has information material to the charges against Mr. Kohberger,"" Bitonti wrote in an affidavit in support of the subpoena, revealed Monday after online sleuths found the case listed on a Washoe County, Nevada, court docket. A portion of that information, Bitonti added, ""is exculpatory to the defendant."" IDAHO MURDERS: BRYAN KOHBERGER LEAKS ‘HUGE ISSUE’ WITH ‘POTENTIAL TO COMPROMISE’ PROSECUTION, LAWYER WARNS Bryan Kohberger enters a courtroom in Moscow, Idaho on Jan. 12, 2023, for a status hearing. The accused murderer waived his right to a quick preliminary hearing and will appear in court again on June 26. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) The ""information is unique to her experiences and cannot be provided by another witness,"" according to the documents. As a result, Kohberger's defense is asking the court to compel her testimony at his scheduled preliminary hearing in June, as they hope to challenge the probable cause used to justify his arrest. As Fox News Digital has reported, prosecutors can sidestep his attempts to disprove probable cause by seeking a grand jury indictment behind closed doors. ""If there is no preliminary hearing, because there was a superseding indictment, the issue of the subpoena (at least for that hearing) becomes moot,"" Edwina Elcox, a Boise-based criminal defense attorney who previously represented Lori Vallow, told Fox News Digital. Bryan Kohberger, who is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, looks on as his attorney, public defender Anne Taylor, speaks during a hearing in Latah County District Court, Jan. 5, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, Pool) Even if a grand jury is empaneled behind closed doors, without involvement from Kohberger's defense team, prosecutors would be ethically bound to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence, she said. However, a grand jury would enable prosecutors to present the case without subjecting any witnesses to harrowing cross-examination from Kohberger's defense before trial. ""The prosecutor has to present such exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, even though the defense is not present,"" she said. IDAHO MURDERS: PROSECUTOR SAYS VICTIM'S FAMILY ‘POTENTIAL WITNESSES’ AS DEFENSE OPPOSES GAG ORDER APPEAL The law firm representing the surviving roommate declined to comment, citing Idaho Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall's gag order on the case. Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall speaks during a status hearing for accused murderer Bryan Kohberger on Jan. 12, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) However, in a court filing opposing the subpoena, also published Monday, Reno-based attorney Kelli Anne Viloria argued that the Idaho subpoena was improperly filed and ""there is no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to Idaho for preliminary hearing."" ""There is also no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a hearing and there is no authority to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a Nevada judge making a finding of materiality, necessity and the lack of undue hardship,"" she added. IDAHO'S MOVE TO RESURRECT FIRING SQUAD ‘MAKES SENSE’ AS ‘QUICKEST, SUREST’ DEATH PENALTY OPTION, EXPERT SAYS State police investigators look for clues in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 21, 2022. Four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in the home a week earlier. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) At the time of the stabbings, Kohberger was a Ph.D. criminology student at Washington State University, a neighboring school less than 10 miles away from the Idaho campus. He finished out the semester and drove home, cross-country, with his dad riding shotgun. After his initial arrest, Kohberger's previous public defender in his home state of Pennsylvania said his client was looking forward to being exonerated. Taylor, his attorney in Idaho, ignored requests for comment from Fox News Digital prior to the gag order and has since remained silent. In court filings, her office has slammed what it calls ""grotesquely twisted"" media coverage of the home invasion stabbing that left four college students dead of multiple stab wounds each – some of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the start of the ambush. Defense attorney Anne Taylor joins investigators at a visit to the King Road crime scene on Jan. 3, 2023. Taylor is defending Bryan Kohberger, who is charged with four counts of first-degree murder. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) Experts have told Fox News Digital that they expect Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson to be extra careful as he seeks a conviction in the potential death penalty case in order to avoid possible grounds for appeal. Last month, he informed Judge Marshall and Kohberger's team that his office would be disclosing this week ""potential Brady/Giglio material"" related to a police officer involved in the massacre probe – but that doesn't mean there is a connection with the stabbings of four University of Idaho students in November. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Brady material is information that could potentially prove a defendant's innocence, experts tell Fox News Digital. Giglio material is damaging to the integrity of a witness – in this case, one of the officers involved in the investigation. In previously released court documents, investigators alleged they had linked the suspect to the crime scene through surveillance images of his car and phone records. They also found a knife sheath next to Mogen's body that allegedly contained DNA. Kohberger faces four counts of first-degree murder and another of felony burglary. His preliminary hearing is scheduled to begin on June 26 and could take several days. Fox News' Haley Chi-Sing contributed to this report. Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

"Gabby Petito update: Laundrie family attorney seeks copies of texts, calls","Security camera video from the Whole Foods in Jackson, Wyoming, shows Gabby Petito and her suspected killer, fiancé Brian Laundrie, browsing the shelves on Aug. 27, 2021 – the last date she was seen alive. The attorney for Brian Laundrie's family is seeking copies of all the family's texts, calls and other phone records for a six-month stretch of 2021 obtained by the parents of Gabby Petito as part of a Florida civil suit connected to the travel blogger's murder. Her parents' attorney, Pat Reilly, obtained a subpoena earlier this year asking AT&T for records of calls, texts and other phone data from Brian, Christopher and Roberta Laundrie between July 2, 2021, and Nov. 13 of that year. Petito's parents are alleging that the Laundries caused them emotional distress and attempted to help their son escape justice after he strangled and bludgeoned their daughter to death during a cross-country ""van life"" road trip. In December, they added Laundrie lawyer Steve Bertolino to the lawsuit in a second amended complaint, and he asked for copies of the AT&T records on Thursday.

"Texas judge delays inmate's execution as questions over evidence, testimony examined","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Texas judge has stopped next week's scheduled execution of a death row inmate who has long said he's innocent so there can be more time to review his claims that he was convicted more than 20 years ago with false testimony and questionable evidence. Ivan Cantu had been condemned for the fatal shooting of his cousin, James Mosqueda, 27, and his cousin’s girlfriend, Amy Kitchen, 22, during a November 2000 robbery at their north Dallas home. Cantu has long claimed he is innocent. Cantu, 49, had been set for execution April 26. But state District Judge Benjamin Smith in Collin County, where Cantu was convicted, on Wednesday withdrew the execution date, saying more review is needed of the inmate’s new claims. LONGTIME TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE CAN PURSUE DNA TESTING FOLLOWING DECISION BY SUPREME COURT Bill Wirskye, first assistant district attorney with the Collin County District Attorney’s Office, declined to comment. ""Because Mr. Cantu’s case raises troubling questions that undermine the integrity of the conviction, the court’s decision to withdraw the execution date to permit further review was the appropriate next step,"" Gena Bunn, Cantu’s attorney, said in a statement on Friday. Sylvia Cantu, Ivan Cantu’s mother, said she remains hopeful ""that all of this new evidence will finally be heard in court so that Ivan can come home."" Two of the jurors who convicted Cantu have submitted declarations stating they now have doubts about the case. Ivan Cantu's execution has been delayed as evidence and testimony that convicted him of the November 2000 murders of his cousin, James Mosqueda, and Amy Kitchen, Mosqueda's girlfriend, are reexamined. (Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP) ""I do not want the execution of Mr. Cantu to be carried out unless a careful and thorough review of the evidence is conducted,"" Maurice Jacob, one the jurors, wrote in declaration from earlier this month. Prosecutors have claimed Cantu, who was convicted in 2001, killed Mosqueda, who dealt illegal drugs, and Kitchen as he tried to steal cocaine, marijuana and cash from his cousin’s home. Cantu has claimed a rival drug dealer killed his cousin. In Cantu’s apartment, police found bloody jeans with the victims’ DNA, a key to the victims’ home and a key to Kitchen’s car. Police found Cantu’s gun at his ex-girlfriend’s home. Mosqueda’s blood was found on the gun’s barrel while Cantu’s fingerprints were found on the gun’s magazine. In a 2005 affidavit, Matthew Goeller, one of Cantu’s trial attorneys, said Cantu admitted to him ""that he had indeed killed Mosqueda for ‘ripping him off’ on a drug deal"" and that Kitchen was killed because she was a witness. Cantu’s then-girlfriend, Amy Boettcher, was the prosecution’s main witness. She testified Cantu told her he was going to kill Mosqueda and Kitchen and later took her back to the crime scene after the killings. But in court documents, Bunn alleges Boettcher’s testimony is riddled with false statements. Boettcher, who died in 2021, testified Cantu stole and later got rid of Mosqueda’s Rolex watch. But the watch wasn’t stolen and was later found by Mosqueda’s family, Bunn said. EXECUTION OF TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE WHO CUT OUT HIS EYES DELAYED AFTER CONCERNS ABOUT HIS MENTAL STATE Boettcher told jurors Cantu proposed to her on the night of the killings with an engagement ring he stole from Kitchen. But witnesses have since said Cantu and Boettcher had announced their engagement and showed off the ring a week before the killings, according to Bunn. Boettcher testified Cantu placed his bloody jeans and socks in their kitchen trashcan on the night of the killings. But Cantu’s lawyers have questioned this because a police officer who was in his apartment the next day did not see the bloody clothes in the trashcan and they weren’t discovered until several days later, supporting the defense’s theory that someone else put them in the trashcan. Jeff Boettcher, Amy’s brother, testified that prior to the killings, Cantu told him he planned to kill Mosqueda and Cantu had tried to recruit him to ""clean up"" afterward. However, Jeff Boettcher has since said he ""lied"" and was not a credible witness due to his history of drug abuse, according to court documents. ""Absent the largely unimpeached testimony of the Boettchers, it is unlikely that Mr. Cantu would have been convicted,"" Bunn said in court documents. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bunn has credited an independent probe by Matt Duff, a private investigator, with uncovering much of the new evidence in the case.

UConn student gets additional 55 years for killing man with sword,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Connecticut man who viciously and randomly attacked two people with a Samurai-style sword, killing one and severely wounding the other, was sentenced Thursday to 55 years in prison, the same sentence he received for a fatal shooting and kidnapping that occurred two days after the attack. Peter Manfredonia struck 62-year-old Ted DeMers in the head with the sword, completely severed his right hand, sliced off his left thumb and index finger and repeatedly slashed his back during the attack in Willington on May 22, 2020. Manfredonia then wounded 80-year-old John Franco, who had severe injuries to his hands and wounds to his head and neck. DeMers was pronounced dead en route to the hospital. Manfredonia, now 26, who was a University of Connecticut senior in 2020 studying finance and mechanical engineering, later held another local man hostage for 24 hours. He then drove across the state to Derby, fatally shot a school classmate and kidnapped that victim’s girlfriend. He was caught in Hagerstown, Maryland, ending a six-day manhunt in several states. CONNECTICUT MAN GIVEN 55-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE FOR MURDERING FRIEND, KIDNAPPING WOMAN Manfredonia appeared in state Superior Court in Rockville on Thursday. He pleaded guilty to murder and other charges in both the Willington and Derby cases and agreed to 55-year sentences. Judge Kathleen McNamara imposed the prison term for the sword attack Thursday, which will run concurrent with the sentence for the fatal shooting and kidnapping. Although Connecticut no longer has capital punishment, both DeMers' widow, Cindy, and Franco told the judge they believed Manfredonia deserved the death penalty. Cindy DeMers described rushing to the scene of carnage outside her home that day. ""It was like being in a war zone,"" she said. ""All I could focus on was reassuring Ted that he was going to be OK and we would put his body back together. We will get through this. We had gotten through so much together up until this point. ""Dying was not an option,"" she continued. ""And even seeing him and his injuries, I couldn't even imagine that was a possibility. He was still alive when he was taken away, but he never came home. ... My husband's life was stolen from him viciously. Life as I knew it stolen from me. My world as I knew it came to an end."" Peter Manfredonia, 26, of Newtown, Connecticut, has been sentenced to a cumulative 110 years in prison for the separate killings of Nicholas Eisele and Ted DeMers, causing serious injury to John Franco and kidnapping Shannon Spies. (Ned Gerard/Hearst Connecticut Media via AP, Pool) Franco, a U.S. Navy veteran who is now 83, attended the hearing and added, ""He should be terminated. I'm a true believer in capital punishment, especially in a situation such as this."" Franco was called a hero for coming to DeMers' aid when he saw the attack. Family and friends described DeMers as a kind and generous man who coached Little League in town and would help anybody who needed it. He tried to help Manfredonia that day because he thought Manfredonia had crashed his motorcycle, witnesses said. It was the second straight day that victims of Manfredonia's violent spree offered emotional testimony in court. Manfredonia apologized at both hearings. He was sentenced on Wednesday for shooting 23-year-old Nicholas Eisele to death in Derby and kidnapping Eisele's girlfriend, whom he released unharmed a few hours later in New Jersey. Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky said Thursday that Manfredonia went to DeMers' neighborhood that day to see his ex-girlfriend, who lived nearby. Gedansky said it appeared Manfredonia had plans to kill the woman but was interrupted by Demers, who had approached him on the street to see if he needed help. FORMER UCONN STUDENT PLEADS GUILTY TO 2020 SWORD ATTACK Manfredonia's lawyer, Michael Dolan, said Manfredonia's actual plan was to commit suicide in front of his ex-girlfriend. Dolan said Manfredonia has bipolar disease and anxiety, and was having a psychotic episode at the time of the killings. Gedansky said he believed Manfredonia was desperate when he went to Eisele's apartment two days later, knowing Eisele had money. Manfredonia and Eisele grew up together in Newtown, Connecticut. Manfredonia's apology on Thursday was similar to the one he made on Wednesday. He directed separate comments to DeMers' family, Franco and Donald Hipsky, the man whose home Manfredonia broke into after the sword attack and who was held hostage for 24 hours but not physically hurt. ""There are no words that can possibly atone for what I have done. Know that I am sorry nonetheless,"" he said to DeMers' family. ""You have done nothing to deserve the pain that I have caused.

Alex Murdaugh's life in lockup: Lawyer reveals exclusive details,"Criminal defense attorney Mark Eiglarsh gives his take on Alex Murdaugh's team appealing his murder conviction on 'The Story.' Convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh has become a notable jailhouse figure who plays checkers and cards with other inmates — but steers clear of the convicted sex offenders in his unit, according to his attorney. ""When he came in, he obviously had a lot of notoriety and was a celebrity of sorts, but he gets along with everybody in the pod,"" Jim Griffin told Fox News Digital of Murdaugh's new home at McCormick Correctional Institution in South Carolina. Murdaugh, 54, is behind bars in the protective custody wing of the maximum security prison, which houses about 28 inmates who are considered potential targets — including child abusers and former law enforcement officers. ""He has a small group he interacts with regularly,"" Griffin said. Murdaugh, he added, avoids the ""significant number"" of inmates in the small unit who were ""convicted of some pretty horrendous sex crimes."" ALEX MURDAUGH'S SECRET PRISON LOCATION REVEALED Alex Murdaugh has been transferred to the McCormick Correctional Institution in South Carolina. (South Carolina Department of Corrections/Google Maps) Murdaugh was sentenced to two life terms last month for fatally shooting his wife, Maggie, 52, and his son, Paul, 22, in June 2021 in an attempt to cover up his alleged financial malfeasance. He arrived at McCormick from Kirkland Correctional Institution on March 31.

Corrections officials told Griffin that some inmates had posted menacing TikTok videos using contraband cellphones threatening physical harm to Murdaugh if they see him in the yard. The attorney added that he was not sure what Murdaugh and the other inmates watch on TV at McCormick, but at Kirkland, there was a clear favorite. ""I've learned that a lot of inmates watch CourtTV. It's their channel,"" he said. In fact, at Kirkland, Murdaugh was ""surprised by the extensive coverage of his case"" on the show after his trial had ended.

Austin police chief knocks down 'rampant rumor' of serial killer in Texas capital,"The City Council approved the resolution after hearing testimony of family of loved ones who had disappeared or were found dead in Lady Bird Lake. A series of men found dead in downtown Austin who were roughly the same age and found in the same body of water are likely not the victims of a serial killer, according to the Texas capital's chief of police. Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said detectives suspected accidents or suicides in the recent string of deaths — but he left open the door should additional information become known to investigators. His statement comes as speculation that deaths in the city's Lady Bird Lake — four since February and double that over the past year — could have a connection. Of those, three were discovered near the edge of Rainey Street, a popular downtown strip, and a fourth was located about two miles downriver near a dam. BODIES STACK UP IN TEXAS CITY AMID FEARS OF SERIAL KILLER, RUMORS OF ‘ROOFIE’ ATTACKS Wooden fencing lines the edge of the trail between Rainey Street in downtown Austin and the Lady Bird Lake waterfront, where men have been discovered dead this year. (Matteo Cina/Fox News Digital) ""I realize that there is a rampant rumor about a potential serial killer here in Austin,"" Chacon told FOX 7 Austin. ""We've found no evidence of that."" ""Nothing has come to light that would indicate that there is a serial killer in Austin,"" the chief said. Police had a visible presence on Rainey Street over the weekend, out in force along the strip. City officials have also begun discussing ways to make the waterfront safer, including adding lights to the trails there and increasing Park Ranger patrols. They have also installed high temporary fencing. This undated photo is of Jason John, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Feb. 13, 2023. TEXAS SERIAL KILLER FEARS RISE AS LAKE DEATHS CLIMB TO 4 Austin police for weeks have said publicly that they have not uncovered evidence of foul play in any of the deaths, as their investigations continue. But many Austin residents, as well as independent investigators and web sleuths alike, have argued that the number of bodies found so close to one another is more than a coincidence, especially due to the distance between the strip of bars on Rainey Street and the waterfront itself. This undated photo is of Jonathan Honey, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on Saturday, April 1, 2023. The edge of Lady Bird Lake is about a block and a half from the strip and requires climbing over a fence and down a trail.

This undated photo is of Clifton Axtell, whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake, Austin, TX on in 2023. Police found Jason John, 30, dead in Lady Bird Lake in February, a week after he was last been seen on Rainey Street, which has a popular row of bars near the water.

Idaho student murders: Bryan Kohberger defense claims surviving roommate has 'exculpatory' evidence,"Correspondent Dan Springer reports the latest from Seattle, Washington. A defense investigator working on behalf of University of Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger asserted in a newly unveiled court filing that a surviving housemate has ""exculpatory"" information that is ""material and necessary"" to the alleged killer's defense. Kohberger, a former criminology Ph.D. candidate, is accused of entering an off-campus home on Nov. 13 around 4 a.m., after the occupants, all undergrad students at the school, had been out on a Friday night into early Saturday morning. Police allege he fatally stabbed four of the six people inside, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, along with Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20. The three women lived there with the two survivors, while Chapin, Kernodle's boyfriend, was spending the night. Of the two survivors, one allegedly heard a commotion and witnessed a masked man exit through a rear sliding door, according to a police affidavit. IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS DISCLOSURE UNLIKELY TIED TO STUDENT STABBINGS: EXPERTS Madison Mogen, top left, smiles on the shoulders of her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves, as they pose with Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and two other housemates in Goncalves' final Instagram post, shared the day before the four students were stabbed to death. The blurred faces are those of the victims' two surviving housemates. (@kayleegoncalves/Instagram) The second, a Nevada native named in the Nevada court filing made public Monday, allegedly heard or saw things that could clear the suspect, according to Richard Bitonti, a defense investigator working for Anne Taylor, Kohberger's court-appointed attorney. In the documents, obtained by Fox News Digital, the subpoena demands the roommate's appearance on June 28, two days into Kohberger's planned preliminary hearing, and warns of a potential fine of $500 or 25 days in jail if she refuses to appear. ""During the course of my investigation, it became known to me that [she] has information material to the charges against Mr. Kohberger,"" Bitonti wrote in an affidavit in support of the subpoena, revealed Monday after online sleuths found the case listed on a Washoe County, Nevada, court docket. A portion of that information, Bitonti added, ""is exculpatory to the defendant."" IDAHO MURDERS: BRYAN KOHBERGER LEAKS ‘HUGE ISSUE’ WITH ‘POTENTIAL TO COMPROMISE’ PROSECUTION, LAWYER WARNS Bryan Kohberger enters a courtroom in Moscow, Idaho on Jan. 12, 2023, for a status hearing. The accused murderer waived his right to a quick preliminary hearing and will appear in court again on June 26. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) The ""information is unique to her experiences and cannot be provided by another witness,"" according to the documents. As a result, Kohberger's defense is asking the court to compel her testimony at his scheduled preliminary hearing in June, as they hope to challenge the probable cause used to justify his arrest. As Fox News Digital has reported, prosecutors can sidestep his attempts to disprove probable cause by seeking a grand jury indictment behind closed doors. ""If there is no preliminary hearing, because there was a superseding indictment, the issue of the subpoena (at least for that hearing) becomes moot,"" Edwina Elcox, a Boise-based criminal defense attorney who previously represented Lori Vallow, told Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, Pool) Even if a grand jury is empaneled behind closed doors, without involvement from Kohberger's defense team, prosecutors would be ethically bound to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence, she said. However, a grand jury would enable prosecutors to present the case without subjecting any witnesses to harrowing cross-examination from Kohberger's defense before trial. ""The prosecutor has to present such exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, even though the defense is not present,"" she said. IDAHO MURDERS: PROSECUTOR SAYS VICTIM'S FAMILY ‘POTENTIAL WITNESSES’ AS DEFENSE OPPOSES GAG ORDER APPEAL The law firm representing the surviving roommate declined to comment, citing Idaho Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall's gag order on the case. Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall speaks during a status hearing for accused murderer Bryan Kohberger on Jan. 12, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) However, in a court filing opposing the subpoena, also published Monday, Reno-based attorney Kelli Anne Viloria argued that the Idaho subpoena was improperly filed and ""there is no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to Idaho for preliminary hearing."" ""There is also no authority for an Idaho criminal defendant to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a hearing and there is no authority to summon a Nevada witness to an Idaho matter without a Nevada judge making a finding of materiality, necessity and the lack of undue hardship,"" she added. IDAHO'S MOVE TO RESURRECT FIRING SQUAD ‘MAKES SENSE’ AS ‘QUICKEST, SUREST’ DEATH PENALTY OPTION, EXPERT SAYS State police investigators look for clues in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 21, 2022. Four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in the home a week earlier. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) At the time of the stabbings, Kohberger was a Ph.D. criminology student at Washington State University, a neighboring school less than 10 miles away from the Idaho campus. He finished out the semester and drove home, cross-country, with his dad riding shotgun. After his initial arrest, Kohberger's previous public defender in his home state of Pennsylvania said his client was looking forward to being exonerated. Taylor, his attorney in Idaho, ignored requests for comment from Fox News Digital prior to the gag order and has since remained silent. In court filings, her office has slammed what it calls ""grotesquely twisted"" media coverage of the home invasion stabbing that left four college students dead of multiple stab wounds each – some of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the start of the ambush. Defense attorney Anne Taylor joins investigators at a visit to the King Road crime scene on Jan. 3, 2023. Taylor is defending Bryan Kohberger, who is charged with four counts of first-degree murder. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) Experts have told Fox News Digital that they expect Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson to be extra careful as he seeks a conviction in the potential death penalty case in order to avoid possible grounds for appeal. Last month, he informed Judge Marshall and Kohberger's team that his office would be disclosing this week ""potential Brady/Giglio material"" related to a police officer involved in the massacre probe – but that doesn't mean there is a connection with the stabbings of four University of Idaho students in November. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Brady material is information that could potentially prove a defendant's innocence, experts tell Fox News Digital. Giglio material is damaging to the integrity of a witness – in this case, one of the officers involved in the investigation. In previously released court documents, investigators alleged they had linked the suspect to the crime scene through surveillance images of his car and phone records. They also found a knife sheath next to Mogen's body that allegedly contained DNA. Kohberger faces four counts of first-degree murder and another of felony burglary. His preliminary hearing is scheduled to begin on June 26 and could take several days. Fox News' Haley Chi-Sing contributed to this report. Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

But if archeologists do in fact confirm it is a shipwreck, it would be the second time since the two hurricanes pummeled Florida, that a shipwreck has been discovered near Daytona Beach. FLORIDA BEACH MYSTERY: DEBRIS FOUND ON SHORE AFTER HURRICANE Back in December, another wreck was exposed by erosion in Daytona Beach Shores. When crews investigated December’s wreckage, they believed it was part of a ship that sailed in the mid-to-late 1800s. ""Imagine as many Amazon trucks that you see on the roads today, this was the equivalent in the 1800s,"" Christopher McCarron, archeology administrative director and the vessel captain of the St. Augustine maritime program, told FOX 35 then. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McCarron did not immediately respond to questions from Fox News Digital on Monday regarding the latest find off the coast. The debris in Daytona Beach Shores adds to a few other discoveries that were made in Florida after Hurricane Nicole. Human remains were unearthed by Hurricane Nicole on Hutchinson Island, that officials said they believed may have come from a Native American burial mound. A photographer also spotted a 1930s trunk washing ashore near St. Augustine following the violent storm, though nothing of value was in the trunk, according to officials.

"Border chaos as smuggler leads Texas DPS on high-speed chase before flipping car over, illegals flee on foot","Texas Department of Public Safety says there were five illegal immigrants in the vehicle. A smuggler transporting illegal immigrants led authorities on a high-speed pursuit last Thursday before losing control of the vehicle and flipping over on a dirt road. Lt. Chris Olivarez of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) said the high-speed chase happened in Hidalgo County, near the southern tip of Texas, along the Mexican border. TEXAS GRANDMA, GRANDDAUGHTER KILLED IN CRASH INVOLVING HUMAN SMUGGLER The driver lost control of the vehicle on a dirt road and flipped over.  (Texas DPS) A video shared by Olivarez on Twitter shows authorities engaged in a high-speed pursuit of the vehicle along Bentsen Palm Road in Hidalgo County. The vehicle can be seen weaving around other vehicles on the road. At some point, the driver turns onto a dirt road, loses control of the vehicle, and flips over.

Former Ohio Gov. Bob Taft weighs in on hot-button constitutional amendment reform plan,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Former Republican Ohio Gov. Bob Taft urged state lawmakers on Monday against advancing a measure that would make it harder to amend the state constitution or reviving August special elections to do it — calling the combination ""especially bad public policy."" Taft, the scion of one of Ohio's most famous political families, sent a letter of protest to General Assembly members as a faction of GOP legislators and a coalition of powerful lobbyists scramble to get ahead of an amendment guaranteeing Ohioans' access to abortion that organizers hope to get on the November ballot. The Ohio Senate approved a resolution last week that would raise the threshold for citizens to pass future changes to the Ohio Constitution from 50%-plus-one to 60%, but the measure's fate in the politically fractured Ohio House has not yet been determined. OHIO REPUBLICANS PUSH TO RESTRICT CHANGES TO STATE'S CONSTITUTION AS ABORTION RIGHTS REMAIN A QUESTION A plan devised by Republican Senate President Matt Huffman and supported by Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose involves setting a special August election to put the 60% question before voters. The move comes only a few months after lawmakers passed legislation abolishing such elections in most cases. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed that bill in January, said on Monday that he would sign a bill to reverse it, should it clear both legislative chambers. Taft, who served as both governor and Ohio secretary of state, said he knows from running Ohio elections that few voters show up at the polls in the summer. Former Ohio Gov. Bob Taft has urged against fellow Republicans' plan to raise the public vote share threshold to 60% in order to pass new amendments to the Buckeye State's constitution. (Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""For more than 100 years, amendments to the Ohio Constitution have been decided by a simple majority vote,"" he wrote. ""The decision to change such a deeply embedded practice should not be made at a low turnout election."" He said such a question belongs on a general election ballot, when there is maximum turnout. But Taft said he also opposes raising the threshold for passing future constitutional amendments at all. Taft noted that two of his own signature initiatives as governor — the Clean Ohio Fund and the Third Frontier Project — would not have been approved under the higher threshold. The former passed with 57.4% of the vote, the latter — after an initial defeat — with 54.1%, he wrote. OHIO LAWMAKER MOVES TO FORCE VOTE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT RULES ""Both measures have stood the test of time, contributing importantly to the economy and quality of life of our state,"" Taft wrote. Taft, governor from 1999 to 2007, also warned that Ohio can't raise its debt limit above $750,000 without a vote of the people. Raising the threshold to 60% could mean that raising the debt limit to fund highway or school construction, environmental protection or job creation programs ""may become impossible in the years to come,"" he wrote. A similar argument was made in January by a coalition of voting rights, faith, labor and other organizations lined up to fight the measure. But Taft's last-minute opposition may do little to deter the 60% measure from moving forward, possibly as soon as this week. Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis said the necessary 60 representatives have committed to voting yes, and that list has been shared with Stephens. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gonidakis let lawmakers know that their votes on the resolution, as well as the bill setting a special August election, will be counted toward their ""pro-life"" records when scorecards are issued at election time, he said. The Buckeye Firearms Association, which supports raising the threshold to 60% to keep Ohioans from passing future gun control amendments, will use the same approach on its gun rights scorecards, Gonidakis said.

"Panel of Democrats, environmental activists blame climate change for whale deaths","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Climate change, spurred by the burning of fossil fuels, is the biggest danger to marine life including whales, a panel of Democratic officials and environmental groups said Monday. The gathering, held in an oceanfront conference room as a half-dozen dolphins frolicked in the ocean behind them, also strongly criticized a bill in the House of Representatives containing numerous incentives for oil and gas companies, and which eliminates several environmental protections currently in effect. It also was a retort to opponents of offshore wind development, who claim that preparation for wind farms off New Jersey and New York are killing whales along the U.S. East Coast. Numerous federal and state agencies say there is no evidence that the deaths are related to offshore wind survey work. MYSTERY OVER WHALE DEATHS SPARKS ALARM: WE NEED TO 'PAUSE AND INVESTIGATE' The event came a week after U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. and other New Jersey Congressional Democrats wrote to the White House Council on Environmental Quality ""demanding real solutions in response to the death of marine mammals off New Jersey’s coast."" But the letter did not seek pause in offshore wind projects as many Republicans demand. Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, two Republican Congressmen from New Jersey, want the work stopped at least temporarily. Neither responded to a request for comment Monday. No Republican elected officials were at Monday's event. Earlier this month, Republican New Jersey state senators Declan O’Scanlon and Ed Durr introduced a resolution calling on the federal and state governments to enact a moratorium on offshore wind preparation, saying ""We cannot ignore the surge in marine life deaths that has occurred while offshore wind project preparation activities have been conducted along the coast."" At Monday's event, Pallone said, ""The science has not linked the whale deaths to offshore wind activities. Climate change is the biggest threat to marine mammals."" Pallone and others said that as water temperatures rise, fish species that whales prey upon have been moving into different areas, bringing whales more frequently into the path of heavily traveled shipping lanes off the East Coast. A panel of environmental activists and Democrat politicians on Monday denied offshore renewable energy projects' potential effects on a recent uptick in whale deaths and beachings off the Atlantic Coast. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry) Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, said the migrating bait fish are ""bringing marine life into direct contact with the shipping superhighway that sits off our coast."" As Ed Potosnak of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters put it, ""They're having a picnic in the Parkway; they're getting hit."" Of the 32 whales that have died off the East Coast since Dec. 1, many have shown signs of being struck by ships or being entangled in discarded fishing gear, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month after a speech at Monmouth University, NOAA's administrator, Richard Spinrad, said ship strikes are a common cause of recent whale deaths. ""We study the fisheries, where the fish are, what the populations are, and there is some thought as to the whales following a change, a shift in where the prey is that the whales feed on, which may be a consequence of a change in the ocean itself,"" Spinrad said. ""By moving further inshore these whales are then more vulnerable to things like ship strikes. The science that we have conducted suggests there is not a link between the activities of offshore wind and the strandings we've seen along the East Coast."" U.S. Sen Cory Booker said burning fossil fuels ""is causing our house to be on fire, and we have been supplying the matches."" NOAA REPORT SAYS NEW JERSEY TURBINES MAY 'ADVERSELY AFFECT' WHALES, BUT DENIES LETHALITY Capt. Paul Eidman, of the group Anglers for Offshore Wind Power, said climate change is already affecting commercial and recreational fishing by changing where bait fish — and their predators — travel. ""Offshore wind energy offers a clean, economical, beneficial opportunity to combat the climate crisis and an alternative to continuing to burn fossil fuels,"" he said. ""We cannot ignore the fact that the impacts of climate change are disrupting species migration and holding patterns, posing serious risks to the long-term future of recreational fishing and the species we rely on."" Panelists sharply criticized HR1, a bill being pushed by House Republicans to lower energy costs by giving incentives to fossil fuel industries, rolling back many environmental laws and protections, and limiting the power of a president or government agency to limit or prevent energy projects on federal land.

Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET. Though Thomas Alva Edison’s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don’t realize that Edison almost wasn’t the world’s greatest inventor. A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers. At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as ""a dunce."" But his mother saw something else in her Al. GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE While creating my new ""Turnabout Tales"" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison’s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself.  I believe each of us has a ""Turnabout Tale,"" whether in our past or in the future. Raymond Arroyo (Courtesy Raymond Arroyo) Edison’s ""Turnabout"" really began at age eight.  Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle’s schoolhouse in 1855.   The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al.  He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD.  Edison said of this period: ""The teachers did not sympathize with me and…my father thought I was stupid.""  His teacher did as well. One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was ""addled"" and ""unable to be taught."" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself.  Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison’s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor. Thomas Edison (Associated Press) Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al’s daring, hands on experimentation. Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor’s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom’s pursuits. I don’t know why Thomas Edison isn’t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life: ""My mother was the making of me…she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor."" Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo is the author of ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" (Fox News) It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing. ""Deafness probably drove me to reading."" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone. But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life. Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands. Surrounded by books, at his ""Invention Factory"" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation. Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe.  The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car—all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught. At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison’s must be preserved and spread.  History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future. Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother.  If it hadn’t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems.

"Black history through the years: Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Former Olympian John Carlos and former NFL player Jack Brewer join Harris Faulkner on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia. Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture. Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today. BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today. Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years. Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports. Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court. BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner. Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance. Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850). Portrait of Frederick Douglass, who was born into slavery in 1818. (iStock) Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland. He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress. Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881). BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment. Harriet Tubman, American abolitionist leader (1820-1913), escaped slavery by marrying a free man and led many other slaves to safety through the use of the abolitionist network known as the Underground Railroad.    (MPI/Getty Images) Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross. She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished. Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more."" Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS. By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid. Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri. While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865. Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree. YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college. American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation. Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports. Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage. Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900). Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931. American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports. He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke. Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth."" Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism."" Thurgood Marshall, the great-grandson of a slave, was the first Black member of the United States Supreme Court. (Getty Images) Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore. He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports. From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights. THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal."" Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases. His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991. Rosa Parks, civil rights activist, was born in 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. (Getty Images) Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports. At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow. The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time. The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute. She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991. Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.

Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET. Though Thomas Alva Edison’s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don’t realize that Edison almost wasn’t the world’s greatest inventor. A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers. At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as ""a dunce."" But his mother saw something else in her Al. GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE While creating my new ""Turnabout Tales"" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison’s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself.  I believe each of us has a ""Turnabout Tale,"" whether in our past or in the future. Raymond Arroyo (Courtesy Raymond Arroyo) Edison’s ""Turnabout"" really began at age eight.  Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle’s schoolhouse in 1855.   The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al.  He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD.  Edison said of this period: ""The teachers did not sympathize with me and…my father thought I was stupid.""  His teacher did as well. One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was ""addled"" and ""unable to be taught."" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself.  Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison’s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor. Thomas Edison (Associated Press) Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al’s daring, hands on experimentation. Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor’s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom’s pursuits. I don’t know why Thomas Edison isn’t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life: ""My mother was the making of me…she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor."" Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo is the author of ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" (Fox News) It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing. ""Deafness probably drove me to reading."" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone. But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life. Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands. Surrounded by books, at his ""Invention Factory"" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation. Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe.  The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car—all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught. At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison’s must be preserved and spread.  History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future. Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother.  If it hadn’t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems. I hope this first ""Turnabout Tale: helps us all to see the possibility in every young life and to recognize the responsibility we as adults have to nurture the light within them.

"Black history through the years: Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Former Olympian John Carlos and former NFL player Jack Brewer join Harris Faulkner on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia. Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture. Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today. BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today. Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years. Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports. Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court. BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner. Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance. Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850). Portrait of Frederick Douglass, who was born into slavery in 1818. (iStock) Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland. He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress. Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881). BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment. Harriet Tubman, American abolitionist leader (1820-1913), escaped slavery by marrying a free man and led many other slaves to safety through the use of the abolitionist network known as the Underground Railroad.    (MPI/Getty Images) Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross. She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished. Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more."" Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS. By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid. Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri. While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865. Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree. YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college. American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation. Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports. Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage. Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900). Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931. American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports. He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke. Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth."" Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism."" Thurgood Marshall, the great-grandson of a slave, was the first Black member of the United States Supreme Court. (Getty Images) Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore. He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports. From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights. THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal."" Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases. His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to McCarthy’s debt ceiling plan,"Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Republicans' proposal and why Biden's action is 'risky' as the battle over government spending continues. This week marks the biggest test yet for the speakership of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. McCarthy needs to show that he can keep his members together to approve the Republican version of a debt ceiling plan. This is not a zero-sum game for the Speaker. Passage of the bill would mark a significant win for the California Republican. McCarthy would show he could keep his narrow majority and pass a big piece of legislation. But the political chits McCarthy banks with a prospective win are not equivalent to the points he could lose if Republicans struggle to pass the bill. A stumble would represent a major loss for McCarthy. Moreover, failure by Republicans to move their own plan could rattle the markets and send an ominous signal about what to expect later this summer as the sides fight over the debt ceiling. President Biden remains on the sidelines for now. Even some Democrats question the wisdom of that – especially considering how close the nation is creeping to a still unknown debt ceiling deadline. It is generally believed the date will hit sooner rather than later – meaning early to mid-June. That’s because the early read is that receipts for this tax season are down as well as revenue from capital gains. There is also increasing jitteriness about ""credit default swaps."" That’s where the cost of insuring against potential losses in U.S. Treasuries is beginning to be a factor. HOUSE REPUBLICANS TAKE ON EMPIRE STATE OF MIND AMID DEBT CEILING STANDOFF, TRUMP INDICTMENT Fox is told that Mr. Biden will stay away from the bargaining table until House Republicans show this week whether they can approve their own debt ceiling bill. U.S. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), joined by fellow Republican lawmakers, holds a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on March 24, 2023, in Washington, DC. McCarthy spoke after the House passed the Parents Bill of Rights Act, 213-208, sending the bill to the Senate. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) It’s all about that math. McCarthy can lose no more than five votes on his side of the aisle to pass the bill without help from Democrats. If not, McCarthy must develop another plan – or punt. ""We will keep trying until we figure something out,"" said one senior House Republican leadership source when asked about ‘Plan B.’ Interestingly, most conservatives appear more willing to support McCarthy’s package right now. Some moderates are skeptical about people falling through the cracks. There’s worry about cuts to emergency food assistance and Medicaid. The current proposal requires able-bodied adults with no dependents to work 20 hours a week to qualify for benefits. Some conservatives want to bolster that to 30 hours. The definition of work requirements are fairly liberal. ""Working"" could actually mean someone being on the job. But it also means seeking work, receiving formal training for work or even volunteering. Some midwestern members fret about reductions in ethanol tax credits and assistance which is part of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) approved last summer. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 04: U.S. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) (R) talks members-elect as Rep.-elect Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) (L) and Rep.-elect Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) watch in the House Chamber during the second day of elections for Speaker of the House at the U.S. Capitol Building on January 04, 2023, in Washington, DC.  ((Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)) ""The ethanol piece has been a Bob Dole problem since 1988,"" groused one Republican close to the talks. ""I’m not really sure that setting your food on fire is a good energy policy. But here we are."" All House Republicans opposed the IRA. But many Republicans like various ""ala carte"" items in the IRA. Republicans talk doom about the IRA constantly. However, they are unable to muster the votes to repeal the IRA. So, plucking off various parts of the IRA in McCarthy’s bill is the next best thing. The ethanol issue could cause heartburn for some midwestern Republicans. But so far, passage appears within reach. ""The Speaker has done a good job of finding the sweet spot here,"" said one Republican House member who asked not to be identified. ""This package is so conservative, you can’t vote against it,"" observed another Republican, noting that various right-wing interest groups will ‘score’ or issue or mark this as a ‘key vote’ documenting which Members supported the plan and who didn’t. Keep in mind that this measure will not be the final bill. The Senate won’t consider this particular package. One knowledgeable source said that McCarthy had to cobble together a measure just ""to get the monkey off our back"" that Republicans weren’t engaged. However, passing the bill presents the Senate a debt ceiling ""legislative vehicle"" with which to work over the next few weeks. The Senate could potentially take the bill and strip out the House language. Senators could then drop in their own provisions which can overcome a filibuster and send it back to the House when the nation approaches the deadline. In essence, having a legislative vehicle available on the debt ceiling helps both sides in the long run – even if they disagree with the policy. It just makes things easier parliamentarily. But here’s the real problem. The ultimate bill which raises the debt ceiling must garner 60 yeas to break a filibuster in the Senate. We’re weeks away from that. And no one knows what that bill looks like. Members from the conservative House Freedom Caucus will likely balk because a final piece of legislation on the debt ceiling won’t mirror what they agreed to in McCarthy’s bill. That’s where things could get dicey for McCarthy. ""Either he takes the Senate bill and faces a (no confidence vote) or we default,"" said one House Republican. ""That’s quite a choice."" That’s why there are increasing worries about a market shock or one of the ratings agencies knocking down the credit worthiness of the U.S. ""Every day that goes by that we do not get this resolved is not a good day,"" said Fox Business Contributor Gary Kaltbaum. ""And you never know what's going to be the tipping point. But there eventually will be a tipping point."" A senior GOP source familiar with the timing of the bill says the Republican brass plans to put the McCarthy measure on the floor Wednesday. House Republican leaders aim for Wednesday so they have Thursday and Friday as backstops if the votes aren’t there and the legislation requires more massaging. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., arrives at the Capitol as the House meets for a second day to elect a speaker and convene the 118th Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ""We’ll pass this by the skin of our teeth,"" said one veteran Republican. ""We never do it the easy way. We’re Republicans."" The bigger issue will be when the House is forced to vote on the ""real"" bill in a few weeks. Fox is told that Freedom Caucus members succeeded in securing many of their demands. It’s unclear if they could swallow changes down the road. It’s possible that anything short of the McCarthy bill gives those conservative members enough of a reason to vote no BATHROOM POLITICS: REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY'VE FOUND WEDGE ISSUE WITH TRANSGENDER ATHLETESAlso on the table is a possible move by House Democrats and some Republicans to go over the head of the Speaker and deposit a separate debt ceiling bill on the floor. This is called a ""discharge petition."" It’s a rarely-successful gambit to force the House to go against the wishes of the leadership and vote on a bill engineered by the rank and file. It takes 218 members of the House to successfully advance a discharge petition. That means if all Democrats stick together to avoid an economic calamity, they’d only need to nab five Republicans to support the maneuver. However, only two discharge petitions have been successful in the House in more than two decades. That’s why everyone is starting to monitor Wall Street. ""Markets will rule. Politicians will follow the market,"" observed Kaltbalm. In other words, a market crash could compel everyone in Washington to find religion on the debt ceiling. Fast. Kaltbaum says he could envision a scenario where the market drops three percent one day. Then two percent the next day. Then four percent the day after that ""until they finally get their act together"" in Washington. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So here’s what to watch for in the coming days: McCarthy likely notches a win by the end of the week. But that ""win"" could spell trouble for McCarthy himself when it comes to the ""actual"" debt ceiling bill this summer. And that’s where the true standoff over the debt ceiling may unfold.

"Senate Dems say Biden should talk to McCarthy, but without linking debt ceiling, spending cuts","Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Republicans' proposal and why Biden's action is 'risky' as the battle over government spending continues. Democrats over the weekend said President Biden should accept House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's invitation to talk about the fiscal outlook for the federal government, but like Biden argued those talks should not combine the two issues of how to raise the government's borrowing limit and the GOP's demand for spending cuts. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., emerged over the weekend calling for Biden to speak with the Republican leader after he put out a 320-page bill that would raise the debt ceiling while capping spending and imposing work requirements for government benefits, among other measures. Neither signaled support for the spending cuts that Republicans are seeking, and made it clear any further talks should keep separate the two issues. ""Of course, President Biden should sit down with Speaker McCarthy,"" Klobuchar said Sunday on CNN Sunday. But she also indicated she favors Biden's position, which is to handle the debt ceiling first, and only then talk about possible spending cuts.

We just passed a budget with 18 Republicans voting for it in the U.S. Senate,"" she said, referring to the $1.7 trillion spending bill passed in December. She made it clear the debt ceiling should be everyone's top priority. ""Right now, we have got to simply make clear we're going to avoid default and get this behind us. We pay our bills,"" Klobuchar said. Durbin took the same approach by saying more meetings are fine as long as the issues are treated separately. ""Of course we should talk"" to Republicans, Durbin said on NBC Sunday. ""Listen, we don't need to default in this country. If we default on our national debt, it's going to cost our economy dearly.

""Now, we can have a fulsome debate on the budget, and we will. And I understand it on the spending levels, but not at the expense of jeopardizing jobs and economic growth in America. Don't default.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., released a statement late last week calling Biden’s failure to hold a second meeting with McCarthy a ""deficiency of leadership"" and even agreeing that federal spending should be reined in. Manchin said he supports the idea of linking cuts with more government authority to borrow, a position that puts him against that of others in his party in both the House and Senate who for now want to keep those issues separate.

Riot police have descended on Montana's capitol after left-wing protestors disrupted proceedings in the state House of Representatives in support of transgender lawmaker Zooey Zephyr, a Democrat, who was censured by the body last week, multiple reports have said. According to The Independent, an unknown number of protestors were arrested Monday when police units from the Montana Highway Patrol and the Lewis and Clark County sheriff’s office commenced an operation to break up the group packing the observation gallery of the House chamber.

Former Ohio Gov. Bob Taft weighs in on hot-button constitutional amendment reform plan,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Former Republican Ohio Gov. Bob Taft urged state lawmakers on Monday against advancing a measure that would make it harder to amend the state constitution or reviving August special elections to do it — calling the combination ""especially bad public policy."" Taft, the scion of one of Ohio's most famous political families, sent a letter of protest to General Assembly members as a faction of GOP legislators and a coalition of powerful lobbyists scramble to get ahead of an amendment guaranteeing Ohioans' access to abortion that organizers hope to get on the November ballot. The Ohio Senate approved a resolution last week that would raise the threshold for citizens to pass future changes to the Ohio Constitution from 50%-plus-one to 60%, but the measure's fate in the politically fractured Ohio House has not yet been determined. OHIO REPUBLICANS PUSH TO RESTRICT CHANGES TO STATE'S CONSTITUTION AS ABORTION RIGHTS REMAIN A QUESTION A plan devised by Republican Senate President Matt Huffman and supported by Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose involves setting a special August election to put the 60% question before voters. The move comes only a few months after lawmakers passed legislation abolishing such elections in most cases. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed that bill in January, said on Monday that he would sign a bill to reverse it, should it clear both legislative chambers. Taft, who served as both governor and Ohio secretary of state, said he knows from running Ohio elections that few voters show up at the polls in the summer. Former Ohio Gov. Bob Taft has urged against fellow Republicans' plan to raise the public vote share threshold to 60% in order to pass new amendments to the Buckeye State's constitution. (Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""For more than 100 years, amendments to the Ohio Constitution have been decided by a simple majority vote,"" he wrote. ""The decision to change such a deeply embedded practice should not be made at a low turnout election."" He said such a question belongs on a general election ballot, when there is maximum turnout. But Taft said he also opposes raising the threshold for passing future constitutional amendments at all. Taft noted that two of his own signature initiatives as governor — the Clean Ohio Fund and the Third Frontier Project — would not have been approved under the higher threshold. The former passed with 57.4% of the vote, the latter — after an initial defeat — with 54.1%, he wrote. OHIO LAWMAKER MOVES TO FORCE VOTE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT RULES ""Both measures have stood the test of time, contributing importantly to the economy and quality of life of our state,"" Taft wrote. Taft, governor from 1999 to 2007, also warned that Ohio can't raise its debt limit above $750,000 without a vote of the people. Raising the threshold to 60% could mean that raising the debt limit to fund highway or school construction, environmental protection or job creation programs ""may become impossible in the years to come,"" he wrote. A similar argument was made in January by a coalition of voting rights, faith, labor and other organizations lined up to fight the measure. But Taft's last-minute opposition may do little to deter the 60% measure from moving forward, possibly as soon as this week. Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis said the necessary 60 representatives have committed to voting yes, and that list has been shared with Stephens. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gonidakis let lawmakers know that their votes on the resolution, as well as the bill setting a special August election, will be counted toward their ""pro-life"" records when scorecards are issued at election time, he said. The Buckeye Firearms Association, which supports raising the threshold to 60% to keep Ohioans from passing future gun control amendments, will use the same approach on its gun rights scorecards, Gonidakis said.

"Panel of Democrats, environmental activists blame climate change for whale deaths","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Climate change, spurred by the burning of fossil fuels, is the biggest danger to marine life including whales, a panel of Democratic officials and environmental groups said Monday. The gathering, held in an oceanfront conference room as a half-dozen dolphins frolicked in the ocean behind them, also strongly criticized a bill in the House of Representatives containing numerous incentives for oil and gas companies, and which eliminates several environmental protections currently in effect. It also was a retort to opponents of offshore wind development, who claim that preparation for wind farms off New Jersey and New York are killing whales along the U.S. East Coast. Numerous federal and state agencies say there is no evidence that the deaths are related to offshore wind survey work. MYSTERY OVER WHALE DEATHS SPARKS ALARM: WE NEED TO 'PAUSE AND INVESTIGATE' The event came a week after U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. and other New Jersey Congressional Democrats wrote to the White House Council on Environmental Quality ""demanding real solutions in response to the death of marine mammals off New Jersey’s coast."" But the letter did not seek pause in offshore wind projects as many Republicans demand. Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, two Republican Congressmen from New Jersey, want the work stopped at least temporarily. Neither responded to a request for comment Monday. No Republican elected officials were at Monday's event. Earlier this month, Republican New Jersey state senators Declan O’Scanlon and Ed Durr introduced a resolution calling on the federal and state governments to enact a moratorium on offshore wind preparation, saying ""We cannot ignore the surge in marine life deaths that has occurred while offshore wind project preparation activities have been conducted along the coast."" At Monday's event, Pallone said, ""The science has not linked the whale deaths to offshore wind activities. Climate change is the biggest threat to marine mammals."" Pallone and others said that as water temperatures rise, fish species that whales prey upon have been moving into different areas, bringing whales more frequently into the path of heavily traveled shipping lanes off the East Coast. A panel of environmental activists and Democrat politicians on Monday denied offshore renewable energy projects' potential effects on a recent uptick in whale deaths and beachings off the Atlantic Coast. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry) Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, said the migrating bait fish are ""bringing marine life into direct contact with the shipping superhighway that sits off our coast."" As Ed Potosnak of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters put it, ""They're having a picnic in the Parkway; they're getting hit."" Of the 32 whales that have died off the East Coast since Dec. 1, many have shown signs of being struck by ships or being entangled in discarded fishing gear, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month after a speech at Monmouth University, NOAA's administrator, Richard Spinrad, said ship strikes are a common cause of recent whale deaths. ""We study the fisheries, where the fish are, what the populations are, and there is some thought as to the whales following a change, a shift in where the prey is that the whales feed on, which may be a consequence of a change in the ocean itself,"" Spinrad said. ""By moving further inshore these whales are then more vulnerable to things like ship strikes. The science that we have conducted suggests there is not a link between the activities of offshore wind and the strandings we've seen along the East Coast."" U.S. Sen Cory Booker said burning fossil fuels ""is causing our house to be on fire, and we have been supplying the matches."" NOAA REPORT SAYS NEW JERSEY TURBINES MAY 'ADVERSELY AFFECT' WHALES, BUT DENIES LETHALITY Capt. Paul Eidman, of the group Anglers for Offshore Wind Power, said climate change is already affecting commercial and recreational fishing by changing where bait fish — and their predators — travel. ""Offshore wind energy offers a clean, economical, beneficial opportunity to combat the climate crisis and an alternative to continuing to burn fossil fuels,"" he said. ""We cannot ignore the fact that the impacts of climate change are disrupting species migration and holding patterns, posing serious risks to the long-term future of recreational fishing and the species we rely on.""

Israel arrests Jordanian lawmaker on arms-smuggling charges,"Naftali Bennett spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital about the benefits of AI and the need to set parameters for its use now. Israeli authorities have arrested a Jordanian lawmaker on suspicion of smuggling weapons and gold into the occupied West Bank, Jordan's Foreign Ministry said Sunday. The lawmaker has been identified as Imad Al-Adwan. Jordanian media reports Al-Adwan was arrested Saturday at the Allenby Bridge border crossing while trying to enter the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Foreign Ministry spokesman Sinan Majali said Jordanian officials were following the case ""to find out the merits of the situation and address it as soon as possible."" Fox News Digital has reached out to the Israeli Foreign Ministry for comment. The incident threatens to strain further the tense relations between Jordan and its neighbor Israel.

Conflict-ravaged Sudan attempts 24-hour ceasefire after failed truce,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Terrified Sudanese who have been trapped for days in their homes by fighting in the capital of Khartoum fled on Wednesday, hauling out whatever belongings they could carry and trying to get out of the city, as the military and its paramilitary rival made a new attempt at a 24-hour cease-fire after a failed truce the day before. The new cease-fire attempt came as alarm was growing that millions of Sudanese were on the brink of disaster from the past five days of warfare between the country's two most powerful generals. The fighting grew less intense in the first hours after the cease-fire took effect at 6 p.m., with sporadic clashes continuing in the city center, said Atiya Abdalla Atiya, secretary of the Doctors’ Syndicate, who is still in the capital. But he said neither side has provided guarantees to his group to facilitate movement of health care workers and ambulances. JAPAN TO EVACUATE CITIZENS FROM SUDAN AS INFIGHTING ESCALATES Desperate residents of the capital have been running out of food and other supplies as they sheltered in their homes from the gun battles, bombardment and airstrikes on the streets outside. Hospitals have been damaged and forced to close or have been overwhelmed by wounded, with staff exhausted and medical supplies depleted. Increasingly, armed fighters have turned to looting shops and robbing anyone who dares step outside. Nearly 300 people have been killed in the past five days, the U.N. health agency said, but the toll is likely higher because many bodies lie uncollected in the streets. After the failure of Tuesday evening's truce attempt, hundreds gave up on trying to hold out for calm and fled their homes throughout the day Wednesday, even as explosions and gunfire shook Khartoum and the adjacent city of Omdurman. Residents of multiple neighborhoods told The Associated Press they could see men, women and children leaving with luggage, some on foot, others crowding into vehicles. On Wednesday evening, the army and its rivals, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, separately announced that a new 24-hour truce had begun. Prospects for the cease-fire were uncertain, however, as residents said they continued to hear sporadic shooting and explosions. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called for both sides to stand by a truce, ""renounce violence and return to negotiations."" She said the army and the RSF ""are responsible for ensuring the protections of civilians and non combatants."" Until now, army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and RSF commander Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo — former allies against Sudan's pro-democracy movement — seem determined to crush each other in their struggle for power. The explosion of violence between their forces, which began Saturday, has challenged international efforts to bring calm. Tuesday's cease-fire attempt failed even after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to each general by phone and after pressure from their regional allies. Egypt, which backs the Sudanese military, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have close ties to the RSF, have been calling on all sides to stand down. Throughout the day Wednesday, the two sides battled around the main military headquarters in central Khartoum, which the RSF has tried repeatedly to capture, and the nearby airport. Residents said the military was pounding RSF positions with airstrikes. A satellite image shows destroyed residential and commercial property in Khartoum, Sudan, as military and paramilitary forces attempt a ceasefire in a conflict that has left hundreds dead and thousands injured. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) The army’s monopoly on air power has appeared to give it an edge in fighting in Khartoum and Omdurman, enabling it to take several RSF bases over the past few days. But tens of thousands of fighters from the paramilitary force are fanned out across neighborhoods. Residents say armed men, mostly in RSF uniforms, have raided homes, offices and shops in neighborhoods across Khartoum. ""They roam in small groups from house to house, from shop to shop and loot everything,"" said a resident of the upscale neighborhood of Kafouri in northern Khartoum. ""They storm your house and take all valuable things at gunpoint."" The resident said many families began to take up arms to defend their properties. He and his brother guard their home at night, he said. ""You don’t have another option."" Another resident, in the Arab Market, area said men in RSF uniforms broke into mobile phone shops in the market and looted anything they could carry. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals. Both sides in the conflict have a long history of human rights abuses. The RSF was born out of the Janjaweed militias, which were accused of widespread atrocities when the government deployed them to put down a rebellion in Sudan's western Darfur region in the early 2000s. Darfur has also seen heavy clashes in the past five days. The aid group Doctors Without Borders, or MSF after its French name, said armed men raided its compound in Nyala in Darfur, stealing vehicles and office equipment and looting a warehouse storing medical supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross said its office in Nyala was also looted, with one vehicle taken. Foreigners, including diplomats and aid workers, have also been trapped by the fighting, German media, including the DPA news agency, reported that three A400M transport planes were dispatched to evacuate German citizens from Khartoum, but turned around Wednesday due to security concerns in the city. Japan said it was preparing to send military aircraft to evacuate about 60 Japanese nationals. In Brussels, Dana Spinant, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, confirmed reports that a senior EU official had been shot and wounded in Sudan. Spinant did not provide details. The New York Times identified the official as Wim Fransen, a Belgian national. Separately, gunmen broke into the EU ambassador's residence and assaulted him this week, but a spokeswoman said he is back at work. Hospitals in Khartoum are running dangerously low on medical supplies, often operating without power and clean water, the ICRC said in a statement. Dozens of health care facilities in Khartoum and around the country have stopped functioning because they are close to clashes, the Sudanese Doctors’ Syndicate said Wednesday. At least nine hospitals were bombed, it said. BLOODY SUDAN CONFLICT CONTINUES DESPITE TRUCE, INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ""Our urgent priority is to get medical assistance to hospitals and try to make repairs to their water and power lines so they can treat the wounded,"" said Patrick Youssef, the ICRC's Africa regional director. But fighting has made it impossible to reach the facilities. The U.N.‘s World Health Organization said Wednesday at least 296 people have been killed and more than 3,000 wounded since fighting began, without offering a breakdown of civilians and combatants killed. The Doctors’ Syndicate, which monitors casualties, said Tuesday that at least 174 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded. The conflict between the military and the RSF has once again derailed Sudan’s transition to democratic rule after decades of dictatorship and civil war. A popular uprising four years ago helped depose long-time autocrat Omar al-Bashir. But Burhan and Dagalo jointly carried out a 2021 coup. Both generals have a long history of human rights abuses, and their forces have cracked down on pro-democracy activists. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Under international pressure, Burhan and Dagalo recently agreed to a framework agreement with political parties and pro-democracy groups.

Italian psychiatrist's fatal beating by patient fuels calls for mental health reform,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The fatal beating of a hospital psychiatrist, allegedly by a former patient, has sparked calls in Italy to improve mental health care. Police on Sunday arrested a 35-year-old Italian man for investigation in the attack on Dr. Barbara Capovani. The psychiatrist, 55, was beaten repeatedly with a metal bar on the head Friday when she left work at a hospital in Pisa, northern Italy. On Sunday, doctors at the same hospital declared her brain-dead, and her organs were being donated. Investigators said her attacker was a former patient who later insulted her on social media, and who had had numerous brushes with the law, including beating a doctor in another northern town. ITALIAN POLITICIAN CALLED RACIST AFTER SAYING COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE MORE KIDS INSTEAD OF IMPORTING MIGRANTS The attack on the psychiatrist was the latest in a series of violent assaults on hospital staff in Italy in recent months. Citing her slaying, Italy’s health minister on Monday called a huddle later in the week to move ahead with reforming mental health care. Italys mental health care system has come under fire after yet another professional was assaulted by a patient — this time fatally. Over the last months, the health ministry already began work on how to reform mental health care procedures, Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said in a written statement. ""We must work so what happened to Barbara Capovani doesn't happen again,'' Schillaci said. Under a 1978 law, Italy closed down psychiatric hospitals and made all psychiatric treatment voluntary, with very few exceptions. Critics say the legislation envisioned a network of neighborhood public health facilities to deliver mental health care, but that never fully developed. 3 KILLED IN NORTHERN ITALY AFTER CAR CRASHES INTO FARM SILO According to police, citing surveillance video footage, the alleged attacker waited for the doctor to leave the hospital, but when he didn't see her, returned the next day. When she left and was leaning down to unlock her bicycle to ride home, the man beat her head bloody, inflicting fatal injuries. Health ministry officials thanked her family for allowing her organs to be donated. Colleagues at the Pisa hospital described Capovani, the mother of three children, as very open, sweet, serious and willing take on new patients. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Among incidents in the last year or so was a machete attack on a doctor leaving a Milan area hospital; a psychiatrist in the northern city of Mantua who was beaten with a stick after she deemed a woman didn't need hospital admission; and a doctor at a Naples area hospital who was kicked and punched by relatives of a patient demanding a medical certificate.

Aleksandar Vucic spoke a day after local elections in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo that were overwhelmingly boycotted by the Serb voters there. As a result, ethnic Albanians were elected.

LONGTIME FOES SERBIA AND KOSOVO NEARING NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS ""Our people in Kosovo have shown in which country they want to live,"" said Vucic, the populist leader who is known for his frequent anti-Western outbursts. He is apparently angry at the European Union and the U.S. for allowing Pristina to hold the vote when the Serb boycott, called by Belgrade, was expected.

""The very low turnout, in particular among Kosovo Serb citizens, shows that this process is not and cannot be considered business as usual."" SERBIA, CAUGHT BETWEEN EUROPE AND RUSSIA, COULD MOVE ONE STEP CLOSER TO NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH KOSOVO Kosovo is a majority ethnic Albanian former Serbian province. The 1998-1999 war erupted when separatist ethnic Albanians rebelled against Serbia’s rule, and Belgrade responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people died, mostly ethnic Albanians. In 1999 a NATO military intervention forced Serbia to pull out of the territory. Kosovo declared independence in 2008. Tensions have simmered ever since. Kosovo’s independence is recognized by many Western countries, but it is opposed by Belgrade with the backing of Russia and China.

About 3,000 migrants began marching through southern Mexico Sunday demanding an end to detention centers after a fire at one facility last month left 40 people dead in Ciudad Juárez. The caravan departed from the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the Guatemalan border, Sunday, making their way on foot through the rural state of Chiapas in 95-degree weather, BBC reported. They intend to reach the capital of Mexico City in 10 days. Those participating in the march are said to be primarily from Central America, Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia. Organizer Irineo Mújica told the Associated Press the migrants are demanding the dissolving of the country’s immigration agency, whose officials have been blamed — and some charged with homicide — in the March 27 fire.

Forty-eight million people in West and Central Africa face acute food insecurity in the coming months, a 10-year high spurred by insecurity, climate shocks, COVID-19 and high prices, United Nations humanitarian agencies warned on Tuesday. West and Central Africa has faced increasing risks caused by higher temperatures and erratic rainfall. War in Ukraine has contributed to food and fertilizer shortages in one of the world's poorest regions. The number of people without regular access to safe and nutritious food is projected to hit 48 million during the June-August lean season, according to a regional food security analysis presented by the U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP), humanitarian agency OCHA, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and children's agency UNICEF.

China opts out of UN wildlife survey aimed at preventing future pandemics caused by animals,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. China is not participating in a United Nations project to survey Asian wet markets and other facilities at high risk of spreading infectious diseases from wild animals to humans, despite long-running talks with Beijing, a UN official told Reuters. China's hesitancy to join the UN project involving other Asian nations may compound frustration by global researchers who have been pressing Beijing to share information about the origins of COVID-19, as they seek to prevent future pandemics due to zoonotic, or animal-to-human, disease transmission. Four Asian countries - China, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos - were initially selected for the survey by the scientific advisory committee of the project, called the Safety across Asia For the global Environment (SAFE), because they host multiple facilities presenting risks of animal-to-human disease transmission, the UN official said. FBI DIRECTOR SAYS COVID PANDEMIC 'MOST LIKELY' ORIGINATED FROM CHINESE LAB The selection for the project, launched in July 2021, was also made after major wildlife trafficking cases were detected, investigated and prosecuted in those countries, which increased zoonotic risks, the official said. ""China was initially in discussions to be part of the project,"" the official said, declining to be named as the information was deemed sensitive. The official said discussions with China are still ongoing, but did not clarify with which state institution the UN project is holding talks. China's foreign ministry and the country's National Forestry and Grasslands Administration (NFGA), which oversees the management of wildlife and was involved in initial talks with the project organizers, did not respond to requests for comment. Men walk past a banner hung at the Beijing Zoo on Feb. 10, 2020.

China has decided not to participated in a UN wildlife survey aimed at preventing future pandemics due to zoonotic transmission.  (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang) The official said NFGA initially showed interest in the project but eventually declined to join, saying it was not under its remit. The agency did not indicate which government agencies would be responsible for the matter, the official said. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which monitors illegal wildlife trafficking and coordinates the SAFE project, had no immediate comment. After a strain of coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, many researchers suspected it spread in a live animal market there. China has since banned the sale and consumption for food of wildlife animals. Despite the ban, experts warn risks still remain. HOUSE GOP TO REQUIRE BIDEN TO DECLASSIFY INFO ON WUHAN LAB, COVID ORIGINS ""There are glaring holes in the restrictions that still pose a zoonotic disease risk,"" said Peter Li, China Policy Specialist for Humane Society International, a Washington-based non-profit organization. He said China still allows wildlife breeding on a massive scale for fur trade, traditional medicine, pet trade and for entertainment or display in low welfare conditions. China's public security organs have handled more than 70,000 criminal cases involving wild animals from 2020-2022, confiscating 1.37 million wild animals in the process, state news agency Xinhua has reported. The country's revised wildlife law, designed to close regulatory loopholes, is due to take effect in May, according to the National People's Congress website. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Slow Start The SAFE project surveys only began in October last year, when the project's assessors visited Khao Kheow zoo and a cafe in Thailand. Another dozen surveys have been conducted in the country since then. The goal is to boost pandemic prevention and preparedness, the official said, noting the results of the surveys would be solely shared with the participating governments. After China effectively dropped out from initial talks, it was replaced with the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island, according to the list of participating countries posted on the official website of the project. About 40 facilities in each participating country are to be surveyed to identify potential risks of disease transmission. The facilities to be surveyed include restaurants, wet markets, biomedical supply facilities, zoos and breeding facilities. The wet markets targeted are markets where wild animals are sold alongside fresh meat and vegetables. Vietnam and Laos have yet to approve the surveys. The UN official expected the formal greenlight from the two countries over the coming weeks or months. Malaysia's Sabah has authorized the field visits. A second UN official, from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which implements the project, said practices that can increase disease transmission risks include lack of hygiene, mixing of different animal species and the use of overcrowded cages. The project, which is funded by the European Union and will run until July 2024, could be expanded to involve the World Health Organization (WHO) if public health considerations are identified, the first UN official said.

LAURA INGRAHAM: This party has gone insane. Now, Democrats used to pride themselves on being the working-class party. But somewhere along the way, they decided to sell out to Wall Street and give the shaft to Main Street. These Bush-style Democrats became the Forever War Party, and they bought off the progressive silence by promising to also go to war with conservatives at home. Remember how they laughed at Mitt Romney in 2012 when he warned about Russia's reemergence? And now they have us bogged down in a proxy war against Russia that Ukraine is not winning.

"Don Lemon became 'embarrassing distraction' for CNN, lost newsroom with endless antics: Insiders","The network announced it parted ways with the longtime host on Monday. Don Lemon said he was shocked at his firing by CNN Monday, but insiders say it was a long time coming for the embattled host whose 17-year tenure came to an abrupt end after months of controversies. Just hours after what ended up being his final broadcast on the network, Lemon announced on Twitter that he had been terminated and found out through his agent. To put a stamp on what was no longer a tenable relationship, CNN essentially called one of the faces of its network a liar, saying Lemon's account was ""inaccurate."" ""When you are demoted, reprimanded and sent to manner class - and still don't learn your lesson, the logical next step is termination,"" one CNN insider told Fox News Digital. While things hadn't looked bright ratings-wise for Lemon over the past several years, the beginning of the end was in February when he made misogynistic comments about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, saying she was past her ""prime"" at 51 years old. Lemon was forced to issue multiple apologies and CNN boss Chris Licht, in a rare public rebuke of an employee, ordered him to take ""formal training."" Don Lemon was fired by CNN on Monday after 17 years at the network. (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for THR) Last week on ""CNN This Morning,"" Lemon had a fiery argument with another 2024 hopeful, Vivek Ramaswamy, who clashed with him over comments Ramswamy made about the freedoms of Black Americans in the post-Civil War era. Lemon said his comments were insulting, sparring with Ramaswamy for several minutes as his visibly uncomfortable co-host Poppy Harlow could be seen shifting in her chair and even reading on her phone. At another point in the discussion, Lemon snapped at a producer to stop talking in his ear. The New York Times suggested Monday that Lemon's latest on-air antics were linked to his firing, saying it had exasperated members of CNN leadership. ""That is the latest example of what he has been warned about,"" the insider said, who thought the incident would have been swept under the rug. DON LEMON FIRING FROM CNN LINKED TO EXPLOSIVE ON-AIR EXCHANGE WITH VIVEK RAMASWAMY; GOP HOPEFUL REACTS The insider said despite whether Lemon had the facts on his side in his debate with Ramaswamy, Lemon's ""browbeating"" over an ideological difference may have cost him his job. Don Lemon's heated on-air spat with GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy last week was cited as a factor in the CNN host's firing.

""Considering all the factors, the situation seemed untenable,"" the source told Fox News Digital. Lemon was the subject of relentless bad press in recent months, the worst of which was his Haley remarks and badly received efforts to atone for them. His move to mornings from primetime last fall was met with disastrous ratings. Then came tabloid reports on off-camera spats with his co-hosts Kaitlan Collins and Harlow, including one incident where he ""snapped"" at Collins for having interrupted him on air, leaving her visibly upset. Finally, a bombshell exposé from Variety documented years-old accusations of Lemon's misogyny towards female CNN colleagues.

"Some doctors providing trans procedures to minors consider quitting, retiring as GOP pressure mounts: report","Former transgender kid, Chloe Cole, shares the complications she deals with every day as a result of medical interventions she was subjected to after being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. ""I'm not sure whether it'll even go away,"" she said. Some physicians, frustrated by state GOP bans on gender reassignment procedures for minors, are considering quitting their jobs and retiring early, according to a Sunday report in Politico. Most recently, North Dakota’s Republican Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill into law that immediately made it illegal to provide sex change operations to minors. Other states with bans on transgender treatment for children include Florida, Georgia, Missouri and more than 10 others. Politico interviewed doctors in states with bans or restrictions on medical interventions on minors, which includes surgeries, hormones and puberty blockers – also called gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH). GnRH is also used for patients with testicular cancer. Politico reported, ""While some doctors, especially those early in their careers, said the bans have inspired them to work harder and continue providing this kind of care, others who are older said they have considered quitting or retiring early — though they acknowledge doing so would make it even harder for their patients to receive care."" Gender-affirming care has been called ""life-saving"" by multiple medical associations. Its critics raise concerns about the long-term effects on the minor cohort, of which there is limited research, and the ability to consent.  (Adobe Stock ) NIH STUDY RECRUITING 18-YEAR-OLDS TO LEARN 'UNKNOWN' SIDE EFFECTS OF TESTICLE REMOVAL FOR GENDER DYSPHORIA Physicians also complained about harassment and threats, according to Politico.

""The threats, the harassment, the constant fear of, ‘Did I say that right? Is that OK? Should I have said that differently? Did I present my position in a public space as effectively as possible, and also did I say anything that is going to get my family targeted in some way?’"" she wondered.

""It affects the families in the states where care is banned, and it affects the families in the states where the care is not.""’ Proponents of ""gender-affirming care"" for minors say it is ""medically necessary"" and a ""life-saving"" treatment for a population with an extremely high rate of suicide.

""We are increasingly alarmed that HHS’ advocacy has led health professionals to prescribe dangerous and experimental drugs and surgeries to troubled children — in many cases covered with taxpayer dollars,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Don Lemon firing from CNN linked to explosive on-air exchange with Vivek Ramaswamy; GOP hopeful reacts,"GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and CNN's Don Lemon had a heated argument about the Civil War and the history of Black American gun rights. Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy sounded off on Don Lemon's firing from CNN, which was allegedly linked to a contentious on-air exchange the two of them had last week on ""CNN This Morning."" Lemon fueled a fiery spat with Ramaswamy for comments the 2024 hopeful made about the freedoms of Black Americans in the post-Civil War era, which Lemon claimed ""insulted"" him as a Black American. In its reporting on Lemon's firing, The New York Times suggested the morning show blow-up was linked, saying, ""The incident left several CNN leaders exasperated,"" per sources. CNN FIRES DON LEMON, LEAVING LONGTIME ANCHOR ‘STUNNED’ Ramaswamy said, ""It's clear"" their exchange ""played in role"" in what he called a ""sound decision"" by CNN in an interview with Fox News Digital Monday. ""I think that any network that wants to foster open debate should embrace that principle by not restricting what someone can say or saying what someone can say is restricted based on their skin color.

He also speculated CNN's firing of its longtime liberal host is a sign that ""we're on the cusp of national cultural revival,"" recalling Netflix's decision to stand behind Dave Chappelle's comedy special following uproar from staffers, telling Fox News Digital he's hoping CNN ""may be going through similar kinds of cultural transformation.""

""This is also why I, unlike many other people in my position, go out of my way to engage in dialogue with those who disagree with me, including networks outside of conservative media, because I think it's important to air what otherwise are the hypocrisies that don't get aired.

Newly-formed nonprofit seeks to buy most of Maine newspapers,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

What Grimes' AI music offer could mean for the future of the industry,"Duke law and philosophy professor and author Nita Farahany says the challenge for humans with quickly developing artificial intelligence is the ethical and legal constraints around it. As controversy swirls around the use of famous artists' vocals for AI-generated music, Grimes seems to be embracing the use of artificial intelligence in the music industry. In a tweet Sunday, the 33-year-old Canadian singer, whose real name is Claire Elise Boucher, said she is happy to have her voice featured on AI-simulated music tracks as long as she is compensated with royalties for successful songs. AI-GENERATED SONG USING DRAKE AND THE WEEKND VOCALS GOES VIRAL, RAISING LEGAL CONCERNS ""I’ll split 50 [percent] royalties on any successful AI generated song that uses my voice,"" Grimes, who shares two children with Elon Musk, tweeted. ""Same deal as I would with any artist i collab with. Feel free to use my voice without penalty. I have no label and no legal bindings."" Grimes made the offer in response to a headline about a fake AI generated Drake and Weeknd song ""Heart on My Sleeve"" that went viral over the weekend and was uploaded to Spotify. The song, which used the stars' vocals and was created by a TikTok user utilizing AI software, prompted significant questions about copyright, compensation and the mounting legal implications of AI's role in music creation. While Drake had no comment on this new single, he previously shared his thoughts about AI on Instagram. ""This is the final straw AI,"" he shared when an AI-generated clip of him singing Ice Spice's ""Munch (Feeling You)"" surfaced.

""Can AI be an author? Is AI a co-author? Is AI an artist? Is the art that is created in fact art? Are we going to be able to tell the difference between what is real and what is not real? And how our brains be able to detect those differences. What is the role of creators and humans going forward?

Blinken's alleged role in 'Russian disinfo' Hunter letter disqualifies him as Ukraine war pointman: critics,"Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe sounds off on 'The Story.' Allegations then-Biden campaign adviser Antony Blinken was the ""impetus"" behind the letter signed by 51 current-or-former intel officials that claimed Hunter Biden's laptop bombshell had the hallmarks of a ""Russian information campaign"" should preclude him from representing the United States in any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, critics said Monday. Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe recounted on ""The Story"" how, after people like Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., declared the laptop story a Kremlin smear campaign, he intently contradicted such claims publicly. ""The only intelligence Adam Schiff had is the intelligence that I've shared with him, and the intelligence community doesn't have any that indicates this is a Russian disinformation campaign,"" Ratcliffe said, adding he declined to say at the time he knew the FBI had the laptop's contents in its possession – because he also did not want to prejudice the future first son's legal rights. At the time the letter was published in Politico, Ratcliffe said former acting CIA Director Mike Morell – whose testimony before House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, reportedly identified Blinken as the impetus behind the letter – knew that the intelligence community, under Ratcliffe, already declared the laptop not to be disinformation.

""They obviously did it as an effort not just to win the election, but to mislead voters about the truth. They suppressed the truth and they and they amplified a lie,"" he said. In a time of less discordant politics, Ratcliffe added, Blinken would face bipartisan calls to resign his current post. Additionally, given the allegations, Blinken should not be trusted as America's top diplomat in any negotiations between Russia and their foes like Ukraine, he said.

Americans spending up to $85k to bulletproof cars as crime surges: 'Uncertainty... has become a major concern',"Founder and CEO of Armormax Mark Burton discusses the demand for bulletproof cars among surging crime in liberal cities. As crime takes hold of U.S. cities, Americans are taking drastic measures to protect themselves and their families by spending tens of thousands of dollars to bulletproof their cars. Founder and CEO of Armormax Mark Burton explained how his clientele has evolved from the world's most wealthy to everyday Americans in recent years during ""Fox & Friends. ""Ten years ago, it was the richest of the rich that were mainly concerned about their business,"" Burton told Todd Piro Monday, ""Today, that's gone down the economic pyramid. You have doctors, you have lawyers, you have real estate agents, you have developers, you have the… average Joe, I can say, that are spending some money to protect themselves in their vehicles."" ONE OUT OF EVERY 179 AMERICANS WILL EVENTUALLY BE MURDERED IF CRIME RATE CONTINUES, STUDY FINDS On the high end, Americans are spending up to $85,000 to have their car completely bulletproofed. The price tag, which Burton explained depends on the model of the vehicle, can also be tailored accordingly if a client wants just portions of the car bulletproofed to include certain windows and/or doors. Some Americans are getting their cars bulletproofed for a 'peace of mind' amid surging crime, founder of Armormax Mark Burton says ""They're looking for peace of mind,"" Burton said. ""It's almost like an insurance policy. They hope they never have to use it. But… if those experiences occur, or those incidences occur, then they're safe."" Burton noted the evolving clientele has happened over the course of the last year and a half, noting surging violence in major cities as a driving force for the shift. MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS ""The change started occurring about 18 months ago,"" Burton said. ""At the time we were doing about 85% of our business here in the United States for overseas customers, and now that has completely flipped. The uncertainty that exists in the United States today, and in particular in some of the larger cities, has increased that demand."" New Orleans closed out 2022 with a decades-high homicide record and unseated St. Louis as America’s ""Murder Capital."" It recorded 52 homicides per 100,000 residents. St. Louis, which has long been ranked and considered one of the country’s most dangerous cities, had 45 homicides per 100,000 residents that same month. Crime in New York City also made headlines in 2022, despite a decline in murders and shootings. As those violent crimes fell, robberies, burglaries, felony assault, grand larceny and other crimes continued in the city, spurring major crimes to increase by 22% compared to 2021. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Overall homicides in large U.S. cities were down about 5% in 2022 compared to 2021, when murders in large cities hit a 25-year high. ""We have the West Coast.

""We get calls, multiple calls, and we get multiple sales every week from those two principal areas. But it's the larger metropolis type of areas where the crime has increased tremendously.""

Miranda Devine calls for intel officials to lose security clearances over false claims about Hunter laptop,"New York Post columnist Miranda Devine discusses the expected meeting between Hunter Biden's attorneys and Justice Department officials. New York Post columnist Miranda Devine called for security clearances to be stripped from all 51 former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming the stories about Hunter Biden's laptop were Russian disinformation. On ""America's Newsroom"" Monday, Devine accused the intel officials of abusing their authority and said Biden used the letter as a ""get out of jail free card"" in his final presidential debate against Donald Trump. REPUBLICANS RESPOND AFTER IRS WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS HUNTER BIDEN INVESTIGATION IS BEING MISHANDLED MIRANDA DEVINE: It's just bombshell on top of bombshell. And you're right. The revelation that the Biden campaign – specifically now-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when he was a campaign senior adviser – reached out to a high-ranking former acting director of the CIA and got him to organize this letter, claiming falsely that the stories we published from the laptop were Russian disinformation. Those 51 former intelligence officials are really at fault. … And they should have their security clearances stripped. They abused their former higher authority. They did not do any due diligence. They peppered the end of the letter with weasel words so that they could have plausible deniability now, but it doesn't wash. They saw how that letter was handled by the media as they intended, by calling it Russian disinformation, reducing our reporting, and they never spoke up. John Brennan and the rest of them fanned out across the left- wing media and kept on saying drumbeat after drumbeat, ‘This is straight from the Kremlin.’ And of course, a couple of days later, Joe Biden used that letter to get out of jail free effectively at the last debate against Donald Trump. Very effectively. It worked. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Hunter Biden (Getty Images) A former CIA official testified that then-Biden campaign senior adviser, now-Secretary of State Antony Blinken ""played a role in the inception"" of the public statement signed by current and past intelligence officials that claimed the Hunter Biden laptop was part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell testified before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, and revealed that Blinken was ""the impetus"" of the public statement signed in October 2020 that implied the laptop belonging to Hunter Biden was disinformation. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, sent a letter to Blinken Thursday, notifying him that the panels are ""conducting oversight of federal law-enforcement and intelligence matters within our respective jurisdictions."" In October 2020, weeks before the presidential election, dozens of ex-national security officials signed onto a letter claiming that Hunter's laptop had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."" The former officials included former Obama CIA Director John Brennan, former Obama DNI James Clapper, and former CIA director, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, among others.

"Chicago must rehire, pay back wages to workers punished over COVID-19 vaccination mandate: Judge","Restaurant owner Leonardo DeFranco and executive director of the Fulton Market association Roger Romanelli joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the new mandate. An Illinois judge ruled that the city of Chicago must rehire and pay back lost wages of unionized city employees who were fired or disciplined for violating COVID-19 vaccination requirements. Administrative law judge Anna Hamburg-Gal, writing on behalf of the Illinois Labor Relations Board, said that the city ""failed and refused"" to bargain in good faith with union leaders ""over the effects of its decision to implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate."" The decision applies to unionized city of Chicago employees working as carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, machinists, and other job categories. Affected employees must also be paid back lost wages and benefits with 7% annual interest, according to the ruling. Illinois judge ruled Chicago must hire and pay back workers fired over COVID-19 vaccination requirements. (iStock) LORI LIGHTFOOT ACCUSED OF IGNORING ‘SOCIAL CONTRACT’ WITH POLICE BY LOWBALLING COVID DISABILITY BENEFITS In 2021, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced all city employees must be fully vaccinated. She warned there would be ""consequences"" for any city employee who wasn't fully vaccinated by that October. ""Employees who fail to report their vaccination status by October 15, 2021, will be placed in a non-disciplinary, no pay status,"" a press release stated at the time. Lightfoot's mandate was not well received by workers, some of whom loudly booed her while speaking at a union fundraiser later that month. Those unions celebrated the most recent ruling.

""At issue in this case is whether an employer has an obligation to bargain over significant changes to terms and conditions of employment."" However, the mayor's office blasted the mandate repeal in a statement. ""The record before the Administrative Law Judge tells a completely different story. Yesterday's ruling was an erroneous decision that does not follow the law, facts nor importantly the science. We are currently reviewing the ruling and evaluating next steps,"" a representative for the mayor's office stated to Fox News Digital. Lightfoot's current term ends on May 15.

Nikki Haley taunts CNN's Don Lemon over firing: 'A great day for women everywhere',"The network announced it parted ways with the longtime host on Monday. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley isn't sad to see the departure of Don Lemon, who was suddenly terminated by CNN just hours after his final on-air appearance Monday. While CNN's official statement said that Lemon and the network ""parted ways,"" the embattled liberal anchor alleged he found out about his dismissal through his agent and took a swipe at CNN's leadership. A spokesperson disputed Lemon's statement as ""inaccurate."" Haley reacted to the stunning media news by taking a not-so-veiled shot at Lemon, promoting her ""Past My Prime?"" campaign koozies featuring cans of ""lemonade."" CNN FIRES DON LEMON, LEAVING LONGTIME ANCHOR ‘STUNNED’ ""A great day for women everywhere. Now, let's get men out of women’s sports. #StillInMyPrime,"" Haley tweeted. Don Lemon was fired by CNN on Monday, leaving him ""stunned."" (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for THR) Haley's tweet was an overt reference to Lemon's controversial remarks in February when he claimed that the 51-year-old GOP hopeful was past her ""prime"" as she advocated for politicians over 75 to take a mandatory cognitive test. Lemon's comments were universally panned. Lemon's CNN colleagues fumed over his remarks, and he was the target of mockery from Biden spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre during a White House briefing. The controversy even made its way to this year's Oscars ceremony. Best Actress winner Michelle Yeoh told women in Hollywood, ""Don't let anybody tell you you are ever past your prime.""

Lemon, who had previously hosted a poorly-watched two-hour solo show in primetime, was pulled by Licht for a revamped morning show with co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, something he had repeatedly insisted was a ""promotion."" But like his primetime stint, his new program was met with dismal ratings.

Don Lemon and his ""CNN This Morning"" co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins were the subject of tabloid news over reports of off-air dust-ups. (Mike Coppola/Getty Images for CNN) Following what ended up being his final appearance on ""CNN This Morning"" on Monday, Lemon took to Twitter with the shocking revelation that he was fired by the network. ""I was informed this morning by my agent that I have been terminated by CNN. I am stunned,"" Lemon wrote. ""After 17 years at CNN I would have though that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network. It is clear that there are some larger issues at play.""

Marc Thiessen warns GOP against 'forcing' a 2020 rematch on voters: 'Get out of jail free card' for Biden,"Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how voters are sending a 'very clear message' regarding the 2024 presidential election. A Trump-Biden rematch in 2024 would be a ""get out of jail free card"" for President Biden one analyst warned, as the president is expected to launch his second bid for the White House this week. Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen argued a rematch with the veteran duo would get him off the hook for the ""serial disasters"" he has spurred while in office during ""America's Newsroom"" on Monday. ""Voters are sending a very clear message. They want different choices. They don't want a Trump-Biden rematch,"" Thiessen told Bill Hemmer Monday. ""So what happens if we force them to have that Trump-Biden rematch? Well, the Wall Street Journal poll last week has the answer. It said that among voters who disapprove of both Biden and Trump, Biden wins by 54 to 15%. So what that means is swing voters who dislike Joe Biden dislike Trump even more."" BIDEN EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE REELECTION BID SAME WEEK HUNTER'S LAWYERS MEET WITH DOJ ""So if we force that, the problem for the Republicans is to win the election, they've got to get the all those voters who disapprove of Joe Biden to vote for the Republican nominee, and Donald Trump is like a get out of jail free card for Joe Biden for all the political consequences of his serial disasters in office that we should be wrapping around his neck… like an albatross,"" he continued. Biden's re-election announcement is expected to take place on Tuesday through a pre-taped message, despite a bombshell new poll indicating a majority of Americans do not want him to seek a second term in office. According to the survey from NBC News, 70% of Americans, including 51% of Democrats, do not think Biden should run for re-election, with 26% supporting the president. Almost half of the respondents who voted no cited Biden's age as their ""major"" concern with Biden running again – 48% categorized their concern as ""major"" while 21% said it was a minor concern; 29% of respondents said the issue of his age did not pose a reason in their logic whatsoever. WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD SAYS BIDEN SHOULDN'T RUN IN 2024: 'HIS DECLINE IS CLEAR' Biden is currently the oldest president in U.S. history. He would be 82 years old during his potential second inauguration, and 86 years old at the end of a second term. But Thiessen doubled down on Biden's political record as motivation for what critics have called dismal polling amid the widespread concerns surrounding his age and mental fitness. ""Joe Biden is literally the most unpopular president in the history of polling since it's going back all the way to Harry Truman, and he… had the best midterm performance of any president going back to John F. Kennedy except for Bush after the 9/11 attacks,"" Thiessen said. ""That wasn't because voters approved of Biden, it's because they disapproved of the alternative, because we put up so many of these nominees who… their number one qualification was echoing Trump's election denial,"" he continued. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Thiessen argued that if Republicans choose a candidate other than Trump, voters can hold Biden accountable for the ""disasters"" he has caused through his demise at the ballot box. ""If Republicans choose somebody other than Trump – and don't get me wrong, he was a great president – but he's he's made himself toxic to those swing voters,"" Thiessen said. ""If we choose somebody else, then… we can make Biden own all of the disasters he's unleashed on the southern border, on the economy, on inflation, on gas prices. That's the way to make him own it.""

Morris also drew attention to the Tennessee debate over drag shows after she told the state to ""f---ing arrest"" her when she also invited drag queens on stage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other states, including Idaho, Kentucky, North Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma and Utah, are considering similar bans on drag performances. Lawmakers in Arkansas recently passed a bill in that puts new restrictions on ""adult-oriented"" performances. While initially targeting drag shows, that bill was scaled back after complaints of discrimination. Fox News’ Julia Musto contributed to this report.

"CNN fires Don Lemon, leaving longtime anchor 'stunned'","A look back at some of the host’s controversial segments over the last eight years as ""Don Lemon Tonight"" comes to an end. CNN's embattled anchor Don Lemon has been fired, he announced Monday. Lemon posted a statement on Twitter to reveal that he had been terminated, calling himself ""stunned"" and expressing anger that he hadn't been contacted directly. ""I was informed this morning by my agent that I have been terminated by CNN,"" Lemon said. ""I am stunned."" CNN CEO Chris Licht said in a memo that Lemon and the network had parted ways. ""Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish him luck and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors,"" Licht wrote. CNN and Don Lemon have parted ways, the network announced Monday. A ""stunned"" Lemon said he had been fired. (Screenshot / CNN / CNN This Morning) CNN'S DON LEMON ACCUSED OF EXTENSIVE MISOGYNY, SENDING THREATENING TEXTS TO FEMALE COLLEAGUE: REPORT Lemon, who had been with CNN for 17 years, has been at the center of various scandals in recent memory but apparently didn’t think his time at the network was coming to an end. ""After 17 years at CNN I would have thought that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network,"" Lemon wrote. ""It is clear that there are some larger issues at play."" Lemon then thanked his now-former colleagues. ""They are the most talented journalists in the business, and I wish them all the best,"" Lemon said. CNN pushed back on Lemon, saying his account was ""inaccurate."" ""Don Lemon's statement about this morning's events is inaccurate,"" its communications team wrote in a statement. ""He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter."" Last year, Lemon was pulled from his prestigious solo primetime gig to an ensemble morning show alongside co-anchors Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, but he insisted the move wasn’t a demotion. In fact, he went on CNN and said Licht offered him a ""promotion."" It didn’t take long for ""CNN This Morning"" to make tabloid news after the show's launch in November. On Dec. 8, during CNN's breaking news of Brittney Griner's release from Russia, there were multiple on-air instances in which Collins attempted to interject while Lemon was speaking. At one point, Lemon wagged his finger above the desk and told her ""stand by one second."" While off-air, however, Lemon got ""nasty"" at Collins, scolding her for interrupting him, which left her ""visibly upset,"" a source who witnessed the exchange told Fox News Digital. The New York Post first reported on the incident, causing headaches for CNN bosses. Lemon found himself in hot water again in February for saying that Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley was past her ""prime"" at age 51, citing Google as his source while stunning his female co-anchors in the process. Lemon offered a mea culpa during the network's editorial call the next day, but female colleagues weren’t pleased. DON LEMON SPOTTED AT THE BEACH AFTER PHONING IN APOLOGY TO CNN COLLEAGUES OVER SEXIST NIKKI HALEY COMMENTS Don Lemon has a long history of controversial rhetoric. He was fired by CNN on Monday. (CNN screenshot) Colleagues were further enraged when Lemon was spotted at Miami Beach after the insensitive remarks about Haley. Lemon was then ordered to take ""formal training,"" but he returned to his struggling morning show a few days later. A CNN insider told Fox News Digital in February that Lemon had ""no defenders"" inside the network over the situation and everyone was still ""pissed."" If he were forced out, ""it would probably be welcomed by a lot of people,"" they said at the time. ""I think there's an array of people who maybe like him personally, not professionally."" Lemon's ""prime"" comments were universally panned and not just by conservatives, receiving mockery from Biden spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre during a White House briefing and even making its way to this year's Oscars ceremony. Best Actress winner Michelle Yeoh told women in Hollywood, ""Don't let anybody tell you, you are ever past your prime."" Those remarks were hardly the first time Lemon’s on-air rhetoric sparked backlash among female viewers. In 2014, he infamously asked a Bill Cosby accuser why she didn’t simply bite his penis to prevent an alleged rape. Last September, he asked CNN analyst S.E. Cupp if she was suffering from ""mommy brain"" after she lost her train of thought during a panel discussion. In December, Lemon clashed with his female ""CNN This Morning"" co-hosts while arguing male athletes make more money than women because ""people are more interested in the men."" DON LEMON'S 'PATHETIC' APOLOGY FOR SEXIST REMARK SPARKS EVEN MORE FURY INSIDE CNN: ‘F-----G A--HOLE’ Don Lemon appears to have noticed a photographer who spotted him on vacation in Miami Beach while he was engulfed in controversy. (MEGA / GC Images / File) His recent streak of alienating female viewers comes after years of alienating conservative audiences, which was encouraged when CNN was run by Jeff Zucker, who was forced out of the network last year. Lemon, one of CNN's most openly left-wing voices, has compared Trump supporters to Ku Klux Klan members, defended Antifa, and fumed over people unvaccinated against coronavirus ""taking up the space"" in hospitals, among other news-making moments. CNN INSIDERS SAY DON LEMON HAS 'NO DEFENDERS' AT THE NETWORK, NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE TO KEEP ON-AIR Earlier this month, Variety published a bombshell report that revealed scandalous allegations about Lemon. The allegations included claims he sent threatening text messages to a colleague from a burner phone and repeatedly exhibited misogynistic and ""diva-like"" behavior. At the time, CNN defended Lemon and called the report ""riddled with patently false anecdotes"" and ""based on unsourced, unsubstantiated, 15-year-old anonymous gossip."" Licht, who has been on a crusade to ""tamp down spectacle"" at CNN, initially kept Lemon around during a housecleaning that saw polarizing hosts such as Brian Stelter exit. ""CNN This Morning"" failed to resonate with viewers and suffered through ratings woes throughout Lemon’s run. It’s unclear who will replace him on CNN’s morning show. Fox News’ Joseph A.

CNN insider says staffers 'pissed' at network spending reported millions on Gayle King for weekly show,"'Gutfeld!' panelists discuss CNN's Don Lemon returning to his morning show after he made sexist comments about Nikki Haley. It was 16 months ago that CNN had a consistent programming lineup in primetime, something that is virtually unheard of in cable news. While trouble has been widespread for CNN as its viewership has significantly decline since President Trump left office, there has been panic for content in primetime after its scandal-plagued but highest-rated anchor Chris Cuomo was fired in December 2021. The content void further expanded when its poorly-watched host Don Lemon, who had a two-hour block in primetime, was pulled by CNN boss Chris Licht for a new morning show, which has only spawned additional headaches for the network. There has been a revolving door of fill-in hosts for the 9 p.m. ET vacancy from Jim Acosta to Jake Tapper, while Licht tapped Alisyn Camerota and Laura Coates to lead programming at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET respectively in recent months. CNN'S CHRIS LICHT SAYS HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR ‘ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY’ BECOMING CEO: A ‘SMACK IN THE FACE’ The only constant throughout the chaos has been ""Anderson Cooper 360"" in the 8 p.m. ET time slot, a program that frequently is not CNN's most-watched on a daily basis despite being in primetime. The content void further expanded when its host Don Lemon, who had a two-hour block in primetime that languished in the ratings, was pulled by CNN boss Chris Licht for a new morning show, ""CNN This Morning."" The show saw poor ratings but plenty of tabloid drama, and CNN fired Lemon on Monday, leaving the longtime anchor ""stunned."" ""Anderson Cooper 360"" remains as CNN's only permanent fixture in primetime but its ratings have continued flailing in recent years. (CNN) Recent developments show weeknight programming remains in flux. Coates is reportedly being pulled from the 11 p.m. ET slot due to lack of staff budgeting, leaving Camerota to do double duty from 10 p.m through midnight. And CNN also announced that ""Who's Talking to Chris Wallace?"" will be moving from Sundays nights at 7 p.m. to Friday nights at 10 p.m. ""This is just the latest shuffling of the deck chairs on the CNN Titanic,"" one former CNN producer told Fox News Digital. CNN INSIDERS BAFFLED WHY NETWORK STANDS BY DON LEMON AS CONTROVERSIES MOUNT: ‘ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYSTERIES’ Over the past several months, reports of CNN courting outside talent to solve their primetime debacle had emerged. CNN confirmed over the weekend that CBS News' Gayle King and NBA legend Charles Barkley will be teaming up for a weekly primetime show aptly titled ""King Charles,"" set to air on Wednesday nights this fall. Barkley, who confirmed talks with the network were taking place in February, called CNN a ""s--- show"" and signaled he would ""never"" do a daily show. TNT basketball analyst Charles Barkley is set to host a weekly primetime show on sister network CNN, which he openly referred to as a ""s--- show."" (Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports) CNN staffers were particularly irked at reported rumors that King, who previously worked with Licht when he was the executive producer of ""CBS This Morning,"" would receive a whopping $12 million salary for hosting one hour per week. The network has had significant budget cuts over the past year and also went through a wrenching round of layoffs at the end of 2022. ""People are pissed,"" one CNN insider told Fox News Digital. FOX NEWS VIEWERSHIP CRUSHES MSNBC, CNN FOR 110TH STRAIGHT WEEK AMONG BOTH TOTAL VIEWERS AND PRIMETIME A spokesman for CNN forcefully pushed back at the $12 million price tag that has been floated in the tabloids, calling that figure ""totally laughable"" and suggesting it was much lower. Another CNN insider was also chagrined at Coates, a Black woman who is also a legal analyst at the network, not having her own show, calling her well-liked and a team player. They predicted people at the network will be ""up in arms"" if the network doesn't do more to address diversity in primetime beyond a one-day-a-week show with King and Barkley. ""I hope management sees it the same way and we avoid a big bruhaha. We’ve had and continue to have enough of them,"" the insider said. The King-Barkley pairing, though, is a small antidote for CNN's primetime woes as it addresses only one hour of content on one weeknight instead of all five weeknights. It marks Licht's boldest programming move to date but in a memo to staff, he stopped short of declaring it a permanent solution for CNN by saying the show will air ""beginning this fall and running into 2024,"" perhaps giving him wiggle room to chalk it up as another primetime experiment in case it becomes another ratings dud. CNN staffers are ""pissed"" about the reported multi-million-dollar contract the network is offering CBS anchor Gayle King to host a show one night a week despite major budget cuts. (Michele Crowe/CBS via Getty Images) As CNN struggles to restore its primetime programming, Licht seemed to throw in the towel in landing a permanent host to save the network five nights a week, at least in the short term. In February, the network shifted its pitch to Variety, which ran the headline ""CNN Bets News, Not Big Names, Will Capture Crowds at 9 PM."" The premise was that the news would be the real star in primetime through town halls, high-profile interviews and other specials rather than a single TV personality to be the face of the time slot. But so far they have failed to juice CNN's ratings. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP In March, CNN averaged only 539,000 total viewers in primetime compared to Fox News' 2.1 million average and MSNBC's 1.2 million.

Utah State Sen. Mike Kennedy (R) joined ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss the incident Monday, saying he was out of town when the vandals struck, adding that his neighbors helped by cleaning up some of the mess in his absence.

"WSJ blasts Blinken, intel officials, media for spreading 'false' Hunter Biden laptop letter","Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the possible charges he could face as the investigation into the president's son continues.

""Intelligence officials, former as well as current, have a particular duty not to spread disinformation because they have access to classified information that the public can’t check. The press overwhelmingly went along with the false Biden campaign claims because it wanted Mr. Biden to win.

Authorities are facing mounting pressure to unveil the Nashville school shooter's manifesto to shed light on the motive behind the brutal massacre that left six people, including three children, dead last month. The FBI has been accused of stalling its release after officials reportedly found 20 journals, five laptops and a suicide note among other things at the shooter's home. The suspect, Audrey Hale, identified as trans and was a former student at The Covenant School before she carried out the deadly shooting last month. Sen.

The State House later voted to expel Jones and Pearson – but the duo were later essentially reinstated after the Shelby County Council and Nashville Metro Council respectively voted to place them in the newly-open seats. ""Certainly it was a stunt that took place on the floor of the Tennessee Senate. The bullhorns, all of the racket-making, they knew what the rules were,"" Hagerty said. ""But again, this just turned into something that I think the White House can make some political gains on. At least that's their calculation."" ‘TN THREE’ DEMOCRAT JUSTIN JONES PICTURED STANDING ON COP CAR DURING 2020 BLM PROTEST ""I wish they would instead focus on the victims of this horrendous murder,"" he continued. Fox News' Peter Doocy pressed White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the topic last week, asking her if any of the shooting victims' families had been invited to the White House. ""Monday, you're going to have three of the lawmakers who protested,"" Doocy said. Jean-Pierre interrupted him, noting they were ""peacefully"" protesting. ""Who peacefully protested after the Nashville Covenant School shooting,"" Doocy continued. ""Have any of the victims or the victims families been invited to the White House?"" ""I don't have anything to read out to you about any invite,"" Jean-Pierre replied. Hagerty accused the Biden administration of being more focused on sculpting the ""narrative,"" as opposed to the reality of the situation. ""We've got an administration in the White House that's far more focused on press releases, spin and politics than they are on substance and reality,"" Hagerty said.

Matt Taibbi rips media silence after Dem threat: 'Can you imagine' if GOP threatened to jail CNN’s Jim Acosta?,"Twitter Files journalist Matt Taibbi speaks out on Fox & Friends about his minor mistake that prompted Democratic Rep. Stacey Plaskett to threaten him with prison time. Independent journalist Matt Taibbi, who was threatened with jail time by a top Democrat on Capitol Hill over testimony he gave about his reporting on the Twitter Files, feels the media would have lost its minds if Republicans did the same to CNN's Jim Acosta. ""Can you imagine if something like this had happened in the Trump years? If Republicans had threatened someone like Jim Acosta with five years in prison over a minor error? That he didn’t even make in testimony before Congress? You would have had every human rights organization on earth complaining about it but not a peep from my so-called colleagues in mainstream media,"" Taibbi said Monday on ""FOX & Friends."" ""It doesn’t matter what journalist it is, they should be upset about it because it could be them next,"" Taibbi added. Del. Stacey Plaskett, D-Virgin Islands, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, sent a letter to Taibbi earlier this month regarding his testimony during a March 9 hearing, which she alleged included an error regarding the name of one of the federal agencies swept up in the Twitter Files. She cited MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan's contentious interview with Taibbi on the matter. Independent journalist Matt Taibbi was threatened with jail time by a top Democrat on Capitol Hill over testimony he gave about his reporting on the Twitter Files.

The error was a specific reference to CISA, the government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, when he meant to refer to CIS, the Center for Internet Security, which is a private organization. Taibbi later addressed and corrected the error in his reporting. Plaskett pointed to Taibbi's statement in her letter, writing it is ""contradicted by your own admission."" JOURNALIST MATT TAIBBI THREATENED WITH PRISON TIME FOR PERJURY BY TOP DEMOCRAT OVER TWITTER FILES TESTIMONY ""This mistake is important because, by adding an ‘A,' you weren't making a harmless spelling error. Rather, you were alleging that CISA — a government entity — was working with the EIP [Election Integrity Partnership] to have posts removed from social media,"" Plaskett wrote to Taibbi, according to a letter obtained by journalist and fellow Twitter Files reporter Lee Fang on Thursday. ""When presented with this misinformation, you acknowledged you had made ‘an error’ by intentionally altering the acronym CIS and you subsequently deleted your erroneous tweet."" Plaskett continued, ""Prior to your appearance before the subcommittee on March 9, you signed the Judiciary Committee's Truth in Testimony form, certifying that you understand that ‘knowingly providing material false information to this committee/subcommittee or knowingly concealing material information from this committee/subcommittee, is a crime (18 U.S.C. 1001). In addition, at the beginning of the March 9 hearing, you swore ‘under penalty of perjury that the testimony you [were] about to give [was] true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief.' Under the federal perjury statue, 18 U.S.C. 1621, proving false information is punishable by up to five years imprisonment."" Democratic Congresswomen Stacey Plaskett and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz both questioned journalist Matt Taibbi during a House hearing on March 9, 2023.  (House Judiciary ) But as Fang noted in his reporting, the specific comments Taibbi told Congress that Plaskett cited ""were correct"" despite the original error in his Twitter Files reporting. Taibbi called his error a ""brain cramp"" and noted both that both groups actually partnered with state entities. CNN’s Oliver Darcy did not mention the threats against Taibbi in his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter that covers the media industry and often frets about attacks on journalists. Darcy and liberal media colleagues have been largely dismissive of the Twitter Files reporting; at one point, several left-wing reporters were left embarrassed when they used clearly coordinated language to accuse Taibbi on Twitter of doing ""PR work"" for the ""world's richest man.""

In 2018, Acosta was serving as CNN’s senior White House correspondent when the Trump-era White House had his press pass suspended. While he wasn’t facing anything close to jail time, the media industry largely rallied around him. Acosta’s ""hard pass,"" which provides expedited access to the White House grounds, was suspended after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a press conference, at one point refusing to pass the microphone to a female White House aide. His pass was restored after CNN argued that it violated the network and Acosta’s First and Fifth Amendment rights. Acosta, who how hosts a staunchly left-wing weekend program for CNN, emerged as one of the most outspokenly liberal White House reporters during the Trump era, earning a book deal in the process. He was criticized by colleagues for a showboating style that was heavier on style than substance.

Lizzo protests Tennessee policy by bringing drag performers on stage: 'Celebrate our differences',"Country star Maren Morris told her over 1.6 million fans on Instagram that she took her young, two-year-old son to meet drag queens in an unapologetic video. Grammy-award winning pop star and social activist Lizzo invited drag performers on stage in Tennessee after the state became the first in the nation to ban such performances on public property and near schools. ""In light of recent and tragic events and current events, I was told by people on the internet, ‘Cancel your shows in Tennessee,’ ‘Don’t go to Tennessee,'"" Lizzo said during her performance. ""Their reason was valid, but why would I not come to the people who need to hear this message the most?"" ""The people who need to feel this release the most?"" Lizzo said to cheers in the crowd. ""Why would I not create a safe space in Tennessee where we can celebrate drag entertainers and celebrate our differences and celebrate fat, Black, women?"" the singer added.

(Robert Okine/Getty Images) Tennessee became the first state to ban drag shows on public property and near schools. The law, which takes effect on July 1, criminalizes performances that take place in public or where they could be seen by children. The bill prohibits ""adult cabaret performances"" from taking place within 1,000 feet of schools, public parks or places of worship, according to The Hill. The legislation builds on existing restrictions on ""adult-oriented businesses"" in Tennessee, expanding obscenity laws there to include performances that feature topless or exotic dancers or ""male or female impersonators"" that provide entertainment appealing ""to a prurient interest."" LIZZO PROMOTES ABORTION RIGHTS IN 'SIZE INCLUSIVE' LINGERIE LINE: 'MY BODY IS NOBODY'S BUSINESS' Lizzo performed in Knoxville, Tennessee over the weekend. (Henryk Sadura via Getty Images) One popular drag performer who goes by the stage name ""Aquaria"" responded directly to Lizzo's Instagram post on her performance. ""Thank you so much for the platform for me and the drag race girls and especially for uplifting the queens on Tennessee! Those ladies are all so strong and brave and I know tonight was definitely the best of a tricky situation for everyone. Thanks for shedding light for our friends who definitely need our hand these days. We appreciate it,"" the drag performer wrote. Several other states, including Idaho, Kentucky, North Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma and Utah, are considering similar bans on drag performances. The governor of Arkansas recently signed a bill that puts new restrictions on ""adult-oriented"" performances. While initially targeting drag shows, that bill was scaled back after complaints of discrimination. The Tennessee drag show ban was temporarily blocked in March by a federal judge. Lizzo also shouted out Sesame Street character Elmo during her performance, with the popular children's show puppet making an appearance. Elmo's official Instagram account later commented on Lizzo's post, writing that he felt ""special"" for being able to speak during Lizzo's performance.

Another liberal diversity lie: FCC Democrats won't give these minorities a fair hearing,"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Biden will prioritize diversity when selecting a new Fed Vice Chair. Liberal leaders never miss an opportunity to declare their commitment to diversity. From college admissions to collective bargaining and beyond, the mantra for most Democrats has been the more diversity the better. But that only goes so far. When the opportunity arose for the Democratic-led FCC to approve a merger of what would become the largest minority-owned local television group, it has failed tragically. President Biden's FCC and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been instrumental in delaying bid by  Korean American entrepreneur Soohyung (Soo) Kim to buy Tegna Broadcasting. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Over one year ago, Korean American entrepreneur Soohyung (Soo) Kim made an application at the FCC to buy Tegna Broadcasting in a deal worth $8.6 billion. Tegna is America's third-largest broadcast group, with over 64 television stations in 51 markets throughout the United States. Under Soo, Tegna would become the largest minority-owned broadcast station group in the country. BIDEN'S FCC NOMINEE SUPPORTED BY GROUP THAT CALLED POLICE ‘AGENTS OF WHITE SUPREMACY’ Little did he know that despite the historical legacy of such an undertaking, not everyone would be cheering him on. In fact, Soo gravely underestimated the deep reservoir of bias, enmity and discrimination he would face as an Asian American entrepreneur – that is until the liberal long-knives came out publicly against him. Up to now, Soo's business career has been the stuff of American Dream novels. Born in South Korea. Immigrating to the United States at the age of 6. Learning English by watching ""Sesame Street."" Studying hard to gain admission to Princeton. Working his way up on Wall Street to become a successful investor, and ultimately founding his own hedge fund under the unassuming name, Standard General. Self-styled ""public interest groups,"" a few representatives of labor unions and lawmakers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren coalesced to oppose the application. (Stefani Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images) Today, Soo Kim can claim major investment successes in retail, real estate, gaming and media. Even so, putting together significant debt and equity financing to take the publicly-traded Tegna private is no small feat for any entrepreneur – minority or not. With a solid plan to improve local news and faith in the fairness of the regulatory process, Mr. Kim believed the merger would be approved by the FCC within the customary 180-day window in which the agency acts. But not so fast. While Soo Kim is no stranger to opposition, and has had his fair share of contested deals, the Tegna merger marked the first time the entrepreneur had encountered the federal government's stonewall of silence. From the moment Standard General's plans were announced, a collection of self-styled ""public interest groups"" and a few representatives of labor unions coalesced to oppose the application. Together they, along with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., prevailed upon the FCC to see things their way. According to the Wall Street Journal, Pelosi acted after receiving substantial campaign contributions from a Democratic donor who was interested in derailing the Standard General deal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks to the media at the U.S. Capitol, Oct. 25, 2022. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Things have been anything but normal since. AMERICA'S TIKTOK CHALLENGE IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK For the better part of a year, the Democratic-led FCC has successfully delayed an up or down decision on Mr. Kim's merger application. It has extended the period of review, made repeated requests for the same set of documents, and even refused to meet with the principals involved in the deal to discuss conditions or concerns. In what could have been the coup de grace after a year of regulatory run-around, an FCC bureaucrat, acting under delegated authority from the FCC chairwoman, referred the merger to an internal administrative law judge for further review. What makes this last act of merger malfeasance so problematic is that the FCC knew Mr. Kim's financing commitment for the deal had been extended several times, but would come to a hard stop on May 22. Referring the merger application for a hearing normally takes up to a year and in most cases means the kiss of death for any deal. The commission's patent disdain and disregard for commercial and financial realities in the industry it regulates is appalling. When Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, learned of these shenanigans, they raised the red flag. In a joint letter to FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, Cruz and Rodgers wrote the following: ""The Media Bureau’s decision to send the transaction to an ALJ hearing violates Commission rules and precedents in several ways. ""First, to keep the Commission accountable to Congress and the public, a full Commission vote is required for certain matters, particularly those involving novel issues and/or significant legal or policy consequences. Designating a multi-billion-dollar transaction such as the Standard General-TEGNA transaction for an ALJ hearing is precisely the type of serious decision for which commissioners must take responsibility. The last time the FCC referred a major transaction to an ALJ, the decision was made at the Commission level, and the FCC should not have departed from that precedent. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers speaks during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill on March 23, 2023. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER ""Second, the Media Bureau’s HDO relied on novel interpretations of the Commission’s public interest standard and appeared to ignore – if not contradict – the Commission’s precedent that ‘an increase in retransmission consent rates, by itself’ does not constitute a public interest harm. ""Third, under Commission precedent, the Media Bureau should have provided the full Commission 48 hours’ notice before issuing the HDO on February 24, 2023. It did not."" Cruz and Rogers have not been the only ones to cite the FCC's departure from precedent and procedure. There is a long and impressive list of local legislators, civil rights leaders, acadamic scholars and trade associations that have written in support of the merger, including the American Enterprise Institute and American Consumer Institute. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There has been a travesty committed by Democratic leaders in this Standard General-Tegna deal. While they have consistently given lip-service to media ownership diversity, their actions speak louder than words. In a completely private transaction that does not burden taxpayers, involve public funds or harm competition, liberals have shown an amazing amount of hubris and hypocrisy. When it comes to media ownership and meaningful participation in America's economy it appears the FCC Democrats have built a rampart with the sign: ""Minorities need not apply.""

BBC responds to 'Great Expectations' BDSM scene: 'Reading between the lines',"The Five co-hosts discuss a British publisher pushing for more inclusive language in Roald Dahl’s classic childrens books. Charlotte Moore, the chief content officer of BBC, defend her network’s choice to feature a BDSM scene in the mini-series adaptation of Charles Dickens’ ""Great Expectations."" Viewers were recently shocked by a scene in the second episode that featured the character Mr. Pumblechook being spanked over a bed by Mrs. Gargery. Amid viewers and fans of the original novel criticized this scene and other dark moments in the show, Moore stated that she ""believes absolutely everything [in the show] comes from what was alluded to"" ""[Y]ou have to really understanding what [Dickens] would have felt able to write about [in the Victorian era] and read between the lines,"" Moore told the Broadcasting Press Guild in London on Thursday. A general view shows the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Television Centre in west London. (REUTERS/Toby Melville) When asked why the network decided to adapt the classic novel in this way, Moore responded, ""Because I think it’s a great way to bring loved texts to new audiences, and to find new interpretations,"" and that it can ""push the boundaries of storytelling,"" and ""reinvent [classic novels] for a modern age."" NEW ADAPTATION OF CHARLES DICKENS’ ‘GREAT EXPECTATIONS’ RIPPED FOR BDSM SCENE: ‘UNWATCHABLE’ The show also portrayed the character Miss Havisham, played by Olivia Coleman, as an opium addict. In an interview with the BBC, the show’s screenwriter Steven Knight similarly defended the creative choice by claiming that Dickens was restricted by the elements of his time. ""You couldn’t write about certain things in Dickens’ time: certain elements of sexuality, crime, disobedience against the crown and state. What I tried to do was imagine if Dickens was writing the story now and had the freedom to go to those darker places, what would he do? If he had been liberated to write the things that were going on that he wasn’t allowed to write about,"" Knight said. An employee at Sothebys holds an 1843 first edition of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens in London, U.K., Tuesday, December 5, 2006. (Photo by Suzanne Plunkett/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Regarding the scene itself, Knight also defended the racy undertones, arguing for a deeper reading into the text. ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 19, 1843, CHARLES DICKENS PUBLISHES ‘A CHRISTMAS CAROL’ ""So I think if you take a microscope to the text of Dickens – for example, Pumblechook and Mrs Gargery, there are a couple of lines in there where they disappear together,"" Knight said. ""And I think that a Victorian readership were a bit more forensic about what was going on."" The Dickens Fellowship, however, criticized this reading as a way to ""generate viewership"" by shocking the audience. Honorary General Secretary Paul Graham referred to Knight as ""disingenuous"" while calling his argument ""slightly ridiculous.""

Christian university blocks Maoist China survivor from speaking over anti-woke views: 'Extra concerning',"Survivor of Mao’s Revolution Xi Van Fleet and Virginia father of four Joe Mobley slam state Democrats for opposing a bill to teach the history of communism and react to a school board member calling Iwo Jima ‘unfortunate’ The student government at Whitworth University denied a Republican group's request to invite Xi Van Fleet, a survivor of Maoist China, to speak on campus, citing her criticism of ""woke culture"" and her comparisons of the ideology to her experience under communist rule. The student government at Whitworth University, a private Christian university in Spokane, Washington, voted 9-4 to reject the Turning Point USA chapter’s request to host Van Fleet during a meeting on April 12, arguing that her positions, represented by her tweets critical of woke culture, could be deemed ""hurtful or offensive,"" Campus Reform reported. The Virginia mother, who endured Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution before immigrating to the U.S., has emerged as an outspoken opponent of critical race theory and frequently warns about similarities she sees between the ""woke revolution"" and her experience living under Mayo Zedong's Chinese Cultural Revolution, including the suppression of opposing viewpoints.

"Guns, fear and the media: Experts explain the shifting gun culture in America","Dr. David Yamane and Dr. Kevin Gilliland dissect the evolution of gun culture in the U.S. and how recent shootings have created an increased fear of guns on ‘Sunday Night in America.’ Guns have always been a central feature of American culture. However, over the years the culture surrounding gun usage has shifted. Sociologist Dr. David Yamane and psychologist Dr.Kevin Gilliland explain on ""Sunday Night in America"" how the uptick in senseless violence across America has created a heightened sense of fear and an increased need for self-defense in Americans. ""I think we have to start by recognizing that guns have always been a fairly normal part of American culture. But the reasons that people owned guns have evolved over time and people have always had firearms for self-defense,"" Dr. Yamane said, going on to explain how the ""core"" of American gun culture has seen an evolution motivated by self-defense. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS AMERICANS FOR GUN SAFETY ""In the past 30 to 40 years, the self-defense motivation has really moved to the core of American gun culture. So this is what I call gun culture 2.0, the second evolution of American gun culture. Not everybody owns guns for self-defense, but a lot of people do,"" he said. On the topic of the fear surrounding guns and the increased importance of self-defense, Dr. Gilliland highlighted the role of the media and social platforms creating a heightened sense of concern surrounding violence.

So what we did is what we look for in those,"" he said, discussing the effect these sources have on people's psyche. ""And the more you fill your head, your psyche, and the more you read and watch, the more you get disrupted, and you feel far more vulnerable. And now fear and anxiety and worry starts to make choices, including protecting yourself,"" Dr. Gilliland continued, addressing how social media does not only impact adolescents negatively but adults as well.

New York Times admits Biden should take 'concerns about his age seriously',"Former D.C. Democratic Party Chair Scott Bolden and former John Boehner aide Terry Holt joined Fox News Live to discuss the upcoming announcement ahead of the presidential election. President Biden needs to ""take voters’ concerns about age seriously"" before campaigning for his second term, the New York Times editorial board wrote on Saturday. The editorial acknowledged that ""many Democrats, particularly younger ones, are worried that he will simply be too old to be effective in a second term"" citing a poll that showed only 47% of Democrats want Biden to run again. More concerning, the article noted, was the Biden administration’s hesitation on the topic of his age, despite Biden’s plans to announce his second term on Tuesday. ""Concerns about age — both in terms of fitness for office and being out of touch with the moment — are legitimate…But Mr. Biden has given voters very few chances to do just that — to watch him — and his refusal to engage with the public regularly raises questions about his age and health,"" the editorial board wrote. U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce his campaign for president on Tuesday. ((Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)) In previous articles, New York Times writers have remarked that Biden’s age as a ""sensitive topic"" and ""uncomfortable issue"" regarding the president. Though the editorial board claimed that Biden’s State of the Union address presented an ""effective defense"" for critics of his age, appearances like that, the editors wrote, are rare. WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD SAYS BIDEN SHOULDN’T RUN IN 2024: ‘HIS DECLINE IS CLEAR’ ""He has held fewer news conferences and media interviews than most of his modern predecessors. Since 1923, only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan took fewer questions per month from reporters, and neither represents a model of presidential openness that Mr. Biden should want to emulate. His reticence has created an opening for critics and skeptics,"" the New York Times wrote. The article follows an editorial from the Wall Street Journal that argued Biden’s decline from his old age was ""clear to anyone who isn’t willfully blind"" from his lack of press conferences. President Biden would be 82 years old in 2024. (Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""The public understands what Mr. Biden apparently won’t admit: that electing an octogenarian in obvious decline for another four years could be an historic mistake,"" the Jouranl editorial board wrote. Biden would be 82-years-old if he wins a second term and currently holds the record as the oldest president to ever hold office. Over the past few years, multiple media outlets have expressed doubts about Biden’s ability to run again due to his age. ABC’S TERRY MORAN ‘SENSES’ MOST AMERICANS DON’T WANT ’81-YEAR-OLD RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT’ ""If Mr. Biden runs again, as he recently said he intends to, questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job,"" the Times editorial stated. ""If he runs again, Mr. Biden will need to provide explicit reassurance to voters; many of them have seen family members decline rapidly in their 80s. Americans are watching what Mr. Biden says and does, just as he has asked them to do."" Mainstream media outlets have shown concerns over President Biden's age ahead of 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP More recently, ABC's Terry Moran acknowledged on ""This Week"" that voters are likely reluctant to support Biden for his age. ""My own sense is that most Americans don’t want to vote for an 81-year-old running for president, neither do they really want to vote for a 77-year-old running for president. They'd like to go to the next generation. And I think part of the modesty is the Biden White House operation aware that people are uneasy with his age,"" Moran said.

A November 2022 survey from the Ronald Reagan Institute found trust and confidence in the U.S. military stands at 48%, down from 70% in November 2018. The primary reason for the more than 20-point decline was the ""perceived politicization of the military,"" according to a press release from the organization. TOP GUN MAVERICK: NAVY, AIR FORCE LOOK FOR RECRUITMENT BOOST FOLLOWING BIG OPENING FOR TOM CRUISE SEQUEL (Fox News) A second survey also found only 13% of 18-29-year-olds are ""highly willing"" to join the military. Twenty-five percent are ""somewhat willing"" and 26% are ""not willing at all."" Sarraille argued one reason so few Americans are unable to serve is because of health reasons. ""I think it should send shockwaves through America that we've lowered our standards to such depths. We're in a culture where everyone gets a trophy. Obesity is the new beautiful,"" he explained on ""Fox News Live."" ""And if you fail or don't even try- don't worry- it's somebody else's fault. When you look at leadership, strong leadership, leadership that people respect and trust, they're willing to contribute and sacrifice for the collective good. Now, the juxtaposition to that is weak leadership, the crisis of confidence [where] people pull inward to protect themselves and their immediate families. And they're not willing to sacrifice for the cause they deem unworthy,"" he continued. ""But I'm not going to put this on the younger generation. If we can actually get them into the military, we can actually get them to a physical standard that they need to be. This generation is the next best generation. We just have to hold them to the standards of old."" (Fox News) NORTH CAROLINA MAN, ONCE OBESE, INSPIRED BY NAVY SEAL TO QUIT DRINKING, GET FIT AND RADICALLY ALTER HIS LIFE The military officer added that the U.S. needs to start training the younger generation to be the leaders the country needs for the future. ""I think a good sort of contrast here is there was a commercial by the Russians where they showed young men resolute, ready to do violence on behalf of their nation. And then the contrast to that is the U.S. Army that showed a video of a young soldier and her two mothers,"" he said. ""We're sending some very dangerous narratives. We have to have pride in our nation."" Air Force recruiters are seen at the Hyundai Air & Sea Show in Miami Beach, Florida, in May 2022. (Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Sarraille shared that joining the military was the greatest decision he ever made because it helped him grow from a young boy into a man and laid the foundation for his success. Co-host Eric Shawn highlighted the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) program and how it is disproportionately offered in the southern part of the country. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sarraille said that he grew up in the Bay Area but it ""outlawed"" the JROTC program. ""They outlawed JROTC within the high schools, within the immediate San Francisco city,"" he explained. ""So, again, we've got to be very wary about the message we're sending to our youth as well as our enemies abroad."" Ashley Carnahan is a production assistant at Fox News Digital. ",629,media
Netflix's 'Cleopatra' director defends Black casting: ‘What Bothers You So Much About a Black Cleopatra?’,"The massive tunnel was previously hidden beneath a temple 40-feet below the ground just west of Alexandria, Egypt. (Credit: Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities via Storyful) ""Queen Cleopatra"" director Tina Gharavi penned an article for Variety that pushed back against the accusations of ""blackwashing"" the historic figure after it was revealed that Cleopatra would be played by a Black actress. The Netflix series faced intense backlash after the first trailer for the latest season of ""African Queens"" featured Cleopatra portrayed by Adele James, a dark-skinned actress. Gharavi remarked on this backlash, calling the comments that she faced as ""laughable."" ""While shooting, I became the target of a huge online hate campaign. Egyptians accused me of ‘blackwashing’ and ‘stealing’ their history. Some threatened to ruin my career — which I wanted to tell them was laughable. I was ruining it very well for myself, thank you very much! No amount of reasoning or reminders that Arab invasions had not yet happened in Cleopatra’s age seemed to stem the tide of ridiculous comments. Amir in his bedroom in Cairo wrote to me to earnestly appeal that ‘Cleopatra was Greek!’ Oh, Lawd! Why would that be a good thing to you, Amir? You’re Egyptian,"" Gharavi wrote. Egyptian archeologists discovered a tunnel some believe could lead to the tomb of Cleopatra (Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities via Storyful) She acknowledged ""what a political act it would be to see Cleopatra portrayed by a Black actress"" but insisted that ""what the historians can confirm is that it is more likely that Cleopatra looked like Adele than Elizabeth Taylor ever did."" NETFLIX’S ‘QUEEN CLEOPATRA’ ADAPTATION SUED BY EGYPTIAN LAWYER: A ‘FORGERY’ ""Why shouldn’t Cleopatra be a melanated sister? And why do some people need Cleopatra to be white? Her proximity to whiteness seems to give her value, and for some Egyptians it seems to really matter,"" she wrote. Despite that claim, many Egyptians have similarly attacked the portrayal as historically inaccurate. On Wednesday, Egyptian lawyer Mahmoud al-Semary filed a lawsuit against Netflix for the series, calling for an investigation into Netflix management as well a block on the streaming service in Egypt. ""Most of what Netflix platform displays do not conform to Islamic and societal values and principles, especially Egyptian ones,"" the complaint read. Netflix was sued by an Egyptian lawyer for the portrayal of Queen Cleopatra in an upcoming series. (Netflix) Gharavi wrote that she has ""asked Egyptians to see themselves as Africans,"" and mourned that ""they are furious."" However, she notes that she is ""okay with this,"" alleging that this perspective was influenced by ""the internalized white supremacy that Hollywood has indoctrinated"" into audiences over time. MADONNA COMPARED TO CLEOPATRA, QUEEN ELIZABETH I FOR TRYING TO LOOK YOUTHFUL ""It’s almost as if we don’t realize that misogynoir still has an effect on us today. We need to liberate our imaginations, and boldly create a world in which we can explore our historical figures without fearing the complexity that comes with their depiction,"" Gharavi wrote. She continued, ""I am proud to stand with ‘Queen Cleopatra’ — a re-imagined Cleopatra — and with the team that made this. We re-imagined a world over 2,000 years ago where once there was an exceptional woman who ruled. I would like to draw a direct line from her to the women in Egypt who rose up in the Arab uprisings, and to my Persian sisters who are today rebelling against a brutal regime.

""We don’t often get to see or hear stories about Black queens, and that was really important for me, as well as for my daughter, and just for my community to be able to know those stories because there are tons of them!

Professors forced into retraction on 'false' research accusing employer of pervasive racism,"Dr. Phil hosted an episode about the morality and practicality of sending reparations to the Black descendants of slavery in the United States. University of Minnesota academics were forced to retract an article they wrote about ""structural racism"" at the institution because its claims were ""inaccurate, misleading, or false,"" according to a note on the withdrawn article. The article in question was written in the journal of Health Services Research by UM employees with doctoral degrees who focus on racial equity: Stuart Grande, a senior lecturer, Janette Dill, an associate professor, and Tongtan Chantarat, a research scientist. Retraction Watch, a blog that reports on retractions of scientific papers, first reported that the piece was withdrawn months after the original publishing date. The research probed into the university's diversity, equity and inclusion policies (DEI) at the Division of Health Policy and Management that were implemented after George Floyd's death at the hands of police in 2020. DIVERSITY PROFESSOR VERBALLY ATTACKS STUDENT AFTER BEING TRIGGERED BY TERM 'TERRORIST ATTACK': COMPLAINT University of Minnesota academics who wrote an article that accused the institution of ""structural racism"" have retracted the piece. (Adobe Stock) The paper labeled some of their employer's efforts as simply ""performative."" ""An important theme … is that current DEI work within … departments is often ‘tokenistic’ or performative rather than substantive or aimed at structural change [to combat racism],"" the article said. ""Performative DEI work is identified as planning activities, committee work, task force initiatives that are not backed by meaningful actions,"" the article continued. ""Many of these activities are disingenuous, such as … website placement of photos of racialized faculty, students, or staff, or sweeping claims about commitment to racial justice."" The authors solicited feedback from staff and students at the university, some who said they were exhausted with the DEI initiatives and others who said there was pervasive racism at the University of Minnesota.

Bill Maher questions why Chicago's crime wave isn't addressed: 'Why are you killing each other?',"""Real Time"" host Bill Maher discussed the Black-on-Black crime issue that plagues cities like Chicago and criticized how it isn't addressed by Democrat leaders. ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher called out the lack of attention to high Black-on-Black crime rates in cities such as Chicago during his show on Friday. Hosting a panel with Brown University economist Glenn Loury and international relations scholar Daniel Bessner, Maher questioned the rise in crime in major cities and why it has not been addressed. ""Like Chicago, most of the shootings are young Black men killing other young Black men. Is that not correct?"" Maher asked. After Loury confirmed it was true, Maher continued, ""OK, much more than what the cops do. Why doesn't anybody talk about that? Why aren't there a hundred giant Black celebrities, who would have the respect of those people, saying, ‘What are you doing to yourselves? Why are you killing each other?’"" HBO host Bill Maher blasts failures to address crime waves in cities like Chicago. (HBO) CHICAGO’S LORI LIGHTFOOT SLAMMED OVER CRIME PIVOT FOLLOWING OUSTING: ‘TOO LITTLE TOO LATE’ Although Chicago's Mayor-elect Brandon Johnson has condemned criminal activities such as the ""Teen Takeover"" of the streets on April 15, he criticized people for ""demonizing"" their violent behavior. ""It is well past due we put an end to this dynamic. Look, demonizing children is wrong. We have to keep them safe as well,"" Johnson said in a speech on Thursday. Loury similarly criticized the failure of Democrat politicians such as Johnson to address and properly handle crime in their cities.

(AP Photo / John O'Connor / File) ""In order to get a majority of the voters in Chicago, or any place else, to get behind anything that is going to cost them, they have to feel safe. They have to feel that the people in charge are on their side. And that's why Mayor-elect Brandon Johnson needs to come and give speeches saying this is contemptible behavior, we won't tolerate it in our city. The reason why we have cops is precisely in order to stop this from happening and if you do it on my watch you're going to go to jail,"" Loury said. BILL MAHER HANDS OUT ‘COJONES AWARDS’ TO THOSE WHO FOUGHT AGAINST CANCEL CULTURE MOB Maher went on to criticize suggestions that more financial investment in the city would fix the issue. ""One in 3 children in America cannot read at a basic level of comprehension. Eight-five percent of Black students lack proficiency in reading skills,"" he said. ""We already spent a lot of money on schools. So, are you going to keep telling me that more money will fix this because I feel like this is much more connected to the problems of people who can't read. Yes, they're going to have problems with gainful employment, and it seems like, you know, a lot of times the solutions that come from the left seem symbolic.

Psaki has dessert in 'hard-hitting interview' with former boss: 'Doesn’t ask tough questions either',"Senior Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the House GOP investigation on whether Biden climate envoy John Kerry's discussions with China might undermine the U.S. economy and foreign policy. U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry and former White House press secretary Jen Psaki chatted about the dire state of the planet and ""Forrest Gump"" over ice cream Sunday on Psaki’s new MSNBC show. Psaki, who served as Kerry’s spokesperson at the State Department during the Obama administration, introduced the segment on ""Inside with Jen Psaki"" by saying she caught up with Kerry ""on the National Mall for a wide-ranging discussion and a little dessert."" The discussion remained very light, with Kerry recalling his mother’s influence on his environmental activism and him praising younger generations for leading the fight on climate change. Immediately after Kerry declared ""the planet is at risk,"" Psaki suggested an ice cream break. -- ""It sounds kind of highfalutin, probably, to say that, but the planet is at risk. I mean, it is at risk,"" Kerry said.

""Every time I’m around here I always think of him screaming to Jenny in the pool over here."" At the end of the brief segment, Kerry and Psaki did a ""cheers with Dove bars.""

We now have nine and counting Biden family members who were zinged by at least one bank for receiving suspicious wires from our adversaries around the world. …Through our informants and through our research over the past year and through other investigative reporting, we thought there were around a dozen of these LLCs that were created by Biden family members to disguise or launder where the source of the revenue was coming from. But there are many more LLCs. There are many more Biden family members, many more LLCs, and many more countries that were involved… the question remains, what were these family members doing to receive this money?

North Carolina educators tout 'My Place in Race' DEI workshop for middle schoolers: 'Important for all ages',"DEI efforts are expanding at universities across the country. A race-based workshop in an Asheville-area North Carolina middle school was touted as ""important for all ages"" to discuss diversity, equity and inclusion in light of America's tense racial climate, but some argue the instruction could divide more than unite. Teachers at Evergreen Community Charter School hosted the workshop on Friday where discussions of diversity and inclusion led the event. Discussions also focused on the history of race and how the subject should be taught. ""These are hard issues,"" Jennifer Watkins, associate director at the institution said, according to ABC 13 in Asheville. ""It’s hard for people to understand different perspectives. But one key thing we really need to do is to practice having discussions.""

""It's important for all ages, from kindergarten to three-year-olds to grown folks to middle schoolers to be having conversations about racial equity and race in our country,"" she said. The notion raises concerns among those who allege the content incites division and perpetuates some controversial principles found in critical race theory, a system of thought that observes the way power structures and systems – namely government and corporations – disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. OPINION: ‘RACISTS ANONYMOUS’ IS JUST ONE OF THE INSANE WAYS UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA HAS BEEN CONQUERED BY DEI Critical race theory – a school of thought dedicate to observing the systemic oppression of racial and ethnic minorities – continues to divide educators, administrators and parents. (Getty Images) The allegedly ""racist"" ideology has become increasingly widespread in recent years, infiltrating top medical schools, K-12 schools, as well as private schools and other university departments across the U.S. Some argue, though the conversations may be appropriate for older students, others are too young. Among those concerned is the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank who alleged the workshop would create a victim mentality centered around inherent characteristics such as race and gender. ""[The theory] replaces Marx’s conception of class struggle with an oppressor/oppressed dynamic based on identity groups, such as race and gender,"" the foundation argued, according to ABC 13. COLLEGE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OFFIICERS RAKE IN SKY-HIGH SALRIES AS DEBT-SADDLED STUDENTS FACE RISING COSTS DEI has similarly taken center stage in the education wars as many public schools and universities implement DEI-focused programs or hire DEI officers who rake in lucrative salaries. Such positions gained national attention in recent weeks, most notably at Stanford University, where a DEI Dean Tirien Steinbach confronted Trump-appointed judge Kyle Duncan as protests broke out during his talk on campus. Other DEI-focused initiatives have led institutions to question gender norms, advocating for differential recognition between gender and sex as well as calling for enhanced inclusion among minority groups in school and work settings.

McCarthy accuses Biden of ignoring GOP over debt ceiling negotiations as talks stall: 'Rests upon his feet',"Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss Republicans' proposal and why Biden's action is 'risky' as the battle over government spending continues. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy demanded President Biden return to the negotiating table for debt ceiling negotiations, as talks remain stalled over key spending cuts and a potential increase to the ceiling overall. McCarthy accused the president of stifling a deal during ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" after Biden dismissed the Republican spending proposal as ""wacko"" and ""irresponsible."" ""I think as president and the leader of the free world, this is one of the problems,"" McCarthy told Maria Bartiromo. ""We have challenges around this country, around the world. He needs to show leadership and come to the negotiating table instead of putting us in default. This is risky, what he's doing."" ""He's threatening the markets. Think of his ideas in the next month. If you actually have good credit, you pay more. If you have bad credit, you get a discount. Who believes in these types of ideas?"" he continued. ""This goes against everything, what America was created upon that if you work hard, you can succeed, and that's the difference. Come to the table, negotiate and do what is right.""WALL STREET SHOULD BE 'CONCERNED' ABOUT DEBT LIMIT STANDOFF WITH BIDEN: MCCARTHY McCarthy and other House Republicans unveiled a plan last week to cut government spending in various ways while also raising the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion. The plan would slash spending for the IRS, Democrats' green energy agenda, and unused COVID-related funding. But McCarthy said the president has yet to respond to House lawmakers about the proposal. ""This rests upon his feet, not because he made a bad decision. The real decision is he's afraid to even negotiate,"" McCarthy said. HOUSE WILL VOTE SOON TO CAP FEDERAL SPENDING AT 2022 LEVEL, RAISE DEBT LIMIT FOR ONE YEAR: MCCARTHY Biden addressed the GOP-led proposal last week, dismissing it as ""wacko"" and shifting blame as negotiations remain at a standstill. ""Folks, here's this really dangerous MAGA Republican congressman threatening to default on the national debt, the debt that took 230 years to accumulate overall… unless we do what they say,"" Biden said during a speech last week. ""They say they're going to default unless I agree to all these wacko notions they have."" ""Default would be worse and totally irresponsible,"" he continued. But McCarthy insisted there was never any threat, and he is actually the one to blame for the delay. ""We're the only ones in Washington that are actually putting a responsible plan out that will raise the debt limit,"" he said. ""Think about it; for more than 80 days it's been since I sat down with the president on February 1st to negotiate, to work through this, and he's ignored it."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sparred with reporters last week when she was asked if the president was responsible for the delay in reaching a bipartisan deal. ""It's not the president that's risking this. It is Congress that is risking this,"" Jean-Pierre responded sharply. ""These political stunts you're seeing from Speaker McCarthy and the MAGA wing – this is dangerous. These are political stunts that will have long-lasting effects."" McCarthy said he is hopeful to have a vote on the budget proposal by the end of this coming week. If it passes, with what he called a ""very slim majority,"" it will head to the Senate for another vote. ""I cannot imagine someone in our conference that would want to go along with Biden's reckless spending. This is responsible. This is something that we have sat down for months that everybody's had input in,"" McCarthy said. ""It's not where everybody gets 100% of what they want, but when we send this to the Senate, we're showing that, yes, we're able to raise the debt ceiling into the next year."" ""What we're doing is we're being responsible fiscally and bringing our house back in order,"" he continued. ""It doesn't solve all of our problems, but it gets us on the right path and this gets us to the negotiating table, just as government and America expects us to do.""

Gen Z voters highlight their picks from 2024's 'star-studded' GOP lineup: We need 'real leadership',"Gen Z guests Isabel Brown, Jahmiel Jackson and Jahmarri Green join ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" to discuss their preferred candidates going into the 2024 election cycle and employer complaints that Gen Z workers are easily offended. Generation Z is stealing the spotlight in the workforce and abroad – months after stealing the GOP's shot at a ""red wave"" in last November's midterms. The notoriously progressive age bracket proves Republicans have a lot of work to do to win over young voters going into 2024 by finding a way to resonate with the generation that's locked into the digital age. But for those among the generation who already opt for Republicans, the star-studded 2024 presidential lineup introduces a bounty of options. To weigh in on their top picks for 2024 and the issues driving their vote, a panel of Gen Z Republicans joined Fox News' Rachel Campos-Duffy on Sunday. GEN Z DEFENDS CANCEL CULTURE AS ‘POSITIVE THING’ ON DR PHIL ‘ZOOMERS VS BOOMERS’ DEBATE Entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy, left, former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are among the preferred candidates for Gen Z Republicans. (Getty Images) ""It's a really exciting time,"" Turning Point USA contributor Isabel Brown said. ""I have so enjoyed following Vivek's [Ramaswamy] campaign as he's shaking things up in the political world and look forward to seeing what might happen in my new home state of Florida."" Jahmiel Jackson, a writer for The Chicago Thinker, said he has his eyes set on either Ramaswamy or Trump, but he argued that GOP leaders' rhetoric emphasizing God and faith – including Ramaswamy's statement that ""God should not be a four-letter word"" and Trump's pledge to reassert Judeo-Christian values if elected – should assume a more policy-based approach. ""I don't think this should be just a general conversation about God. I think there should be actual policies that tie into the current problems in our country. One policy idea I'm really looking forward to someone talking about is: Why don't we tie community service graduation requirements to churches? Make students do some community service in their churches."" GEN Z SAYS THIS EMOJI IS ‘PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE’ – ARE YOU STILL USING IT? Social media is one of the driving influences for Generation Z, according to the age group. One alleged TikTok's influencer trend is creating a more toxic work environment and less motivation for young workers. (Yui Mok / PA Images via Getty Images / File) He said the proposal would help socialize kids and curb skyrocketing crime in the process of bringing younger generations closer to God.COULD AI THREATEN GEN Z'S CAREER PROSPECTS? COLLEGE STUDENTS REVEAL CONCERNS Jahmarri Green, a member of Young Americans for Freedom, said he supports former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, but he is also keeping an eye out for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his bid for the presidency in the near future. ""[I support] Team Haley with everything that they do,"" he said. ""I've been with her since what she's done in South Carolina, what she's done in the U.N. and, hopefully, what she'll do in the future. I'm Camp Haley – all for it right now."" Green said his reason for considering DeSantis involves his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caught criticism from the left for allegedly prolonging exposure to the virus by refusing to follow widespread school or business lockdowns similar to those in other areas of the country. Another issue resonating in the minds of young voters is transgender ideology – particularly gender-affirming care for minors and the pull from left-wing progressives who encourage minors to receive such care under arguably consequential circumstances. ""This has become the forefront conversation of our generation,"" Brown said. ""We're impossibly opening all of our social media apps to find biological men speaking for women and the other way around. Children are being pushed into irreversible chemical and surgical castration before they even go through puberty. Now, 20% of our generation is identifying as LGBTQ+, so it absolutely is an issue that we're seeking real leadership on, not just to protect the innocence of those who come after us but to help dig Gen Z out of this big question that we have really been pushed into by the radical left,"" she continued. Brown, Jackson and Green also weighed in on a recent survey that found managers find Gen Z employees ""difficult"" to work with, particularly because of a sense of ""entitlement"" and their tendency to be ""easily offended."" Jackson said he believes the problem originated with TikTok. ""We are the generation of social influencers. And we have so many social influencers making well over seven-figure salaries doing nothing. They have no skills, no college degree, no mastery, no nothing, and they're getting paid this much money. Most of Gen Z – about 68% – are on TikTok, comparing our lives to them,"" he said. He added that Gen Z's ""reward system"" is ""vastly different"" from that of previous generations.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Taylor Penley is a production assistant with Fox News. ",852,media
WI attorney reacts to trans woman flashing male genitalia at girls in locker room shower: 'Keep our kids safe',"Dan Lennington, Deputy Counsel at the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, discusses a firestorm brought on by a locker room incident at a Wisconsin high school in which a transgender student exposed male genitalia to four female students. Outrage ensued in a Wisconsin school district after an 18-year-old male-to-female transgender student allegedly got into the showers with four freshman girls and exposed their male genitalia to them at an area high school. In a statement, an attorney representing the district admitted the incident should have never happened, but one legal group says the overall response to concerns raised by parents has been lackluster at best. ""The most basic duty of a school district is to keep our kids safe while they learn,"" Dan Lennington, Deputy Counsel at the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), told Fox News' Pete Hegseth on Sunday. TRANS WOMAN SHOWERED WITH FOUR WISCONSIN HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS, VIOLATED THEIR PRIVACY, LETTER TO DISTRICT CLAIMS""These four girls just wanted to rinse off after gym class involving a swim unit and, when they went into the shower, they were confronted by an 18-year-old who undressed, said ‘I’m trans by the way,' and exposed his penis to these four freshman girls."" Sun Prairie High School in Wisconsin. (Fox & Friends Weekend/Screengrab/Google Maps) A letter sent by WILL claimed the trans student ""undressed fully and showered completely naked right next to one of the girls,"" initially with their back turned to the girls, but then faced them, fully exposing male genitals. The incident was reported to student services, but WILL complained that the incident should have been reported to a Title IX coordinator so that the girls could receive the support they needed and be afforded a space to file a complaint. ""Supportive measures might have included accommodations to maintain their access to education and adequate privacy in the locker room, at least while a Title IX investigation was pending. No one from the District contacted any of the girls’ parents at that time, and no one investigated. To be clear, that means that the District’s initial response to this incident violated Title IX,"" the letter continued. WISCONSIN PARENTS OUTRAGED AFTER TEACHHER GIVES TRANSGENDER LESSON TO K-5TH GRADE WITHOUT PERMISSION A transgender flag unfurled on a pole.  (Getty) ""These teachers and administrators did not even investigate this matter the next week and, when the parents finally started to email about this and call about this, the school district couldn't even identify the policy. Nobody could tell the parents – what is the rule? What is the policy?"" Lennington said of the alleged Tilte IX violation, calling the response ""totally inadequate."" Lennington claimed the school district waited a month to sit down with parents to hear their concerns, calling the delay – and the lack of concrete policy on related issues – concerning for schools nationwide. ""This could be going on in schools all across the country,"" he warned. WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT RULES THAT A TRANSGENDER WOMAN CANNOT CHANGE HER NAME BECAUSE SHE IS A SEX OFFENDER Sun Prairie Area School District faced backlash after a transgender student allegedly exposed male genitalia to four freshman girls while showering with them after gym class. (Fox News) Fox News reached out to the superintendent's office for comment and received the following statement from an attorney representing the school district: ""The Sun Prairie Area School District does not condone any student of one sex being present in a state of undress in the presence of students of another sex… The simple truth is that this incident should not have happened, but it did, and the District addressed it long before the recent publicity. School districts across the country are striving to protect and support all students."" ""Districts must balance the dual goals of supporting transitioning students while also protecting the privacy interests of all students."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""They say ‘sex’ and we're not sure what they mean by ‘sex,’"" Lennington responded. ""They don't have a written policy… the question is: Should someone with a penis be in a girls’ locker room or in the shower? And that's the question that they're unable to answer because they won't answer ‘what is a boy? What is a male? What is a female?’"" He elaborated, arguing that girls and young women are the victims of the Biden administration's attempt to ""water down"" Title IX by expanding the measure to include ""gender identity.""

Chicago's Lori Lightfoot slammed over crime pivot following ousting: 'Too little too late',"Retired Chicago police lieutenant John Garrido joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss Lightfoot's pivot on crime and broader concerns surrounding the surge in violence. Chicago's outgoing mayor Lori Lightfoot appeared to make a pivot on her ultra-progressive stance on violence, urging Democrats to ""speak the truth"" on surging crime across the country. But critics say her shift was ""too little, too late,"" as her successor, Mayor-elect Brandon Johnson, is set to be sworn into office next month. Retired Chicago police lieutenant John Garrido accused Lightfoot of refusing to take accountability for the Windy City's surging crime under her leadership during ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" ""Too little, too late,"" Garrido told co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy on Sunday. ""If you listen to her entire speech there, she doesn't take any accountability whatsoever. She still blames everything on Kim Foxx and on Judge Evans.""CHICAGO MAYOR-ELECT JOHNSON TO DOUBLE DOWN ON SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES, DESPITE MIGRANT BUSING FUROR ""I assume she's probably jockeying for some type of position, maybe some point, and maybe Biden gets involved and gives her something. I'm not sure exactly what she's looking for, but she definitely always likes to point the finger at everybody else,"" he continued. ""It's always somebody else's fault. Even when she lost the election, it was somebody else's fault, not her own, but she created the toxic work environment that we have now that's causing thousands of officers to leave every year."" While speaking on a panel at the African American Mayors Association Conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Lightfoot called on Democratic mayors to address the growing crime in their cities. ""As Democrats, if we do not speak the truth about violent crime in our cities, we will be the worse for it,"" Lightfoot said. ""I come to this conversation as a former federal prosecutor. I come to this as a former defense attorney, I am the sister of a returning resident,"" Lightfoot continued. ""But I know that there are people in my city that are wreaking havoc every day and need to be off the streets. That’s reality."" CHICAGO MAYOR-ELECT CONDEMNS ‘TEEN TAKEOVER’ CHAOS, BUT SAYS IT’S ‘NOT CONSTRUCTIVE TO DEMONIZE YOUTH’ Ironically, many critics cite the surge in violence under her leadership as a key reason for her ousting. According to data from the Chicago Police Department, motor vehicle theft has spiked 168%, murders have soared 82%, aggravated battery is up 36%, and theft is up 29% this week in 2023 in comparison to the same week last year. Meanwhile, the process is underway for the city to select a new superintendent for the police department after Lightfoot's pick, David Brown, stepped down back in March. Since Brown's resignation, Interim Superintendent Eric Carter also announced he would be resigning ahead of Johnson's swearing in. While the process will supposedly include more public opinion, Garrido noted the decision is still ultimately up to the mayor. ""This is the first time that we've had this type of commission put together,"" Garrido said. ""It'll be interesting to see how they come together to come up with somebody. They're actually going to have town hall meetings and try to include public opinion."" ""At the end of the day, though, the mayor still gets to make their decision if they want to take those selections or not,"" he continued. ""Back when Rahm Emanuel was in, the police board actually made the recommendations, and he discarded it, made them go back to the drawing board until they picked the one that he wanted.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Johnson narrowly won against his moderate opponent, Democrat Paul Vallas, earlier this month in a runoff election.

Ex-Marine calls for action after GOP rep grills VA official on 'faith-based' PTSD partnerships,"'Save Our Allies' co-founder and U.S. Marine veteran Chad Robichaux reacts to NSC Coordinator John Kirby's play down of the 'chaos' in the Afghanistan withdrawal and the Biden administration blaming Donald Trump. A retired Recon Marine with eight Afghanistan deployments who also battled PTSD called for the Biden administration to actively partner with faith-based veterans' mental health programs and organizations, after a Veterans Affairs official was pressed on the issue during a hearing. Chad Robichaux, founder of the Mighty Oaks Foundation – which provides faith-based programs to combat psychological and emotional challenges of veterans returning home –  told Fox News Digital he was outraged by the answers he heard in the House VA Subcommittee on Health hearing this week. During the hearing, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis. – a retired Navy SEAL himself -- invoked Robichaux's foundation while questioning Dr. Tamara Campbell, executive director of the Veterans Health Administration's Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. Van Orden asked Campbell whether her office is ""preventing veterans from committing suicide or not."" WHITE HOUSE, KIRBY FACE BACKLASH FROM MILITARY VETERANS OVER DEFENSE OF AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL REPORT Chad Robichaux appears on ""Fox News @ Night"" (Fox News) ""Or are we just spending money and hiring people so that they can get together, come to these committee meetings, talk a bunch, submit reports, with metrics that can't be defined?"" he asked. Campbell said her department is ""moving the needle on this"" and must have a ""full public health approach where suicide prevention is concerned."" Van Orden further asked how many ""faith-based non-evidence programs"" the VA is currently administering to veterans seeking their help and what her office's ""metrics for success"" are. ""Within VA, we certainly value scientifically-based-evidence-based programs. That does not mean, however, that we don't collaborate with our chaplain services…"" Campbell replied. Van Orden said Campbell's response suggested the department is not actively working with ""wildly successful"" programs ""because they are faith-based – which according to you guys are 'non-evidence-based'."" ""Living veterans: That's evidence of a program's functioning,"" Van Orden said, going on to reference Robichaux's organization. Campbell added the department would, however, be willing to meet with Mighty Oaks to discuss a potential partnership. In response, Robichaux told Fox News he was thankful for Van Orden's questioning, saying he hopes the VA will keep its word and reach out to his group.

(Scott Varley/MediaNews Group/Torrance Daily Breeze via Getty) Robichaux, who also co-founded the Save Our Allies organization that was instrumental in rescuing Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall from Ukraine, claimed the VA ""cherry-picked data"" in its report and wrongly excluded overdoses, at least at the present time. ""The American taxpayer is funding a one-solution system for the mental health and suicide epidemic for our warriors, and it is a pharmaceutical one. And it is failing,"" Robichaux said. He criticized U.S. aid to Afghanistan that he suggested is simply landing in the hands of the Taliban. ""Meanwhile we are giving … $113 billion to corruption in Ukraine, [without] congressional oversight. With just one of those billion [dollars], faith-based VSOs could nearly eradicate this crisis amongst our military community,"" Robichaux argued. Robichaux told Fox News the Obama administration previously removed funding for faith-and community-based programs through a 2009 executive order, while adding he formally asked then-candidate Donald Trump in 2015 to overturn the order. ""The truth is PTSD, and trauma are typically spiritual wounds to the human soul, and a spiritual wound requires a spiritual solution found through a relationship with God,"" he said. ""We cannot take this away from our warriors and expect them to heal…"" REPUBLICAN DERRICK VAN ORDEN FLIPS WISCONSIN HOUSE SEAT RED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty) Trump reportedly agreed to Robichaux's request, and weeks before his administration ended, the VA proposed a rule removing regulatory barriers ushering in ""equal treatment"" between religious and non-religious organizations in VA-supported social service programs. Robichaux told Fox News he will continue to work with organizations inside and outside of government that are ""willing do our part to end this horrific epidemic among our nations heroes."" Robichaux argued Mighty Oaks' has thousands of success stories and ""third-party independent data"" showed it to be an ""evidence-based"" program despite the use of the moniker during Campbell's hearing. In response to the hearing's testimony, Van Orden told Fox News as a retired SEAL who has lost friends to suicide, he feels the VA must take an ""all of the above approach to help prevent this scourge."" ""I am sick and tired of this bureaucracy refusing to acknowledge that what they call ‘non-evidence based’ treatment programs have actually shown solid evidence of saving the lives of my fellow veterans, particularly faith-based programs,"" he said. Van Orden added the VA's Office of Mental Health & Suicide Prevention has been in existence for three decades, positing he would have ""no idea, if they closed tomorrow, if a single veteran’s life would be saved."" In response to some of the criticism, the VA said in a lengthy statement to Fox News Digital that the department stops ""at nothing to get Veterans who live with substance use disorder the help they need and deserve."" ""VA offers a comprehensive continuum of specialty substance use disorder (SUD) services for Veterans, not just medication-based treatment. This continuum of care includes specialty SUD treatment outpatient and residential programs."" In response to the concern regarding whether overdose-suicide deaths were included in the report at hand, the department said its National Suicide Prevention Annual Report includes overdoses deemed to be suicides. ""The purpose of the report is to count every veteran suicide so we can prevent every veteran suicide. Ending veteran suicide and saving lives is our top clinical priority at VA, and we take every step possible to make sure that our veteran suicide data is accurate—because the first step to solving this problem is understanding it,"" the department said. ""In the interest of full transparency, we release yearly reports detailing how we come to the conclusions in the Annual Suicide Prevention Report."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In response to criticism of the perception it weighs pharmaceutical-based resources over others, the VA also said its work has positioned it to ""respond to emerging drug use trends"" and that the substance abuse epidemic is a paramount concern for its patents and veterans writ-large. Outside of pharmacological assistance, the VA told Fox News it recently hired ""peer specialists"" to work with veterans suffering from addiction with the goal of increasing engagement and retention of an array of treatment options. The department's latest budget allocated for expanded residential program access, additional homeless veteran case managers and expanded access to employment support for veterans-in-treatment or recovery, the VA told Fox News Digital. Regarding the state of the 2020 faith-based organizations ""equal treatment"" rule proposed under the Trump administration, the VA pointed Fox News Digital to a January 2023 proposal by the Biden-Harris VA ""restoring protections for beneficiaries of federally funded social services."" According to the release, nine agencies, including Veterans Affairs, are party to a proposal to ""further advance President Biden's call for religious freedom and equity,"" which included a stipulation to ""continue to notify such [faith-based providers of federally-funded social services] they are equally eligible to compete with other organizations"" for grants.

And it was just nuts, you know, and we're way past that already. And Corona was a major setback, I think, in a lot of people's minds as well, like the way that we were living. We just had a breakdown and that was a way to break it. So I always thank Governor DeSantis for that moment."" Gov. Ron DeSantis  (James Gilbert/Getty Images) Coming from a family of immigrants, Masvidal said he ""learned many lessons"" by escaping communism and coming to America.

Donald Trump dishes on past friendship with Bill Clinton,"Former President Donald Trump sits down with Mark Levin for a wide-ranging interview on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' Former President Donald Trump might currently be the Clintons' most high-profile political foil, but that wasn't always the case, he told Fox News. Trump told ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" he used to have a cordial relationship with the 42nd president and his wife, so much so as to frequently exchange letters with Clinton. ""They came to my wedding,"" Trump quipped, as Bill and Hillary were guests of his 2005 wedding to the former Melania Knauss. Other guests included left-wing pundit Chris Matthews and a slew of famous New Yorkers including Billy Joel, Tony Bennett, former Republican Gov. George Pataki and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Bill Clinton used to play regularly at Trump National Golf Club Westchester, he added.

He loves playing golf, and he was... better [at golf] than people think… He's got a certain athleticism, actually."" Trump recalled playing rounds of golf with Bill Clinton, and later retiring to the clubhouse where the 42nd president would spend as many as two-and-a-half hours waxing about politics. ""This is before I even thought in terms of politics for myself,"" he said. In that regard, Trump said Bill Clinton's retail politician persona and political acumen presented a major missed opportunity for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential loss post-mortem. ""I think they did a great disservice by not using him when I went against Hillary. I think that they had this unbelievable weapon known as Bill Clinton, who was a natural politician,"" he said. BILL CLINTON'S EX-POLLSTER BLASTS TRUMP INDICTMENT AS POLITICIZATION OF JUSTICE Hillary Clinton (Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty) Trump recounted how Hillary Clinton declined to visit Wisconsin during the 2016 race, purportedly considering it in-the-bag for her column — and not visiting Michigan one final time before election day. He claimed Bill Clinton had made reference to being in Michigan and seeing a prevalence of Trump-Pence signage ""all over the place,"" adding he purportedly warned his wife's campaign they needed to take notice there and in the Badger State for similar reasons.

Joy Reid compares Supreme Court’s Samuel Alito to extremist ‘mullahs’ for abortion drug ruling dissent,"MSNBC host Joy Reid smeared U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday night for his dissent in the Court’s decision to allow the FDA to keep abortion drug mifepristone accessible to Americans. MSNBC host Joy Reid slammed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday night for his dissent in the court’s decision to allow the FDA to keep abortion drug mifepristone accessible to Americans. During the Friday episode of her MSNBC show, ""The ReidOut,"" Reid claimed that Alito was playing ""mullah"" in his dissent on Friday, likening him to an Islamic religious zealot. The attack is unsurprising for Reid who often refers to pro-life political figures as religious extremists oppressing women’s rights to abortion. JOY REID DRAWS COMPARISON BETWEEN REPUBLICAN VOTERS AND AL QAEDA AFTER CALLING PARTY 'PRO-RAPE' MSNBC host Joy Reid claimed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alitos dissent in SCOTUS abortion bill case is him playing ""mullah."" (Screenshot/MSNBC) Fox News Digital reported that ""After delaying its decision earlier this week, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that full access to the abortion pill mifepristone can continue as a lawsuit works its way through the lower federal courts."" The move was seen as a victory of the Biden administration and the pro-choice side who have been fighting to make the pill more available, especially since the end of Roe v. Wade with the Court’s decision in Dobbs last year. Two justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented in the decision, though Reid chose to pick apart the former’s dissent during her broadcast Friday. While discussing the ruling MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin and another panelist, Reid read an excerpt from Alito’s opinion and trashed it.

Addressing Rubin, she provided her interpretation of that excerpt. She said, ""Lisa, this reads to me like him admitting, ‘We don’t have an army, we don’t have the ability to enforce our decisions, and we’re not sure the government would even obey.’"" She chuckled, adding, ""That’s a pretty glaring admission of weakness and a pretty churlish thing to write down in your dissent.

NY Times reveals Biden has held fewest press conferences since Reagan: ‘Strategy to protect from criticism,"House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., says the federal government has known ‘for a long time’ that Hunter Biden was very involved in ‘shady’ business meetings with ‘adversaries’ around the world. As reported by New York Times White House correspondent Michael Shear, President Joe Biden has held the ""fewest"" press conferences since Ronald Reagan was in office. In a piece for the outlet, Shear called out the Biden administration for being one of the least accessible presidents to the press in 100 years, despite his administration pledging he would have one the most transparent presidencies. The reporter surmised that Biden’s few interactions with the media is evidence that ""his political strategists want to protect him from the unscripted exchanges that have often resulted in missteps and criticism.""

President Biden is spending the weekend in Wilmington, Delaware.  ((Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)) Shear’s piece began with the numbers on just how rare it is for Biden to offer unscripted answers to the press, stating, ""In the 100 years since Calvin Coolidge took office, only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan held as few news conferences each year as the current occupant of the Oval Office."" The report touched on how, during Biden’s recent trip to Ireland, he ""abandoned the decades-old tradition of holding a news conference while abroad."" And when he met with Colombian President Gustavo Petro this week, ""the two did not hold a news conference together, another practice of his predecessors that Mr. Biden has frequently chosen to skip,"" Shear observed. The report noted the hypocrisy of Biden’s actions, considering his staff’s campaign promises. Shear wrote, ""And despite his press secretary pledging that Mr. Biden would ‘bring transparency and truth back to the government,’ in his first two years, the president granted the fewest interviews since Mr. Reagan’s presidency: only 54."" In that same span of time during their respective presidencies, ""Donald J. Trump gave 202,"" while ""Barack Obama gave 275,"" Shear wrote. He added, ""More than any president in recent memory, Mr. Biden, 80, has taken steps to reduce opportunities for journalists to question him in forums where he can offer unscripted answers and they can follow up. The result, critics say, is a president who has fewer moments of public accountability for his comments, decisions and actions.""

(JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) The Times piece surmised that Biden’s decision to withhold from the press is deliberate strategy to spare him criticism and embarrassment for his many gaffes and awkward public moments. It said, ""The president’s strategy of keeping the press at arm’s length is a bet that he can sidestep those traditions in a new media environment. And it is public evidence that Mr. Biden’s political strategists want to protect him from the unscripted exchanges that have often resulted in missteps and criticism."" Of course, the Biden team claims this strategy is about reaching ""the American people wherever and however they consume media, and that’s not just through the briefing room or Washington-based news outlets,"" White House comms director Ben LaBolt said. He added, ""the fracturing of the media and the changing nature of information consumption requires a communications strategy that adapts to reach Americans where they get the news."" LaBolt maintained that Biden has ""held nearly 400 question-and-answer sessions with reporters since he took office,"" noting that is more than Trump, Obama, or former President George W. Bush did. However, Shear clarified in his write-up, ""But those interactions between Mr. Biden and reporters are usually very brief, with shouted questions that the president often chooses not to answer. When he does, it is sometimes with a clipped, one- or two-word response.""

'Human irresponsibility:' PETA sounds the alarm on why humans are contributing to NYC's rat problem,"PETA Director of Outreach Ashley Byrne joined ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ to discuss New York City’s rat problem, why humans are to blame and how to get it under control. New York City finally found its ""rat czar"" to take on the rodents in the Big Apple, but one critic says the problem likely won’t be fixed until humans change their behavior. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Director of Outreach Ashley Byrne said rats aren’t the problem. ""The disgusting human behavior that is attracting the rats -that's the problem. We are basically inviting them to be here by putting out a daily buffet of garbage around the city,"" she explained Thursday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

""The city can kill as many rats as it wants to. They're just going to keep coming back. You know, this is nothing more than a quick fix,"" she said.

College students open up about artificial intelligence in the classroom: 'Everyone is using ChatGPT',"College students Tabatha Fajardo, Jay Ram and Kyra Varnavas give their take on the development of AI in the classroom on 'The Story.' College students impacted by the increased presence of artifical intelligence on their campuses gave ""The Story"" their take on how the technology will affect them in the classroom and the job market. AI has the ability to mimic human consciousness and complete tasks like writing essays, driving a family across the country or making decisions in a chess game, according to a previous Fox News Digital report. ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, is gaining popularity among young people who can type in a writing prompt and receive an essay back in minutes. ""If you go into a library right now, you can see sort of everyone is using ChatGPT,"" college junior Jay Ram told host Martha MacCallum on Thursday. ""I think there are people who are using it for bad that are using it to write the essay for them, and there are people who are using it sort of like Google as, like, a research tool."" While complex AI programming can aid students in showing them steps to complete a math problem or giving them ideas for their research projects, some Americans have voiced concerns about the impact programming has on learning. WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF AI? Campus Reform correspondent Tabatha Fajardo, who attends Stony Brook University, explained that while many Americans fear AI will be used to replace humans, the man-made programming cannot take away from authentic human connection. ""You can insert something into a program and they'll create a haiku for you, but it will never take away from the human connection,"" she said. Fajardo also noted a report finding that many students view AI technology's use as a form of cheating. ""A recent report by Leadership Institute's Campus Reform reported on a survey about intelligence that states that about a third of its college-age students who had responded said that they had admitted to using ChatGPT and AI like it and so, not only have they used it, but there's a large majority of students who say that it's also considered a form of cheating,"" Fajardo said. ""In order to prepare to enter the job market, we need to be doing the work honestly and so it brings up the question about academic integrity."" Many college students wonder what impact the new programming will have on the job market. ""In the financial industry, there are so many different applications of AI that can be seen within finance and especially, for example, for roles that may be more trading-intensive as far as trading securities,"" said Kyra Varnavas, a finance major at Fordham University. ""There are already a lot of algorithms that are beginning to be more prominent in the industry, and that's something that I definitely keep in mind when I'm on the job search.""

Missouri school district putting 'they/them' pronouns in math class to help kids' 'mathematical identities'," A Missouri school district is now making its math curriculum more gender inclusive, updating word problems and other language-based math equations with ""they/them"" pronouns. As presented in a Webster Groves School District ""math program evaluation"" last week, non-binary people will be represented in ""word and contextual"" problems via the pronouns, alongside regular gendered people using he/she pronouns. Local outlet KCRG-TV reported that during the presentation, Webster Groves Math Curriculum Coordinator Susan Bergman claimed that the inclusion of the non-binary pronouns will ""help students develop their ‘mathematical identities,"" and move them to ""see the beauty, joy, and connectedness of mathematics as a way to see, make sense of and change our world.""

In addition to the poll showing support for more inclusive language in math, student ""empathy"" interviews were included in the consideration for the update. The Webster Groves math evaluation presentation argued that it is a ""persistent myth within math education that since ‘numbers are universal,’ math classrooms are objective and free of bias."" It added that ""Research shows clearly that any space where learning occurs is neither free of bias nor resistant to oppressive systems such as racism, sexism, classism or xenophobia.""

Kennedy Jr. weighed in, arguing that there are ""things that [he's] much more frightened of."" ""I'm clearly aware of that risk, but there are things that I'm much more frightened of than, you know, than death, for example. I'm much more frightened of losing my constitutional rights and of America losing its democracy,"" Kennedy Jr. continued. ""I don't think age is the major metric. I think the metric is your physical health and your mental acuity. So, I mean, there are people who are 80 years old, who I meet who seem almost younger than me. So I don't think the actual chronological age is the limiting factor. I think the more important issue is, is just the mental acuity,"" he said.

NY Post scorches ‘fake’ intel letter used to sink laptop story: ‘Actual disinfo operation’ helped Biden,"Rep. James Comer: Hunter Biden whistleblowers are starting to cooperate. The New York Post editorial board reacted forcefully to the news that then-Biden campaign staff allegedly helped cook up the 2020 letter signed by 51 intelligence ""experts"" which denounced the paper’s Hunter Biden laptop story as a Russian hoax. The editorial provided a searing condemnation of the entire operation to stymie the paper’s reporting and save the 2020 election for Biden, involving the intel community, the Biden campaign, news outlets, and social media platforms. Testimony from former acting CIA Director Mike Morell this week alleged that then-Biden campaign advisor Antony Blinken ""played a role in the inception"" of the public statement signed by former and current U.S. intelligence experts claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation.

After the letter was crafted, the media and Biden team trotted it out to discredit reporting on the Biden family’s corruption found on the computer, reporting that was led by The New York Post’s bombshell story revealing the existence of the laptop and its contents. The Post took a rhetorical sledgehammer to the Biden-aided plot to discredit their bombshell story, opening its editorial with the statement, ""The dishonor of our intelligence community, and most of the media, is now complete."" It added, ""It turns out the ‘51 intel experts’ letter implying Hunter Biden’s 100% authentic laptop was a Russian fake, and the ensuing efforts to kill Post reporting on it, were the actual disinfo operation."" The Post first targeted Morell, calling him a ""Veteran spook"" and painting him as the person who ""masterminded"" the disinfo operation. It then mentioned his obvious political bias in doing so, writing ""And Morell plainly also did it in hopes a victorious Biden would hand him the top CIA job."" The outlet, whose piece on the laptop was also censored on Twitter and other social media platforms based on the word of these intel experts, declared, ""Not only was there no intricate Russian plot, there was never any evidence suggesting one — only a Biden campaign conspiracy to bury the truth under a tissue of lies.""

CDC linked to pervasive curriculum sweeping public schools nationwide,"Dukes and Jackson, both with No Left Turn in Education, said parents should be concerned about how AI is being used in schools, and what information it may gather on students. Educators at over 120 districts across the country are implementing a pervasive school curriculum that has been denounced by opponents as an effort to manipulate children's values and beliefs and replace parents as the primary moral authority in their child's lives, with many critics specifically pointing to similarities with programs from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a major point of contention. The School Superintendent's Association (AASA), with the help of superintendents, board members and school administrators, is implementing the Learning 2025 program, which calls for an equity-focused, ""holistic redesign"" of the United States' public education system by 2025, in districts across the country The parents' advocacy group, No Left Turn in Education (NLTE), is sounding the alarm about the curriculum's alleged ties to the CDC, especially since Learning 2025 outlines its plans as a solution to the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning 2025 frequently references the idea of a ""Whole Child"" educational framework to promote the notion that school districts should focus on a collective, whole community vision that is strikingly similar to the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) educational framework devised by the CDC. Both programs place a strong emphasis on students’ and teachers’ social and emotional health, including employee wellness programs, as well as psychological and social services like school-based health and counseling centers. PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICT CONSIDERS BRINGING ‘FEELINGS' INTO MATH CURRICULUM AS SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS BALK NLTE Chief Operating Officer Melissa Jackson said Learning 2025 is just a new way to make money on the same CDC product because ""the components are still the same"" with the emphasis on utilizing the community to influence and curate the ""Whole Child"" and their personal ideals beyond reading, writing and arithmetic. Mixed race kids at home using smart tablets to play games. (iStock) The CDC's ""Whole Child"" approach places its focus on psychological counseling and social services for students and teachers to further the ""collaboration between education leaders and health sectors to improve each child’s cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development,"" which is often referred to as social emotional learning (SEL). SEL is advertised as a way to teach students social skills in support of their mental health and emotional wellbeing, but it has been criticized as a way to implement controversial topics like Critical Race Theory and Gender Theory. As a result, it has become a point of contention among parents, teachers and politicians who advocate for a strong academic emphasis at school and against classroom discussions that they feel should be left up to parents' discretion at home. NLTE refers to SEL as ""socially engineered learning"" because instead of placing the emphasis on reading, writing and arithmetic, they argue it moves the focus away from academics to center on higher cognitive skills, like self-awareness, empathy and control of emotions. EXCLUSIVE: LIBERAL FOUNDATIONS FUNNEL MILLIONS TO RED STATES FOR WOKE SCHOOL PROGRAMS; PARENTS DEMAND CHANGE When reached for comment, the CDC told Fox News Digital that Learning 2025 ""is not a CDC program,"" but a document about the program indicates a connection between the CDC and AASA. ""AASA is using the new model with our superintendent cadre,"" a document about the CDC's Whole Child program states. ""We’ve updated all of our coordinated school health training materials to include the new model as the model for coordinated school health"" and ""We’ve created a booster session and updated training materials to reflect the WSCC [CDC] model."" The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been criticized and mocked from all sides after a series of muddled messages have baffled Americans amid a record surge in COVID-19 cases and the spread of the omicron variant.

""Learning 2025 is [billed as] the answer to what has happened to the children,"" but ""the root of the problem is not the COVID shutdown … goes back to the attack on culture,"" Dukes said. ""I have a problem accepting a program from the very same people that caused the problem,"" she added. ""That's what I want parents to know, is that these organizations were part of it, and now they're offering you a solution to the problem."" BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR ‘WOKE’ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CALLED ‘SOCIAL CANCER’ Holly Terei serves as NLTE's National Director of Teacher Coalition and attended a Learning 2025 conference last summer, where she observed the curriculum's framework in action. She said she also noticed the similarities between Learning 2025 and the CDC model. ""If you put Learning 2025 and the CDC Whole Child model side by side, it is exactly the same,"" Terei said. ""They tweak some of the wording like whole learner and whole child."" ""It's kind of like, let's put lipstick on a pig and call it a lady,"" she added.

They make recommendations, but because the CDC is heavily influenced by donors, she described their work as a complete overreach of power and a problematic partnership of public and private entities influencing policy in an effort to exclude parents from the conversation. At the Learning 2025 conference last summer, Terei said she felt there was a common notion that educators, not parents, know what is best for their children. She said strategies were promoted to teach superintendents how to ""shush us and push us [parents] out of the picture, so they can do what they feel is best for our children.""

""Instead of your child being looked at as an extension of you or belonging to you, they are looked at as an extension of the government and of the government schools,"" Terei said. ""This is a total overreach through these public and private partnerships, and it is incredibly concerning,"" she added. ""We're opening a Pandora's box, I believe, through these initiatives.""

""Through what I've learned at the conference, there's an intentionality of bypassing parental rights by not being transparent about the implementation of the program, the data collection that goes into it, the fact that it's not a proven educational program and that our children, who have been signed up as demo districts with Learning 2025, are literally a part of a social educational experiment,"" Terei said.

Florida landlord sounds the alarm over state's squatter problem: 'Property rights in this state are absurd',"Florida landlord Patti Peeples shares how squatters in Jacksonville wreaked havoc on her property and caused $40,000 in damages on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' A Florida landlord is speaking out and raising awareness about a squatter problem in the state after several squatters moved into her Jacksonville property and caused nearly $40,000 in damages. Patti Peeples shot a video inside the property showing holes in the walls, doors ripped off hinges and feces on the carpet. She confronted the squatters, telling them she owned the property. ""It doesn't f****** matter,"" the squatter replied. P⁠⁠eeples explained that the squatters broke into the property by drilling out the deadbolt and replacing it with their own.

The embarrassing thing Hunter Biden whistleblower reveals about the media,"House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., says the federal government has known ‘for a long time’ that Hunter Biden was very involved in ‘shady’ business meetings with ‘adversaries’ around the world. The story the legacy media tried for years to suppress is back with a vengeance. Hunter Biden, the president’s oft-troubled son, is once more in the news and not in a good way. An IRS criminal supervisory agent requested whistleblower protection, claiming that the five-year Hunter Biden investigation is being impacted by ""preferential treatment and politics."" To make things worse for the press, the White House responded to the allegations just days before President Joe Biden is reportedly announcing his re-election campaign. White House spokesman Ian Sams told Fox News Digital that the president has stood by his commitment to Department of Justice ""independence"" and said that the investigation is ""free from any political interference."" This is a perfect storm for the press, which has done everything it can for years to protect Hunter Biden from embarrassing coverage that might hurt his father. Now journalists are stuck at least acknowledging the crisis. That doesn’t mean they will cover it fairly. Still, news eked out in the coverage, such as the fact that I.R.S. and F.B.I. agents reportedly want to bring charges against Hunter Biden, or that the whistleblower claims to have information that would ""contradict sworn testimony by a senior political appointee."" CBS said, ""that was Attorney General Merrick Garland."" Maybe that explains why the investigation has lasted longer than a presidential term. News types might ask that question, but only if Biden had an ""R"" after his name. BIDEN CAMPAIGN, BLINKEN ORCHESTRATED INTEL LETTER TO DISCREDIT HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY, EX-CIA OFFICIAL SAYS CBS led the way for the broadcast networks with a story April 19, as the news broke. Both ABC and NBC followed the next morning with their own takes. Thursday morning, NBC spent only 36 seconds on the story. That’s like covering a forest fire with a glass of water, but they still did it. ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" devoted more than three times that with fill-in co-host Rebecca Jarvis declaring, ""ABC News learning the president’s son is allegedly getting preferential treatment."" That’s quite the step-up for a show that is ordinarily a Democrat mouthpiece run by anchor and former official Democrat mouthpiece George Stephanopoulos. The Washington Post ran with a straight investigation story on Wednesday under the headline, ""Whistleblower claims administration is mishandling probe of Biden’s son."" Notably absent from the headline was mention of Hunter Biden. By Thursday, the Post tried another tactic, mentioning Hunter in a PR piece about him assuming a larger role in the president’s campaign. The paper’s whole argument was that Hunter Biden aiding his father’s campaign is a good thing – despite all of his scandals. As the Post put it, Hunter, ""after years of listening to his father’s advisers counseling a low profile, is now willing to take a more public posture."" ""Hunter Biden takes on higher profile amid investigations"" waited 12 paragraphs to note the new allegations. The article quoted the president and his son a combination of 15 times, along with a couple Biden supporters. It cited the whistleblower’s lawyer just once and Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer twice. This was the paper glossing over a son who makes the stories about Jimmy Carter’s brother Billy laughable by comparison. (At least, Billy Carter preferred to drink his refreshments and brought us the classic ""Billy Beer."") Instead, Hunter is portrayed as the dutiful son keeping his senile father in line, literally. That results in this exchange: ""‘You’re supposed to do the rope line, Dad,’ the son said.  ‘I’m supposed to do the rope line?’ the father responded. ‘Just to say hi to everybody,’ the son offered."" A more accurate portrayal of the incident might note that the leader of the free world is being led around by his unelected, formerly drug-addled son. Hardly comforting. The New York Times downplayed the news and ran with, ""I.R.S. Official Is Said to Assert Political Meddling in Hunter Biden Inquiry."" Fifteen paragraphs into the Times piece, the paper admitted, ""I.R.S. and F.B.I. agents have complained for months that they have enough evidence to bring a case against Hunter Biden."" The paper added that the question is ""whether a less prominent person would be charged with a crime in the same circumstances."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Both papers lacked the typical venom they use in stories attacking Republican politicians, but they still had to write them. Shocker, I know. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Now, the question is how the press will handle this embarrassing situation going forward. Will they try to bury the story six-feet under, like they did with Hunter’s laptop prior to the election? Or will they allow more coverage, reflecting Democrat Party sentiment that Biden needs to be pushed aside and that Hunter could be just the man to do it? Either way, you can bet that most reporting won’t have anything to do with journalism. Instead, it will be either a way to protect Biden’s re-election or push him aside so another, more-electable Democrat can take over.

SCOTUS Christian postal worker case will change standard on accommodating religious Americans: Legal counsel,"Randall Wenger, chief counsel for the Independence Law Center representing a Christian postal worker who was denied Sundays off to observe the Sabbath, explains the case on 'The Story.' Legal counsel representing a Christian postal worker who was reportedly disciplined for refusing to work on Sundays says it is clear the Supreme Court is ""going to change the standard"" to accommodate religious Americans in the workplace. Gerald Groff, an evangelical Christian mail carrier from Pennsylvania, resigned believing he would be fired from the U.S. Postal Service after he said he could not deliver Amazon packages on Sundays because he observes the Sabbath. Groff’s attorney Aaron Streett is arguing the Supreme Court should overturn precedent that employers can deny religious accommodations to employees if they impose ""more than a de minimis cost"" on the business, according to a previous Fox News report. ""We understand that we need to give accommodations to employees in all kinds of different areas,"" Randall Wenger, chief counsel for the Independence Law Center, told ""America Reports"" on Tuesday. ""Think of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We were supposed to reasonably accommodate unless it is an undue hardship and the same thing under religion."" ""We're supposed to reasonably accommodate unless there's an undue hardship, but the standard that we use, what we call undue hardship under the ADA, is very different than what we call undue hardship under religion and why would we give less protection for religion than we do for the ADA? We need to give robust protections to religious Americans.""

""The post office has got lots of employees,"" the legal counsel explained. ""They could have other employees that don't have that religious problem with being able to deliver the packages, but to force him to do it, would be to force him to violate his conscience."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Wenger said Groff ""loved"" his job and had ""many great years"" working at the post office. ""He was a hard worker,"" Wenger told Fox News. ""He would fill in other people's shifts. He would work holidays. He would sometimes work more than one shift a day to get the mail delivered. The post office isn't better off having this really good employer out of here. We're all better off when we can figure out how to make it work for everyone.""

The Wall Street Journal editorial board argued President Joe Biden is too old to run for re-election Friday, amid reports he is likely to announce his 2024 bid next week. ""The public understands what Mr. Biden apparently won’t admit: that electing an octogenarian in obvious decline for another four years could be an historic mistake,"" the editors wrote. The editors continued, ""asking the country to elect a man who is 80 years old and whose second term would end when he is 86 is a risky act that borders on selfish.""

Musician Hunter Hayes on the cost of fame and anxiety: 'I'm my hardest critic',"FOX Sports NFL analyst Jay Glazer shares how individuals can tackle mental health by leaning into each other on 'One Nation with Brian Kilmeade.' Singer-songwriter Hunter Hayes rose to massive fame when he first entered the music scene, but reflecting in a new interview with Fox News Digital, he said he'd have some advice for his younger self. Hayes shot to stardom in the years 2011 and 2012 with the help of catchy songs like, ""Storm Warning"" and the ballad ""Wanted,"" the latter of which was a staple on both country and pop stations. While he seemed to be one of the hottest tickets in the music industry at the time, years later Hayes has opened up about how fame took a toll on his mental health.

""And ‘Victory’ specifically… I just wanted a song that talked about process,"" he said. ""I mean, how many times have we heard from… whether it be therapists or speakers about how it's always in process. And I had to do a lot of personal growth in order to achieve the music that I wanted for this album. So... I just kept taking that away from conversations. There is no end point. There's just who I am, who you are now and what you do with today. And what you do with now. And to celebrate. I'm my hardest critic, and that can be really challenging for me."" He pulled out a line from the track that hit especially close to home. ""There's a line in the second verse, 'Two steps forward, one step back, and I'm OK with that'… I wanted a place to celebrate... for people to celebrate themselves and to feel celebrated and to feel accomplished and give themselves credit for what they have done, you know, not focus on - which I'm guilty of - focusing on where you want to be versus where you are, but rather focusing on where you are and being grateful for where you are,"" Hayes explained. ‘MONDAY BLUES’: HOW TO COMBAT ANXIETY AND SADNESS AS A NEW WEEK BEGINS, ACCORDING TO EXPERT Country star Hunter Hayes is a multi-instrumentalist.

Misinformation machines? Tech titans grappling with how to stop chatbot 'hallucinations',"Eugenia Kuyda defended AI companion bots during the interview with Fox News Digital and argued that dating app Replika is just one of many possible solutions to loneliness. Tech giants are ill-prepared to combat ""hallucinations"" generated by artificial intelligence platforms, industry experts warned in comments to Fox News Digital, but corporations themselves say they're taking steps to ensure accuracy within the platforms. AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Google's Bard, can at times spew inaccurate misinformation or nonsensical text, referred to as ""hallucinations."" ""The short answer is no, corporation and institutions are not ready for the changes coming or challenges ahead,"" said AI expert Stephen Wu, chair of the American Bar Association Artificial Intelligence and Robotics National Institute, and a shareholder with Silicon Valley Law Group. MISINFORMATION MACHINES? COMMON SENSE THE BEST GUARD AGAINST AI CHATBOT ‘HALLUCINATIONS,’ EXPERTS SAY Often, hallucinations are honest mistakes made by technology that, despite promises, still possess flaws. Companies should have been upfront with consumers about these flaws, one expert said. ""I think what the companies can do, and should have done from the outset … is to make clear to people that this is a problem,"" Irina Raicu, director of the Internet Ethics Program at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California, told Fox News Digital. Consumers need to be wary of misinformation from AI chatbots, just as they would be with any other information source. (Getty images) ""This shouldn’t have been something that users have to figure out on their own. They should be doing much more to educate the public about the implications of this."" Large language models, such as the one behind ChatGPT, take billions of dollars and years to train, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC last week. In building Amazon's own foundation model Titan, the company was ""really concerned"" with accuracy and producing high-quality responses, Bratin Saha, an AWS vice president, told CNBC in an interview. Platforms have spit out erroneous answers to what seem to be simple questions of fact. Other major generative AI platforms such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Bard, meanwhile, have been found to be spitting out erroneous answers to what seem to be simple questions of fact. In one published example from Google Bard, the program claimed incorrectly that the James Webb Space Telescope ""took the very first pictures of a planet outside the solar system."" It did not. Google has taken steps to ensure accuracy in its platforms, such as adding an easy way for users to ""Google it"" after inserting a query into the Bard chatbot. Despite steps taken by the tech giants to stop misinformation, experts were concerned about the ability to completely prevent it.  (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration) Microsoft's Bing Chat, which is based on the same large language model as ChatGPT, also links to sources where users can find more information about their queries, as well as allowing users to ""like"" or ""dislike"" answers given by the bot. ""We have developed a safety system including content filtering, operational monitoring and abuse detection to provide a safe search experience for our users,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""Corporation and institutions are not ready for the changes coming or challenges ahead."" — AI expert Stephen Wu ""We have also taken additional measures in the chat experience by providing the system with text from the top search results and instructions to ground its responses in search results. Users are also provided with explicit notice that they are interacting with an AI system and advised to check the links to materials to learn more."" In another example, ChatGPT reported that late Sen. Al Gore Sr. was ""a vocal supporter of Civil Rights legislation."" In actuality, the senator vocally opposed and voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. MISINFORMATION MACHINES? AI CHATBOT ‘HALLUCINATIONS’ COULD POSE POLITICAL, INTELLECTUAL, INSTITUTIONAL DANGERS Despite steps taken by the tech giants to stop misinformation, experts were concerned about the ability to completely prevent it. ""I don’t know that it is [possible to be fixed]"" Christopher Alexander, chief communications officer of Liberty Blockchain, based in Utah, told Fox News Digital. ""At the end of the day, machine or not, it’s built by humans, and it will contain human frailty … It is not infallible, it is not omnipotent, it is not perfect.""

In this photo illustration, an Amazon AWS logo is seen displayed on a smartphone. (Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) ""It's not perfect but this does help to enhance A.I. performance and reduce hallucinations."" These hallucinations could cause legal trouble for tech companies in the future, Alexander warned. ""The only way are really going to look at this seriously is they are going to get sued for so much money it hurts enough to care,"" he said. ""The only way they are really going to look at this seriously is they are going to get sued for so much money it hurts enough to care."" — Christopher Alexander The ethical responsibility of tech companies when it comes to chatbot hallucinations is a ""morally gray area,"" Ari Lightman, a professor at Carnegie Melon University in Pittsburgh, told Fox News Digital. Despite this, Lightman said creating a trail between the chatbot's source, and its output, is important to ensure transparency and accuracy. Wu said the world’s readiness for emerging AI technologies would have been more advanced if not for the colossal disruptions caused by the COVID-19 panic. ""AI response was organizing in 2019.

TUCKER CARLSON: The Biden admin's new rule will punish people with high credit scores,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to a new Biden administration rule that will punish Americans with good credit on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' For centuries, politicians in this country assumed that in order to win an election, you had to convince voters to vote for you. You had to make their case. That was called democracy. But the defining strategic insight of the modern Democratic Party is they don't really need to convince anyone of anything. What matters is demographics. To import enough people from elsewhere, people who are financially dependent on you in order to live. That's the story of the state of California. That's why California changed. It's why Texas is changing, but it's also happening at the local level all over the country. Democrats have realized that they win the vote in virtually every major city, but the suburbs remain contested and that matters because suburban voters like school boards and state legislators and, of course, members of Congress. So, if you want total control over the entire country, you need demographic change everywhere, including in the suburbs. This is a very obvious insight and Democrats have been on the case for quite a while. Back in 2009, the Obama administration took the county of Westchester in New York, a solidly Democratic place, to court. Why did they do that? The administration withheld tens of millions of dollars in federal funding unless Westchester pledged to build 10,000 low-income, high-density apartments in their suburbs. MARCIA FUDGE CONFIRMED AS BIDEN'S HUD SECRETARY The Obama administration later implemented a rule requiring suburbs to take ""affirmative steps to diversify their neighborhoods"" or else they would lose federal money. When he took office, Joe Biden threw his support behind something called the Home Act. Among other things, the Home Act would allow the federal government to withhold funds from local governments if they didn't find ways to add high rise apartments or high-density zoning to suburbs. Specifically, the act would have prevented local governments from enacting ""ordinances that ban apartment buildings from certain residential areas or set a minimum lot size for a single-family home."" So, you can't be safe in a leafy suburb anymore. It has to be urbanized. The Home Act has stalled in Congress. It has never become law. But the Biden administration didn't give up just because democracy didn't produce the results they wanted. They still plan to change the suburbs forever by getting rid of them. Joe Biden's HUD secretary, Marcia Fudge, a former member of Congress, explained last year the administration was concerned that African Americans couldn't afford homes not because they're poor, but because home appraisers are racist. Watch. MARCIA FUDGE: What the president has said is that we have to look at everything through the lens of equity and so what we have realized is that people selling homes just as a person, as you were talking about, and even people buying homes, if they are appraisal is not correct, what we find, especially as Black people in communities of color and underserved communities, is we lose great wealth just through the appraisal process. Notice here the seizing of the moral high ground. Big picture, if the Biden administration cared about African Americans, they probably wouldn't withdraw the police from America's cities. So, they of course, they don't care. But in point of fact, former Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, in that clip you just saw, presented no evidence whatsoever that there are White supremacist home appraisers in this country or that they are running amok. If they exist, who are they? Well, she couldn't tell us, but instead she offered this anecdote. FUDGE: I live two doors from an all-White community. I live in an all-Black community. My house is larger than the house two doors for me. My lot is larger than the house, two doors for me, but my house is valued at $25,000 less than the house two doors for me. And so once we can start to address and just own up to the fact that we are continuing to discriminate and red line in our housing efforts, then I think that we can make sure that we can start to deal with the racial wealth gap. Yeah. So as the left is often telling you, an anecdote is not a study. Noticing something around you doesn't make it universally true. You've proved nothing. All you have really told us is a little story. Marcia Fudge's lived experience tells her that there is racism in home appraisals, but there's still no data on that. There's no evidence whatsoever. It is, at this point, completely made up, but Kamala Harris is convinced completely as she was last year. BIDEN RULE WILL REDISTRIBUTE HIGH-RISK LOAN COSTS TO HOMEOWNERS WITH GOOD CREDIT US Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during the Democratic National Committee Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Sept. 30, 2022. (Leigh Vogel/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images) KAMALA HARRIS: The home appraisal workforce is one of the least diverse in our nation. Less than 5% of home appraisers in America are people of color. This lack of diversity can introduce both conscious and unconscious biases that make home appraisals less accurate and less fair. Our administration will now require those who conduct appraisals for federal programs must take part in anti-bias, fair housing, and fair lending training. There are solutions. There are solutions. We're just going to brainwash the home appraisers. We're going to put them in bias training. Really? If you wanted more Black home appraisers, why wouldn't you start a program to train them? No. The only job training program this administration has gotten behind in two and a half years is getting Black people to sell more weed in the cities. Literally. We're legalizing weed. We're going to make sure the weed dispensaries have African-American owners. They are not training any Black people to be home appraisers And by the way, the premise of this is itself unproven that home appraisers are racist. Why do we think that? Again, there's zero evidence. That a slur upon home appraisers. By the way, why do they deserve this abuse? Well, they don't; they're not hurting anyone. They're accounting types. Why is the administration calling them racist? But they are, and they have been for more than a year. So, once again, they're using fake allegations of racism as a pretext for a political plan and in this case, the plan is to flood the suburbs with voters they believe will support the Democratic Party. It's super simple. They don't deserve the moral high ground because we're talking race around or claiming they speak on behalf of Black people. Kamala Harris is claiming to speak on behalf of Black people. Right. OK. That doesn't mean that they're right, but no one's stopping them. So, without any vote in Congress, the Biden administration has just introduced a rule, – not a law, a rule --that will punish Americans who've tried to do the right thing, punish people with high credit scores. The people with high credit scores will pay higher fees on their mortgage payments to subsidize people who haven't maintained good credit. So, these rules take effect on May 1st, whether you like it or not and they mean that anyone with good credit that's defined as a score of 680 or above is going to have to pay roughly $40 a month extra on their mortgage fees than those with lower scores on home loans for around $400 grand. FORMER OBAMA HOUSING CHIEF SLAMS BIDEN’S ‘UNPRECEDENTED’ MORTGAGE PLAN: ‘NOT THE WAY TO DO IT’ So, here's an example. If you have a FICO score of 620, you get a 1.75% discount on your mortgage fees. If you have a 740 score == in other words you pay your bills on time, you've done the right thing, you're a good citizen – you have to pay 1% more. So, you don't get a discount for doing the right thing and paying your bills, you get punished. We are incentivizing bad behavior. We're hurting the good people. Since the day you were born, you have been told, ""Pay your debts. It's not your money. You bought it from somebody else. You have to pay it back. If you don't, it's stealing."" Now we're saying if you don't steal, we're going to hurt you and in real life, that means that over the course of a 30-year mortgage for a $400,000 home, that's a swing of more than $14,000, and they're claiming racism to justify this. Black Americans are the only racial group in this country with average credit scores of under 680. Now, why is that? We don't know. Whites, Hispanics, Asians have higher credit scores. Therefore, as you'd expect, the mortgage style rate for African-American borrowers is higher than the overall population. It’s double in this country's biggest markets, and that's the reason the suburbs have different demographics from the cities. That's called economics. Now, if you wanted to change that, you would encourage people to have good spending habits and pay back their debt. But they don't care about that. Making people happy or getting them out of debt? No, they want to change the suburbs, make them denser so there be more reliably Democratic voting. That's the bottom line. It's always about election results. It's always about power. It's not about improving anybody's life. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party's donors in private equity, of course, are happy. It will be even harder for Americans with good credit to buy homes. Why? Because that will mean more renters. Renters have homes they own. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP LESLEY STAHL: Home ownership is increasingly out of reach. GARY BERMAN, CEO OF TRICON RESIDENTIAL: In our portfolio, the majority cannot buy homes, cannot afford to buy a home or don't have the credit to buy the homes. I think if you asked a lot of millennials and that tends to be our primary resident, they would probably tell you they don't necessarily desire to own a home or to own a car. They've grown up in the sharing economy and for what's important to them is lifestyle, right, and so if they can move into this, what we call a turnkey or hotel ready home and have a low maintenance lifestyle, that's very compelling for them. People don't want even, they don't want to own anything! They want to be penniless and impoverished, live with the whims of oligarchs. That's really what they want. Do you own anything, Mr. Oligarch Guy? She never asked. ",1775,opinion

"Trump campaign cites progressive groups, Joy Reid's blog in attacks on Ron DeSantis","Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has more on former President Trump racking up endorsements on Gov. DeSantis' home turf and the growing GOP 2024 field on 'Your World.' Former President Donald Trump's campaign on Friday launched multiple attacks on Florida Gov.

In a press release titled, ""The Real Ron DeSantis Playbook,"" Trump's campaign cited data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) and the Florida Policy Institute to blast DeSantis for what it said was data showing the state continuing ""to tumble into complete and total delinquency and destruction."" Additionally, Trump later posted on Truth Social with a quote from Reid's Wednesday blog, The ReidOut, which called DeSantis' trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with lawmakers this week a ""charm offensive,"" and ""a massive failure.""

"There have been 1,080 attempts to punish scholars over the past 23 years: Report","A former law professor said university officials need to enforce their own policies after students and educators heckled a judge and stopped his remarks. A free-speech group found that there have been over 1000 attempts to punish scholars over the past 23 years.

Texas advances bill requiring 10 Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms,"Patriot Mobile's Vice President of Public Affairs Leigh Wambsganss and Texas State Senator Bryan Hughes, R, share why they are promoting posters with patriotic messages in their home state of Texas. Texas public schools would be required to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom starting next school year under a bill that was approved by the Texas Senate on Thursday. The legislation, Senate Bill 1515, will now head to the state House for consideration. Texas Republican Sen. Phil King said during a committee hearing earlier this month that he wanted the state to bring the Ten Commandments back into the classroom because they are a crucial part of the American heritage. ""[The bill] will remind students all across Texas of the importance of the fundamental foundation of America,"" King said during the hearing, according to the Texas Tribune. If the bill passed in the Texas Senate, it would be sent to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to be signed into law.  ((Photo by Jana Birchum/Getty Images)) He also said the U.S. Supreme Court signaled the bill was constitutional after it ruled in favor of Joe Kennedy, a high school football coach in Washington state who was fired for praying before games. WEST VIRGINIA ADVANCES PUBLIC SCHOOL MANDATE ON ‘IN GOD WE TRUST’ The proposal comes on the heels of the passage of a law in August that requires schools to display ""In God We Trust"" signs in a ""conspicuous place"" as long as are ""donated"" or ""purchased by private donations"" ""The national motto, In God We Trust, asserts our collective trust in a sovereign God,"" Texas Republican State Sen. Bryan Hughes, who sponsored the legislation, wrote on Twitter. ""I co-authored the bill in 2003 that allowed schools to display the motto, and last year I authored the ‘In God We Trust Act,’ which requires a school to display the motto if there is no cost associated with the display."" The Senate also gave final passage to Senate Bill 1396, which would allow public and charter schools to adopt a policy that would set aside time for students and employees to pray and read religious texts like the Bible at school. CHURCH LEADERS MOSTLY SILENT AFTER TEEN WHO OPPOSED TRANSGENDER SUSPENDED FROM CATHOLIC SCHOOL Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, R., applauded both pieces of legislation as wins for religious liberty in the state. ""Allowing the Ten Commandments and prayer back into our public schools is one step we can take to make sure that all Texans have the right to freely express their sincerely held religious beliefs,"" he said in a statement. The Supreme Court heard two cases on whether Ten Commandments monuments should be displayed on government properties in 2005.  ((Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)) ""I believe that you cannot change the culture of the country until you change the culture of mankind,"" he added. ""Bringing the Ten Commandments and prayer back to our public schools will enable our students to become better Texans."" The Senate also passed Bill 1556, which would codify the Supreme Court’s ruling on the high school football coach into law and protect the right of school employees to engage in religious speech or prayer ""while on duty.""

Journalist Matt Taibbi fires back at Democrats after threatening letter: 'Have they all gone mad?',"'Twitter Files' journalist Matt Taibbi and MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan clashed over Taibbi's reporting in a contentious interview. Matt Taibbi fired back at a Democrat who sent him a letter suggesting he could face prison time after his contentious congressional testimony last month, saying the party as a whole had lost its mind. ""At the moment I still can’t quite wrap my head around this, and hope others will be able to make more sense of it. I’d laugh, but I have three kids, and these people might be serious. It’s like waking up in a H.U.A.C. hearing. Have they all gone mad?"" he asked. Taibbi, one of several journalists behind the ""Twitter Files,"" received a letter from Democratic Rep. Stacey Plaskett, suggesting he could be sent to prison for perjury based on remarks he made last month before a House subcommittee about government weaponization. ""I learned yesterday Virgin Islands Delegate and Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government Stacey Plaskett is threatening me with prison, over her own error,"" he wrote in a piece headlined, ""House Democrats Have Lost Their Minds.""

Journalist Matt Taibbi refused to reveal a source during a heated House Judiciary Committee hearing on Twitter Files.  (Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage) ""It would be one thing if I really made the mistake. In that case, Plaskett’s letter would merely be an outrageous attempt to intimidate a witness by threatening a charge of intentional lying over a miscue. But that’s not the case,"" Taibbi wrote. ""I did of course make an error, but what Plaskett is referencing is actually a mistake by Hasan, one she’s now repeating. I’m not sure what to do but explain and show this as clearly as possible."" He added further detail about how two major institutions with similar acronyms could be so easily mixed up, due partly to how closely they work together. ""I did in a tweet conflate the Center for American Security (CIS) with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), saying that CISA was so close to Stanford’s Election Integrity Project (EIP) that Twitter staffers didn’t really distinguish between them,"" he wrote. ""This happened precisely because the agencies were hand-in-glove partners, and I’d seen so many communications about their cooperation that I lost track of some acronyms. I even tweeted months before, in TwitterFiles #6, that the agencies CIS and CISA were easily confused, because both worked with the EIP and CIS was a DHS contractor."" Rep. Stacey Plaskett (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) JOURNALIST MATT TAIBBI THREATENED WITH PRISON TIME FOR PERJURY BY TOP DEMOCRAT OVER TWITER FILES TESTIMONY After writing further details about ties between the CIS and CISA, Taibbi went on to lament how this latest controversy says more about the state of the American government than it does about his integrity as a journalist. ""This means that when Plaskett writes it was ‘misinformation’ for me to be ‘alleging that CISA — a government entity — was working with the EIP to have posts removed from social media,’ she herself is engaging in misinformation. It may be an unintentional mistake, as she certainly seems capable of not knowing or caring to know underlying reality, but it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding,"" he wrote. ""Only a person totally unfamiliar with the issue could believe that CISA/DHS were not closely involved with content moderation at Twitter, to say nothing of other companies. Both she and Mehdi are wrong about this, and make their accusation in defiance of a lot of obvious documentary evidence.""

What the Times still does is one of the last relics of the old honor system, under which journalists implicitly promise to try their hardest not to screw up, and readers agree to trust them, so long as they can see editors and their charges admitting their errors."" ""Unfortunately there’s a new model, in which news organizations don’t address errors or audience complaints at all,"" he wrote. ""It’s from just such a media institution that Plaskett — while herself making an easily checkable mistake — got the idea to threaten prison for the kind of blunder we once would have consigned to the corrections page without a thought.""

Former college volleyball player hits back at soccer star Megan Rapinoe's 'absurd' stance on trans athletes,"Former division one athlete Adriana McLamb discusses the fight for fairness in women's sports. A former college volleyball player spoke out Friday against Democrats and high-profile female athletes who refuse to protect women's sports from transgender competitors. In June 2022 in honor of the anniversary of Title IX, U.S. Women's Soccer superstar Megan Rapinoe offered her take on the backlash towards transgender athletes in women's sports. ""I would also encourage everyone out there who is afraid someone’s going to have an unfair advantage over their kid to really take a step back and think what are we actually talking about here. We’re talking about people’s lives. I’m sorry, your kid’s high school volleyball team just isn’t that important. It’s not more important than any one kid’s life,"" Rapinoe told TIME. Adriana McLamb, a former Division I athlete at Rutgers and FIU, blasted the ""absurd"" comments. ""I think it's actually kind of absurd because we do care, especially as a volleyball player. We very much do care about your daughter's high school volleyball team,"" McLamb said on ""Fox & Friends"" Friday. MEGAN RAPINOE ‘100% SUPPORTIVE OF TRANS INCLUSION,’ IMPLORES PEOPLE TO LOOK AT ISSUE MORE BROADLY ""Especially in the case of Payton McNabb, who actually testified this week in North Carolina, who is severely concussed and injured by a biological man on the other side of a net. So we very much do care because this is not just about it being unfair for female athletes, but we're getting to the point that's unsafe."" McNabb, a senior at Hiwassee Dam High School in Murphy, N.C., said she suffered significant and long-term physical and mental injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a biological male who was able to compete on a girls’ team because of a policy put in place by the state’s high school athletic association. ""I'm here for every biological female athlete behind me. My little sister, my cousins, my teammates. Allowing biological males to compete against biological females is dangerous. I may be the first to come before you with an injury, but if this doesn't pass I won't be the last,"" she said during a press conference Wednesday, speaking out for the first time since her injuries. ESPN PERSONALITIES SLAM BIDEN'S TITLE IX PROPOSAL AMID UPROAR OVER TRANSGENDER ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTS McNabb called on state legislators to pass t​​he Fairness in Women's Sports Act that would prohibit biological males from competing on girls’ sports teams, citing her own experience. That same day, the act was passed by a 73-39 vote, with three Democrats supporting the measure. The debate surrounding transgender athletes in women's sports has grown heated especially since swimmer Lia Thomas started competing against biological women in 2021. Republicans have become staunch opponents of normalizing transgender athletes from competing against the opposite biological sex. ""How we got here was we've actually been saying this for a while. You had athletes like Selina Soule a few years back, and then the pinnacle was last year when Riley Gaines, another spokeswoman for IWC, competed against Lia Thomas. And we're now seeing it more and more common that we are seeing biological males and females sports,"" McLamb said. ""It's going to be the end of women's sports if we don't stop it."" On Thursday, the House of Representatives took a decisive stance on the debate passing the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. The act, also called the ""Save Women's Sports"" bill, was passed in a narrow 219-203 vote, with all Republicans voting ""yes"" and all Democrats voting ""no."" ""This bill isn't an anti-trans.

There's reasons why the net is higher. There's a difference in baseball and softball fields.

Veterans Affairs medical facilities to continue to provide taxpayer funded abortions after close Senate vote,"Former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy gives his take on the Trump indictment and the Supreme Court extending access to an abortion drug on 'The Story.' The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical facilities will continue to provide abortions on taxpayers' dime after a vote to overturn the rule failed on Wednesday. The resolution put forth by Republican Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville in February to stop the VA from providing taxpayer-funded abortions at its medical facilities failed to advance for a final vote, 48-51. Two Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats to block the Senate from voting on the legislation's final passage.

Michael Cloud, introduced the bicameral joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse the rule, which they argued broke both state and federal laws. Before the rule went into effect, abortions were not covered under the VAs medical benefits. The CRA gives Congress the authority to review major rules issued by federal agencies before they take effect and if it disapproves of a rule, the rule doesn't stand. ""Last year, the VA announced they would begin providing taxpayer-funded abortions. Last year. This is something the VA has never, ever done before. Let me repeat that,"" Sen. Tuberville said during his remarks on the resolution. ""The VA has never done abortions. In fact, the VA has been prohibited — by the body — from performing abortions at its facilities for more than 30 years. The 102nd Congress — 1991 and 1992 — made taxpayer-funded abortions at VA facilities illegal … They did this with the bipartisan Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.

""PSSI repeatedly implored NBC News to identify the individual in question before airing this segment to help us investigate the matter and enforce our long-standing, zero-tolerance policy against employing anyone under 18. Unfortunately, NBC refused to do so, leading the network to recklessly broadcast a false story,"" PSSI said. It began on April 12 when ""NBC Nightly News"" ran a segment to accompany an online report that said a 16-year-old migrant anonymously identified simply as ""Pedro"" spoke out against the dangers of working the overnight shift cleaning a slaughterhouse. NBC News was forced to issue a humiliating retraction this week after falsely reporting a slaughterhouse employed an underage migrant worker. NBC NEWS’ QUIET REMOVAL OF ‘WEINSTEIN’S BEST PR PERSON’ NOAH OPPENHEIM RAISES INDUSTRY EYEBROWS ""That hazardous work, illegal for anyone under 18,"" reporter Julia Ainsley said as NBC showed viewers unnerving images of bloody floors of the PSSI slaughterhouse in Dodge City, Kansas. ""Where they kill the cows, I have to clean the blood of the cows, until I finish,"" the man referred to as Pedro said. The NBC News reporter then said Pedro’s shift ends with ""just enough time"" for him to shower and make it to high school. ""Pedro says he has been working there since he was 15,"" Ainsley said before noting that PSSI previously settled with the U.S. Labor Dept. after investigators uncovered underage workers. NBC NEWS PRESIDENT SAYS HIS NETWORK DOES NOT DO 'ADVOCACY JOURNALISM' ""As part of its settlement, PSSI pledged it would no longer hire children and paid a $1.5 million fine… but Pedro is still on the job,"" the reporter said. Ainsley ended by noting that PSSI was looking to find the real identity of the man referred to as Pedro, because the company didn’t want any minors illegally working for it. The problem for NBC News was that Pedro was not a 16-year-old boy despite what the network told viewers. NBC News posted an embarrassing editor’s note atop the updated online story. ""This article replaces one published by NBC News on April 12, 2023, about a migrant worker at a Kansas slaughterhouse. That article has been withdrawn in light of new information that the migrant is not a minor,"" NBC News editors wrote. NBC News’ updated story began by reporting a ""Guatemalan migrant who claimed he worked as a minor cleaning a slaughterhouse in Kansas by night while attending high school during the day is actually 21, NBC News has learned."" NBC'S LESTER HOLT SAYS WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR BOTH SIDES TO DEFINE THE TRUTH: ‘FAIRNESS IS OVERRATED’ Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI) blasted NBC in a statement following the concerning retraction, saying the network ""recklessly"" broadcasted inaccurate information that could have been avoided if it simply worked with the company. NBC corrected its online story on Wednesday, before ""NBC Nightly News"" aired. However, the network didn’t address the gaffe on air until Thursday with a brief mention by anchor Lester Holt. ""We want to update you on a report we brought you last week. NBC News has learned a Guatemalan migrant featured in a ‘Nightly News’ story who said he was a minor while working overnight cleaning at a slaughterhouse in Kansas is actually 21 years old. The young man had initially told NBC News and the U.S. government he was 16,"" Holt said before quickly moving on. PSSI said that after the segment ran, the company immediately reviewed its entire workforce to search for the individual claiming to be a minor. ""When our investigation found this individual, we interviewed him and he said was not a minor. NBC News has since admitted he is 21 years old. This individual said he left Guatemala a year ago and was detained by U.S. border officials when crossing into America. To obtain release, he said he presented his younger brother’s birth certificate to falsely claim he was underage — given the federal government’s policy of letting unaccompanied minors stay in the country,"" PSSI said in a statement. ""According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they have caught hundreds of adults falsely claiming to be minors to avoid deportation. When this individual applied to work at PSSI, he presented false identification that cleared the federal government’s own E-Verify system. However, our investigation found no evidence that he is a minor — contrary to NBC News’ report,"" PSSI continued. ""We presented the findings of our investigation to NBC News and reserve all our legal rights."" WOMEN’S GROUP CALLS FOR DEMS TO PULL MSNBC DEBATE AMID ‘CULTURE OF SEXUAL ABUSE’ AT NBC NEWS PSSI continues to insist it has a zero-tolerance policy against employing anyone under the age of 18. It's the latest instance of the network having to admit a significant error. NBC mysteriously retracted reporter Miguel Almaguer’s November story that suggested Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, might not have been in immediate danger when police arrived at his San Francisco home the night he was assaulted by suspect David DePape. ""Miguel f----d up,"" an NBC News insider said at the time. ""It’s not clear that he had anything approaching two sources, and it’s not clear that the first source was more than a tip."" NBC News has not publicly explained what was wrong with the retracted report aside from a brief line that it didn’t meet standards. Media watchdogs have called for greater transparency from NBC to no avail. The bodycam footage of the attack that came out this year confirmed some aspects of NBC's report, but contradicted a key claim that Pelosi walked several feet back toward his eventual assailant after police arrived.

University students suing sorority for allowing trans member ordered to reveal their names,"Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk reacts to a Forbes report saying undergraduate college degree rates are dropping for the first time in a decade on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Several female University of Wyoming students who have filed a lawsuit against sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma's University of Wyoming chapter for allowing a biological man to be a member, have been ordered by a U.S. District Court judge to reveal their identities to pursue their suit in court. Six of the original seven plaintiffs complied with the order and have revealed their names to the public this week. Their names are ""Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar,"" a local Wyoming outlet reported.

Johnson ruled against both, ordering them ""to reveal their names if they wanted to continue the lawsuit,"" Cowboy State Daily claimed on Thursday. The women still pursuing legal action, all current students of the school and members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, are suing the sorority for letting transgender woman Artemis Langford into the university's chapter last September. The central complaint in the students’ suit argues that ""sorority officers broke a contract with them and breached their fiduciary duty to the sorority itself"" in their ""efforts to help induct transgender member Artemis Langford into the sorority’s University of Wyoming chapter last September,"" the outlet said. It added, ""Sorority leaders’ efforts betrayed the women’s understanding of what they were joining and the sorority’s own guiding documents, the lawsuit alleges."" As Fox News Digital reported last month, the lawsuit alleges that ""21-year-old Artemis Langford, has been ‘watching’ the female members of the sorority house."" It also ""alleged that during one of these peeping incidents, Langford had a visible ‘erection.’"" COLLEGE DEGREE VALUE PLUMMETS AS WOKE INSANITY SPIKES LGBTQ person holds pins about gender pronouns on the University of Wyoming campus on August 13, 2022.

One account of Langford’s alleged harassment in the lawsuit detailed that, as one of the female members ""walked down the hall to take a shower, wearing only a towel… She felt an unsettling presence, turned, and saw Mr. Smith watching her silently."" The woman also provided evidence from Langford’s Tinder dating app account that he is ""sexually interested in women."" Their suit also detailed how he has ""repeatedly questioned the women about what vaginas look like, breast cup size, whether women were considering breast reductions and birth control."" Feminist outlet Reduxx reported that though Langford has not moved into the sorority house officially, he is ""set to move into the residence within the year, where he would have access to the shared shower facilities."" In addition to suing the sorority, the now-named students are also suing Langford, though they are only seeking that the court voids the trans woman’s sorority membership, rather than seeking monetary damages. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Their original lawsuit had referred to Langford by the pseudonym ""Terry Smith"" as the plaintiffs wanted ""to spare Langford of threats and attacks, and hope to see Langford treated with kindness and respect,"" the local outlet noted.

"Three Florida Republicans picking Trump over DeSantis, believe he can win 2024 rematch against Biden","Florida Republican Reps. Cory Mills, Greg Steube, and Byron Donalds shared their opinions on the potential presidential bid from Ron DeSantis Some Florida Republicans are coming out to show their support for former President Trump for president in 2024. Reps. Cory Mills, Greg Steube, and Byron Donalds joined ""America's Newsroom"" to explain their support for Trump over their home state Gov. Ron DeSantis, who many predict will enter the race. Steube said that in five years, Governor DeSantis has not reached out to him personally. ""There's been multiple opportunities where I have gone up to him and talked to him, giving him my cell phone number, asked him to reach out to me. There have been events in my district that I was specifically in, told I couldn't be part of the press conference, told to go stand in the corner, was not allowed to be participating in that when he was in my district,"" he told Bill Hemmer. WHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE On policy, Steube said he believes in the ""America First agenda"" and trusts that Trump is the one who can get the job done. ""There is no other candidate for the Republican nominee that can go in day one and do what we need to have done in our country and reverse all the disastrous policies of this Biden administration. And that is President Trump, said Stuebe. ""I am looking forward to fighting on Team Trump."" Donalds said his endorsement is not about DeSantis but based on his belief in Trump's record as president previously. ""You got to be able to hit the ground running on day one. We know Donald Trump can do it. He did it once before, he can do it again. If you look at our country from a foreign policy perspective, we know all the domestic issues. China is on the move, they see weakness at the White House. The next commander-in-chief has got to be able to do the job of commander-in-chief on day one. We know Donald Trump can do that job."" Mills said Democrats and the mainstream media know Trump can defeat Biden this time around. ""The reason they're going after President Trump is because he is the one who can actually defeat Joe Biden in the White House, take back our country, get it back on track, and start actually leading the country where it needs to go. They know that and that's why they're coming after him. But America stands behind President Trump."" Biden has not officially announced he will run for re-election, but told a reporter last week in Ireland that his ""plan is to run again."" Steube said in his district near Sarasota, Florida, Trump has overwhelming support over other candidates, including DeSantis. Donalds said this race would be different from 2020. ""What I believe is you're going to have President Trump and President Biden in front of these voters. And the simple question is who did the job better? And it is without question that Donald Trump did a significantly better job than what Joe Biden is doing currently. That's going to be your question in '24. And I think that suburban moms looking at inflation, looking at the indoctrination that's happening in our schools, they're going to say, you know what? These Democrats have led us the completely wrong way."" Mills said, ""Governor DeSantis has done a great job as governor, but President Trump has shown to be a great president."" The launch of Trump's third straight presidential campaign in November was followed by only a trickle of endorsements from Republican members of Congress. However, as Trump's position as the clear front-runner in the burgeoning 2024 Republican presidential nomination race has become more pronounced this spring, the pace of congressional endorsements has accelerated. He can now boast the backing of roughly 50 House Republicans and nine GOP senators. He also enjoys the backing of Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, the state that holds the third contest in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

The company's Budweiser ad features one of the brand's famous Clydesdale horses traversing the country from New York City to the Grand Canyon, passing by scenes in the American heartland as a narrator delivers a patriotic message. Critics said the commercial was a transparent attempt to clean up the company's image after it lost customers angry about the Mulvaney partnership.

‘Radical feminists’ torch Democrats for opposing women's sports legislation: 'This is a pro-girl bill',"Kara Dansky and Lierre Keith discuss why they, self-described radical feminists, support Republicans bill that would ban transgender women from competing against females. `Two self-described ""radical feminists"" joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Friday to voice their support for House Republicans' ""Protection of Women and Girls in Sports"" bill. The bill would ban transgender women from competing in federally funded schools’ female sports teams. More specifically, it claims that allowing trans women to play in female sports violates Title IX, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex. A transgender woman refers to someone who was born with male sex traits and now identifies as a woman. The bill received no votes from any House Democrats and is not expected to move forward in the Democrat-led Senate.

""This is a pro-girl bill. We know that men and women have different physical capacities,"" said Keith. ""For there to be any fairness for girls, we have to keep boys out of women’s sports."" She added, ""Women have a right to a word for ourselves, and that word is woman, and men can't have it.

"Trans woman showered with four Wisconsin high school girls, violated their privacy, letter to district claims","Riley Gaines, who swam against UPenn's Lia Thomas, says including transgender athletes into women's sports shows 'utter disregard' toward females on 'The Ingraham Angle.' A letter sent by a law group on Thursday claimed that the Wisconsin-based Sun Praire Area School District [SPASD] has not ""adequately"" addressed a violation of students’ privacy rights after a transgender woman walked into a shower with four high school freshmen girls inside of it. The letter, written by the Wisconsin Institute of Law and Liberty (WILL) urges a response by the SPASD to resolve the issue and claims its actions have ""been completely inadequate."" ""We are calling on you to address this immediately and put policies in place that will protect the safety and privacy of all students (and provide public notice of what those policies are),"" WILL attorneys wrote. Fox News Digital saw an email from the Sun Prairie East High School principal that acknowledged the incident and said the situation should have never happened. (iStock) According to the letter, titled ""Serious Violation of Girls’ Privacy Rights in Sun Prairie East Locker Room,"" four Sun Prairie East High School freshmen girls were disturbed when an alleged ""undressed"" 18-year-old transgender woman came into the locker room and got into the showers with the girls. RILEY GAINES RIPS BIDEN ADMIN AS LIA THOMAS EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR TITLE IX CHANGES WILL attorneys’ letter claims that on March 3, four freshmen girls at EHS participated in a swim unit as part of their first-hour physical education class. After the class, the girls entered the girls’ athletic locker room to shower and change for class. However, upon entering, they noticed the transgender student, a senior, in the area containing lockers and benches. WILL claim that the transgender student was 18 years old at the time of the incident. The girls said that the transgender student was not in the first-hour PE class they were participating in. The letter went on to say that the girls were surprised to see the transgender student in the locker room, although it additionally notes that they knew that the student identifies as transgender and had used girls’ bathrooms before. The girls proceeded to use the shower without interacting with the transgender student. Furthermore, WILL claimed that the girls entered the shower area with their swimsuits on to rinse off, a practice that is common after swimming in PE class. Moreover, the letter alleges that the transgender student entered the girls’ shower area, approached them, and announced ""I’m trans, by the way.""

""He was initially turned towards the wall but eventually turned and fully exposed his male genitalia to the four girls."" The incident was first reported to student services. WILL argues that the SPASD's actions following the first report were not sufficient to resolve the issue. They asserted that ""SPASD did not follow its own policy in this instance regarding District Response to Alleged Sexual Harassment."" WILL wrote, ""Under federal law, the incident should have been reported to the Title IX coordinator, who should have then contacted the girls, offered supportive measures, and provided them an opportunity to file a complaint."" They explain further, ""Supportive measures might have included accommodations to maintain their access to education and adequate privacy in the locker room at least while a Title IX investigation was pending. No one from the District contacted any of the girls’ parents at that time, and no one investigated. To be clear, that means that the District’s initial response to this incident violated Title IX.""

In the exchange, the stroke survivor admitted that during his time away he felt like he was ""not the kind of senator"" that his state deserved, and that he was not the family man he should have been. He also noted some of the advice doctors gave him to treat his depression, including staying away from news and social media. SEN.

Fetterman is returning to the Senate following six weeks of treatment for clinical depression. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Although Fetterman could not serve in full capacity at the beginning of his term — something even mainstream media warned about due to his rocky recovery from a stroke last year — the outlet turned it into a plus. The interview began with praise for Fetterman’s ""transparency"" on mental health issues that he portrayed throughout his treatment for depression. NPR stated, ""Fetterman's public acknowledgment of his own mental health struggles is rare for politicians, even as depression has become an increasingly common challenge for Americans."" It then added, ""With his transparency, Fetterman has created a platform for discussing mental health issues, and encouraged other politicians to share their own stories."" The outlet asked Fetterman about his feelings on returning to the Senate, to which he replied he was happy. He claimed his reaction was ""just a big smile,"" and added, ""I’ve really missed being here."" Fetterman also acknowledged that his health problems derailed him as a senator, husband and father. He said, ""And when I was in the throes of depression, if I was being 100% honest, I was not the kind of senator that was deserved by Pennsylvanians. I wasn't the kind of partner that I owe to my wife, Gisele, or to my children, Karl, Grace, and August."" SEN. FETTERMAN TWEETS IMAGE HOLDING 420 FLAG TO ACKNOWLEDGE CANNABIS HOLIDAY Sen.

I didn't even understand it. This, to me, just became the new normal. I wasn't realizing [that] I wasn't eating. I didn't realize that I wasn't really drinking much."" He also admitted, ""I dropped 25 pounds. And sometimes I would say things, incoherent things, and I would become kind of just [disoriented], and getting lost walking around in Washington."" Fetterman also mentioned his hesitation when given the option of being treated for depression, saying, ""They knew that I wasn't right. But even at that moment, I still kind of pushed back about it, too, sometimes saying, 'Are you sure, I don't really need it.'"" The senator drew on his own experience to encourage others to get help if they think they might need it, saying, ""Get treatment, and get help. If I'd had done that years ago, I would not have had to put my family and myself and my colleagues [through] that if I had gotten help."" Fetterman also shared some guidance the doctors gave him for his recovery.

"ESPN hosts break with liberals on trans women in sports, Disney-owned network ‘chooses to remain woke’","OutKick host Charly Arnolt discusses her decision to leave ESPN as top female hosts on the network speak out on the need to protect women athletes. In recent years, ESPN has become synonymous with liberal talking points as the Disney-owned network regularly pushes left-leaning ideology when it ventures into politics. That’s why it was so shocking when two of its biggest stars criticized the Biden administration’s plan to block states from banning transgender students from competing against the gender they identify as. ESPN personalities Samantha Ponder and Sage Steele, two of the network’s most prominent women, expressed support for Riley Gaines, a former decorated NCAA swimmer at Kentucky who has been an outspoken critic of biological men being allowed to compete against biological women. ""Women with influential platforms are beginning to speak out to the injustice of men competing against women. These women in particular have a lot to lose by using their voice, yet chose to anyways. That is what courage is. I'm so honored to be able to lean on them as we continue forward with advocating for sex-protected sporting categories,"" Gaines told Fox News Digital. Steele declared that she stands with Gaines and called what has occurred with trans people overtaking women’s sports ""ridiculous,"" ""heartbreaking,"" ""difficult to watch"" and added the hashtag ""savewomensports.""

""It is a shame that we are needing to fight for the integrity of Title IX in 2023 and the reason it was needed in the first place,"" Ponder wrote. ESPN’s Samantha Ponder expressed support for Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer who has been an outspoken critic of transgender women being allowed to compete against biological women.  (Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM) Adriana McLamb, a spokeswoman for the Independent Women’s Forum and former Division 1 volleyball player, believes Gaines and other like-minded female athletes are on the right side of history in the debate over trans athletes. ""It is promising to see big names like Sage Steele and Sam Ponder speak out even though their employer ESPN chooses to remain woke,"" McLamb told Fox News Digital. ""Now more than ever, it is important for us as female athletes to rally behind Riley Gaines and fight for Title IX,"" McLamb continued. ""We are fighting for all current and future female athletes to compete on a fair playing field just like our predecessors fought for our right to compete to begin with."" Ex-ESPN personality Charly Arnolt, who joined OutKick earlier this month, believes she was ""a little bit stifled"" at her former company. She left to have the freedom to express herself about important issues such as the trans debate. ""I have to commend these two women for standing up for these women who, unfortunately, are losing so much of the success that they worked so hard for,"" Arnolt said Thursday on ""America’s Newsroom."" ESPNs Sage Steele also expressed support for Riley Gaines. (Meg Oliphant/Getty Images) ""As far as ESPN, I don’t really know what their plan is, as far as whether they talk to these women or address it on-air,"" Arnolt continued. ""I would hope that this would be something they would address, but up to this point they remain completely mum on this topic, so I’m not sure exactly what happens."" ESPN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ponder and Steele supporting Gaines. The ESPN anchors spoke out this week when Gaines tweeted criticism of a video made by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who donned a shirt that said, ""trans athletes belong in sports,"" and insisted ""trans kids"" will continue ""losing opportunities"" unless the Biden administration forces change. ""Under the guise of competitive fairness? Are you really trying to say you would have won a national title against the men? Does it not break your heart to see women lose out on these opportunities? The Biden Admins proposed bill denies science, truth, and common sense,"" Gaines wrote to accompany Thomas’ video. ESPN SILENT FOLLOWING 'SICK AND EVIL' COMMENT COMPARING US VOTING RIGHTS ISSUES TO CHINA HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ""This take is selfish and shows an utter disregard for women,"" Gaines continued. ""The Biden Administration is actively and aggressively working to pass laws that erase decent and fair treatment for women in sports."" Ponder and Steele first expressed their support by responding to Gaines’ tweet. Gaines, now a spokeswoman for the Independent Women’s Forum, famously tied Thomas for fifth place in the 200 Freestyle finals at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships last year. Thomas’ situation sparked a national debate over whether transgender woman should be permitted to compete in sports against biological women. The GOP-controlled House on Thursday passed legislation aimed at preventing biological males from competing as transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s sports at schools across the country, after a debate in which several Democrats accused Republicans of ""bullying"" transgender students. The bill is certain to die in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Gaines’ side-eye glare at Thomas became a flashpoint for the polarizing debate, and the former Kentucky swimmer has since emerged as a conservative icon for speaking out. ESPN has fawned over Thomas, even celebrating the trans swimmer during Women’s History Month. Riley Gaines, now a spokeswoman for the Independent Women’s Forum, famously tied Lia Thomas for fifth place in the 200 Freestyle finals at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships last year.  (Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports) ""The Texas native competed for three seasons on the men’s swim team at the University of Pennsylvania. She began her transition after her sophomore season, and after a gap year due to the pandemic… Thomas made her debut as a member of the women’s team in December 2021,"" ESPN’s narrator gushed as uplifting music played and a ""celebrating women’s history month"" graphic appeared on-screen. OutKick founder Clay Travis, who points out ESPN’s liberal messaging on a regular basis, praised Steele and Ponder for offering ""significant"" support of Gaines and biological females. ""Most people in sports media, who are men or women, don’t make substantial enough money to feel like they have great job security and so when you actually break this down, I give credit to Riley Gaines, I give credit to Sage Steele, Sam Ponder for being able to speak out, and willing to speak out,"" Travis said on ""OutKick the Show."" ""A lot of people are terrified of being labeled transphobic, or potentially losing their jobs, that they aren’t willing to speak out about this,"" Travis continued. ""I give credit to Sam Ponder; I give credit to Sage Steele… but they’re still the minority."" ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro landed the top job after his predecessor, John Skipper, shocked the media industry by suddenly resigning in late 2017 when a drug dealer attempted to extort him. The Skipper era saw ESPN take a dramatic turn to the left, and the network was accused of spending too much time glorifying Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protests and spouting left-wing talking points. ESPN'S SAGE STEELE PULLED OFF AIR AFTER KNOCKING COMPANY'S VACCINE MANDATE, COMMENTS ON OBAMA'S RACE Pitaro initially encouraged ESPN talent to pivot away from the political rhetoric that plagued the network during Skipper’s tenure, but a variety of racial and political topics have taken center stage on the self-described ""Worldwide Leader in Sports."" In recent memory, ESPN's Sarah Spain called some Tampa Bay Rays players ""bigots"" for not wearing a gay pride patch because of religious views, aired host Malika Andrews becoming emotional on-air after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and posted a segment online in which host Elle Duncan urged fathers to speak up so their daughters can have abortions. ESPN regular J.A. Adande compared ongoing human rights abuses committed by China to Republican election overhaul efforts in the U.S. when speaking about the Winter Olympics in Beijing, and star NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski sent a profane message to Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ESPN even had a moment of silence to protest Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, which was been dubbed the ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill by Democrats who falsely claim it banned any discussion pertaining to being gay in the state's schools. ""I’m glad that Sam Ponder and Sage Steele, who have strong contracts and who are among the most prominent women employees at ESPN are speaking out, but I wish there was more freedom and lack of fear in this country to allow more to speak out,"" Travis said.

Grieving mother comes face-to-face with Mayorkas: 'I should not have had to bury my little girl',"Elisa Tambunga and Gin Jespersen, family members of Emilia and Maria Tambunga, discuss DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' apology after a fatal car accident involving border smugglers fleeing police. At a House hearing this week, a Texas Republican lawmaker made DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas stand up and face a grieving family who lost a grandmother and young girl in a fatal vehicle crash involving a smuggler who was fleeing authorities near the border. Elisa Tambunga, who lost her seven-year-old daughter, and Gin Jespersen, who lost her mother, joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Friday to describe being face-to-face with Mayorkas after tragedy hit their family. Mayorkas stood up and offered his condolences to the family after being prompted by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas. BORDER PATROL CHIEF SAYS DHS DOESN'T HAVE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF US BORDER ""Honestly, it was asked of him. He didn't do it because he thought it was right. It was asked for by Mr. Pfluger for him to do that. And at this point, not just Secretary Mayorkas, but no one's apologies mean anything to me or to my family without any action behind it,"" said Tambunga. She clarified that she received a sincere apology from Mayorkas in their private meeting, but she viewed the apology during the hearing as insincere. Family members of 71-year-old Maria Tambunga and Emilia Tambunga, who were killed in a car crash involving a suspected human smuggler, attend a House Homeland Security Committee hearing where Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testified, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. (House Homeland Security Committee) Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas was testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee when he was asked to apologize to the family of Maria and Emilia Tambunga, who were killed last month. ""They're sitting right behind you. They came here today because they want answers. They came here today because of the failures of you and your leadership. They came here because they want closure,"" said Pfluger. Mayorkas did stand and express condolences to the Tambunga family present — although he also accused Pfluger of politicizing the tragedy. Jespersen said her family has been trying for a while to get the attention of Mayorkas. Emilia Brooke Tambunga, left, and her grandmother, Maria Socorro Alvarez-Tambunga.  (Preddy Funeral Home) ""In the private meeting, we asked him to come in and sit with us and get to know us and to really own what we were saying. We were adamant that we needed troops down there and the accident, the killing … happened because there is no Texas DPS over the Interstate of Crockett County in Ozona Texas,"" said Jespersen. The family is taking action and urging Mayorkas to make a change. ""We asked him for troops. We asked him to partner with the Democrats and the Republicans. We said we're not about red or blue today. We're not about who's wrong or right. We're about working together. And we said, under your leadership, it's not working."" ""It's just everywhere in all of South Texas, in our hometown. It's everywhere. And we need his help. We need his leadership. We need him to step up to the plate and own up to his role."" HOMELAND DEMS BOOKED TRAVEL, CALLED WITNESSES BEFORE PULLING OUT OF BORDER HEARING, REPUBLICANS SAY Tambunga said she shared graphic pictures of her daughter and urged Mayorkas to understand the significance of his role. ""I just plead with him to please hear us out. And that when he goes to advise President Biden that instead of having the congressman's and congresswoman's thoughts in the back of his mind to have our faces in the back of his mind because that's who ultimately he's needing to protect is us."" ""I should not have had to bury my seven-year-old little girl. I should not have had to see her covered in blood. I should not have had to hold her cold little body."" The Texas Department of Public Safety said Rassian Comer, 22, of Louisiana, ran a red light during a high-speed chase on eastbound I-10 in Ozona and crashed into Maria Tambunga's car. Two of the 11 illegal migrants being smuggled in Comer's 2021 Dodge pickup truck were also killed in the crash, Texas DPS said. Both were from Mexico.

Jordan torches Biden: He made Hunter laptop intel letter 'seem organic' after Blinken outed as 'impetus',"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan sounds off on 'The Ingraham Angle' following Morell testimony, claims from IRS official's lawyer. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said then-candidate Joe Biden wrongly made the letter from 51 intelligence officials claiming Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation ""seem organic"" despite allegedly knowing his soon-to-be State Department chief helped ""strategize"" it. The letter, signed by 51 individuals — including Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan, Bush-era CIA Director Michael Hayden, former DNI James Clapper, former CIA chief of staff Jeremy Bash, former acting CIA Director Michael Morell and former National Intelligence Council Chair Thomas Finger — asserted the laptop had ""classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."" Morell testified before Jordan's committee and that of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, that then-Biden campaign adviser Antony Blinken was ""the impetus"" behind the October 2020 letter's inception. ""When the story came out on Oct. 14, 2020, about the ‘Biden business operation’ and whether then-Vice President Joe Biden was involved, there was some concern that he was — then quickly it turns into this political operation — that letter that became the basis for suppressing the story and keeping it from the American people just days before the most important election we have,"" Jordan said.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ""The 14th, the [New York] Post has a story. The 17th, Tony Blinken… contacts Mike Morell and gets him interested in this. Mike Morell looks at it the next day, organizes on the 18th all these other people to sign the letter. The 19th, the letter goes out."" Jordan added Morell concocted the letter in time for the NBC presidential debate on Oct. 22 because he thought then-President Donald Trump would bring up the laptop issue, which he did. Morell and Blinken wanted a statement Joe Biden could use to rebut Trump's likely allegations, ""because, as Mr. Morell said, they wanted [Biden] to win,"" he continued. The laptop indeed did come up, to which Biden cited the letter, and Trump wondered aloud if the public was to believe the laptop was therefore another ""Russia, Russia, Russia [hoax].""

(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts) Jordan later claimed Biden Presidential Campaign Chairman Steven Ricchetti called Morell after the fact and thanked him for his work. ""It was a total political operation, and the most important fact is [the letter] was false. [The laptop] wasn't Russian disinformation. The laptop story looks to be true."" Jordan and host Laura Ingraham said Trump's stated concern the letter was politicized turned out to be correct. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The way then-Vice President Biden did it was he made it seem like it was organic — and understand it was choreographed all the way,"" Jordan added. The chairman further noted the 51 officials' names on the joint letter were accompanied by their current or former titles, giving the document the ""imprimatur"" of accuracy. ""That's the scariest thing of all,"" he said. ""And that letter became the basis for keeping this information from the American people.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was blasted on social media for calling Florida’s education law ""dystopian,"" claiming gay teachers cannot show pictures of their spouses anymore.

Critics blast Dem Rep. Stacey Plaskett for threatening journalist Matt Taibbi with jail time: 'Party of norms',"Journalist Matt Taibbi, who collaborated on the Twitter Files, sounds off on 'The Story.' Top House Democrat Stacey Plaskett, V.I., is facing intense backlash for threatening jail time towards independent journalist Matt Taibbi over his testimony about the Twitter Files at last month's Congressional hearing. ""Sure is getting fashy around here,"" reacted fellow Twitter Files journalist Michael Shellenberger, who testified alongside Taibbi at the hearing. Shellenberger later added, ""It is an honor to be invited to be an expert witness. Not only are we unpaid, we pay our own travel. What @StaceyPlaskett has done is a disgrace. Why would anyone choose to testify if they’re going to threatened with prison? Talk about a grotesque attack on norms. For shame."" Del. Stacey Plaskett, D-V.I., the ranking member of the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, sent a letter to Taibbi regarding a comment he told lawmakers, which she alleged included an error that was previously propped up by MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan in a tense interview exchange regarding the name of one of the federal agencies swept up in the Twitter Files. JOURNALIST MATT TAIBBI THREATENED WITH PRISON TIME FOR PERJURY BY TOP DEMOCRAT OVER TWITER FILES TESTIMONY The error was a specific reference to CISA, the government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, when he meant to refer to CIS, the Center for Internet Security, which is a private organization.

Rep. Plaskett's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. In the letter sent to Taibbi, Plaskett cited his alleged erroneous statement, saying it is ""contradicted by your own admission."" ""This mistake is important because, by adding an ‘A,' you weren't making a harmless spelling error. Rather, you were alleging that CISA — a government entity — was working with the EIP [Election Integrity Partnership] to have posts removed from social media,"" Plaskett wrote to Taibbi, according to a letter obtained by journalist and fellow Twitter Files reporter Lee Fang on Thursday. ""When presented with this misinformation, you acknowledged you had made ‘an error’ by intentionally altering the acronym CIS and you subsequently deleted your erroneous tweet."" Plaskett continued, ""Prior to your appearance before the subcommittee on March 9, you signed the Judiciary Committee's Truth in Testimony form, certifying that you understand that ‘knowingly providing material false information to this committee/subcommittee or knowingly concealing material information from this committee/subcommittee, is a crime (18 U.S.C. 1001). In addition, at the beginning of the March 9 hearing, you swore ‘under penalty of perjury that the testimony you [were] about to give [was] true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief.'

The IRS allegedly showed up at Taibbi's home on the same day he gave his testimony to Congress about his findings from the Twitter Files. (Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage) But as Fang noted in his reporting, the specific comments Taibbi told Congress that Plaskett cited ""were correct"" despite the original error in his Twitter Files reporting. Plaskett, a non-voting Democratic delegate from the Virgin Islands, had a contentious exchange with Taibbi at last month's hearing, referring to him as a ""so-called journalist"" and grilled him to reveal his source for his Twitter Files reporting, who she suspected was Twitter owner Elon Musk.

Fellow guests and audience members did not take it well. A 5th grade teacher locked horns with fellow guests and audience members during Dr. Phil amid a heated debate about whether schools should teach transgender ideology. Dr. Phil hosted an episode on Thursday over gender ""inclusivity"" in schools, ranging from tampons being given out in boys’ restrooms to curriculum teaching transgender ideology. One guest argued that tampons being given out in boys’ restrooms would be a massive help to those who don’t have their own money. A 5th grade teacher however, replied with basic biological fact. ""Men do not menstruate. Only women menstruate,"" the teacher named Ray declared. A transgender activist named Jordan replied, ""Cis-men don’t menstruate, but trans men do menstruate, same as non-binary people,"" later adding, ""menstruating is not exclusive to women."" DESANTIS RELEASES GRAPHIC VIDEO SHOWING TRANS SURGERIES AFTER BIDEN CALLS GOVERNOR’S POLICIES ‘CRUEL’ A 5th grade teacher shredded transgender ideology during an episode of Dr. Phil. Ray cited biology about how being a male or female is designated by their chromosomes and argued women cannot become men. ""They’re not men… they’re women dressed as men. You are not a man. You can pretend to be a man, and that’s ok. That’s perfectly fine. Live your life,"" he said. Later in the episode, after Ray objected to being interrupted, saying that it is rude to do so, an audience member claimed that he himself was rude by denying people’s gender identity. ""I’d like to understand from your perspective why you don’t believe it’s rude and why you think you have a right to - when someone identifies a certain way - for you to tell them that that is not correct that particular gender or identity?"" the audience member asked. ""Why do I feel that it’s right to tell them the truth?"" Ray responded. ""But it’s not the truth,"" Jordan interjected. ""The people who hate the truth"" object to it ""because they see the truth as hateful,"" he responded. ""If you want to identify in any way you can, you’re free to do so. But that does not mean that the rest of us have to join that illusion."" TRANSGENDER PASTOR COMPARES TREATMENT OF 'MARGINALIZED' NASHVILLE SHOOTER TO JESUS BEING CRUCIFIED A visibly upset member of the audience asked, ""If a transgender person is not harming you or the people you love, why do you care so much?"" ""Because you want us to care,"" Ray answered. ""No, I don’t want you to care, I want you to be quiet,"" she said. ""I want you to stop being hateful."" ""I disagree with you, and so you call it’ hate,’"" Ray replied. ""But there’s no hate in my heart at all.""

Former Navy pilot who's seen UFOs asks Biden to investigate: Anything from foreign tech to 'space aliens',"Ryan Graves, a former Navy fighter pilot, is calling on Biden to lead the investigation into unidentified aerial phenomenon or risk American national security. Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves said that if the Biden administration does not investigate UFOs in American airspace, then the U.S. risks being outmaneuvered by a foreign power. Graves, who has testified that he has witnessed unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) during his career as a fighter pilot, was responding to a congressional hearing from Wednesday. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, who is director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) under the Pentagon, warned Congress about the dangers of UAPs during his testimony. Graves broke down Dr. Kirkpatrick's testimony during an interview with Fox News Digital. The former fighter pilot told Fox News Digital that President Biden has a responsibility to tell the American people honestly what is happening in the skies above their heads. Ryan Graves noted that there was a ""friction"" between government agencies that need to be removed if the U.S. wants to respond to the possible threat of UAPs. EX-NAVY PILOT WHO'S SEEN UFOS IN FLIGHT CALLS FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF AERIAL PHENOMENA: 'WE NEED TO BE CURIOUS' ""I think Biden holds the hammer on communication on this topic. I think that from the executive branch, they need to ensure the American people that they serve have the communication flow and the comfort and the leadership in the Department of Defense and the organization is now set up to do that."" Graves noted that there was a ""friction"" between government agencies that need to be removed if the U.S. is able to respond to the possible threat of UAPs. ""I believe that if the Biden administration, the interagency task force that they set up can help bring those different agencies together, then it's going to be the Biden administration's responsibility to communicate the results of that investigation,"" he said. ""In the past,"" Graves explained, ""the description and the shape of the objects was classified. In this hearing, we learned that about 50% of the objects are spherical in description. And then there's a plethora of other descriptions of smaller probabilities that they discussed. They also showed that the objects were essentially operating in all the U.S. operational areas."" Graves continued, ""That includes the East and West Coast as well as over the ""actual continental United States."" Former Navy fighter pilot Ryan Graves speaks to reporters after a House Intelligence subcommittee hearing on UFOs, officially called unidentified aerial phenomena, on May 17, 2022. (Tyler Olson/Fox News) UAPs have been spotted in ""operational areas off of Japan and in the Middle East as well,"" he added. Some of these UAPs, Graves explained, were at altitudes ""right smack dab in the center of our airspace,"" also making them a ""serious aviation safety issue."" ""The primary shape of these objects is spherical,"" Graves said, adding that Dr. Kirkpatrick described some of the spheres as ""clear,"" ""opaque"" or even ""translucent."" The UAP expert even mentioned ""emissions in the radio frequency band"" from the UAPs as well as ""frequency ranges that were associated with the detection capabilities,"" according to Graves. Graves agreed with Dr. Kirkpatrick’s assessment that the Department of Defense should implement procedures for UAPs into their operations and ""normalize"" the discussion of UFOs. The possibilities for these flying objects could be anything from a foreign technology ""all the way to space aliens,"" as Graves said, summarizing Dr. Kirkpatrick's testimony. FORMER FIGHTER PILOT SAYS UFOS MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE THINK: 'WE WERE SEEING THEM ON OUR RADARS’ UFO seen in clip released by Department of Defense. A Pentagon watchdog is launching a probe into the actions taken by the Department of Defense after a series of UFO sightings in recent years. (Department of Defense) ""But right now,"" he added, ""I don't know if there's enough collaboration and cooperation between the individual branches and organizations"" for people like Dr. Kirkpatrick to be able to investigate the UAPs. Graves said that the American public has shifted to a ""sense of urgency"" about the potential national security threats of UAPs. The views of the public on UAP have also been affected by media coverage, which in the U.S., Graves said, ""has matured quite a bit compared to the rest of the world."" That is because people take UAPs ""much more seriously than before,"" Graves said. ""We've seen how this can be a very realistic national security issue if we just laugh off these unidentified aircraft."" Those national security threats could potentially be catastrophic, he added. ""I'm almost hesitant to make this comparison,"" Graves said, pausing slightly, ""but we've seen what massive intelligence failures can lead to. We lived through 9/11 and we've seen the repercussions of different intelligence agencies not communicating what they know individually to put that full picture together."" Looking from the outside, Graves said, the American government is still divided, without ""organization or at least the willpower"" to the various ""puzzle"" pieces on UAPs and create a full intelligence picture. FORMER NAVY PILOT TESTIFIES THAT HE WITNESSED UFOS WITH HIS ‘OWN EYES', CALLS ON BIDEN TO INVESTIGATE Graves emphasized that while he certainly could not predict a catastrophe on the level of 9/11, it was still important for national security to learn as much as possible about UAPs. It’s a problem, he said, that America has ""solved in the past."" ""Let's solve it again, so we don't get to potentially something catastrophic, not necessarily with UFOs or aliens, but some foreign adversary could take advantage of that gap in our domain awareness for bad purposes."" Elon Musk discusses the dangers of AI in an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson. (Fox News) Graves also responded directly to comments that Twitter CEO Elon Musk made that he has ""seen no evidence of aliens."" ""My general sentiment is that Elon is jumping right to conclusions, much as I caution against for those that say ‘they are aliens.'"" That's because the evidence is not decisive in one direction or another on the alien question, Graves said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We're in a data gathering phase, not a conclusions phase. What we do have are anomalous sightings, confirmed by DoD. As we heard from the Pentagon's UAP expert, Dr. Kirkpatrick, we simply don't have the data to conclude at this time. Does Mr. Musk have such data?"" Gates asked. Graves added that his organization, Americans for Safe Aerospace, will continue to raise awareness on UAPs and educate ""Capitol Hill and policymakers more on this issue.""

From fake Drake to AI-generated Eminem tracks: Can musicians copyright style?,"An AI art lecturer says an AI-generated song seemingly created in the style of musician Drake raises copyright questions surrounding an artist's style.

He was the most charming man you could ever find."" However, the former owner of RKO Studios had a dark side. Howard Hughes was a notorious Hollywood Playboy who was romantically linked to numerous leading ladies including Ava Gardner (pictured here). (Hulton Archive/Getty Images) ""He was also a liar,"" Moore explained. ""And he did unthinkable things. He did so many things that hurt me. Was he cruel? I guess you could say he was cruel, but I didn’t know that he was cruel. He was just too much for me to handle. I was too naive."" ""I think he paid for it in the end,"" Moore shared. ""He had a terrible death. He could manipulate so much. I was too young and too innocent."" According to the outlet, Hughes spent his final years living from hotel to hotel.

""He wanted to teach me, which he did. He arranged for me to jump with the 82nd Airborne [Division], which I did. And I just loved that. Flying with Howard was magical, especially at night when we'd see all the stars above us and all the lights below us. I mean, it was just so thrilling, and he was thrilled with it too."" ""He said, ‘When you're in the air you [get to] see which things are small and which things are big,’"" she continued. ""And people forget, Howard was a great hero too. Maybe I love heroes because he was the first man to ever fly around the world. They talk so much about [Charles] Lindbergh, but he only flew the Atlantic. Howard flew around the world."" ""In the beginning, I had no feelings for him,"" Moore shared. ""But as time went on, I fell madly in love with him. In fact, Howard was the love of my life.

Russell Crowe almost quit 'Gladiator' because the script was 'absolute rubbish',"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Can you imagine the iconic drama ""Gladiator"" without Russell Crowe? It was in the realm of possibility, according to Crowe himself, who admitted he almost left the project for a multitude of reasons. ""‘Gladiator's' my 20-something movie. I was confident about my abilities as a leading man. What I wasn’t confident about with ‘Gladiator’ was the world that was surrounding me,"" he told Vanity Fair. ""At the core of what we were doing was a great concept, but the script, it was rubbish. Absolute rubbish. And it had all these sort of strange sequences, you know. One of them, was about chariots,"" he shared. While all the storylines were factual, Crowe worried that nothing would resonate with viewers. ""It's just not gonna ring right to a modern audience. They're gonna go, ‘What the f--- is all this?’"" Russel Crowe played Maximus in the 1999 film ""Gladiator."" (Universal) ‘GLADIATOR’ STAR RUSSELL CROWE REVEALS HE'S 'JEALOUS' OVER SEQUEL ""The energy around what we were doing was very fractured,"" he said of the film set. ""I did think a couple of times, ‘Maybe my best option is just to get on a plane and get out of here.'"" Conversations Crowe had with the film's director, Ridley Scott, contributed to the actor's decision to stay. Crowe recalled Scott telling him, ""Mate, we're not committing anything to camera that you don't believe in 100%."" ""When we actually started that film, we had 21 pages of script that we agreed on,"" Crowe shared. ""So we had a long way to go, and you know we basically used up those pages in the first section of the movie, so by the time we got to our second location, which was Morocco, we were sort of catching up."" Russell Crowe shared that he believed the original script for ""Gladiator"" was ""absolute rubbish."" (Universal) Although Crowe was in his mid-30s and relatively established at the time of filming, he resonated with co-star Joaquin Phoenix, who was just 26. ""Joaquin was going through the same thing that I was,"" Crowe recalled. ""When you walk onto a set that big, it's very easy for imposter-syndrome to come over you. It's like ‘What am I gonna do with this?’ And we'd go to his costume appointments and they'd put him in this armor and all this finery, you know. I remember one day he said to Ridley, ‘Ridley, I don’t understand. You know, I'm a kid from Florida, what am I supposed to do in this? Go out and wave to people?' And Ridley's like ‘Yeah. That’s what you're supposed to do.'"" Joaquin Phoenix played Commodus in ""Gladiator."" He was in his mid-20s when they filmed the movie. (Universal) CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Phoenix is now a critically acclaimed actor, but at the time, Crowe says only Scott knew of his talent. ""We all know this now. We know how fine an actor he is now. But back then, it was only Ridley Scott who knew how fine an actor he was. He was the one convincing Joaquin to do this, and to do it the way he did it, you know. The subtleties and the menace, and all of these things he brought to that role,"" he shared of his co-star. ""When I first saw it, I was blown away by it. When I first saw it with a crowd, that's when it really freaked me out because it was like going to a movie when I was a kid. People were so connected to the film, and they were voicing that connection."" Russell Crowe praised Joaquin Phoenix for his acting skills in the film. (Lucy Nicholson/AFP) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Crowe admitted that despite all the success he has received from the film, he is actually somewhat embarrassed by it. ""It's an incredible ensemble cast, with beautiful performances from end to end, not only Joaquin, but Connie Nielson, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Tomas Arana, Djimon Hounsou, I mean come on, man. It's just beautiful stuff,"" he said. ""I wish that every young actor could have a something like a ‘Gladiator' in their career. We made that film in 1999, and I'll bet you money somewhere in the world tonight, that film is playing on primetime television. It has the longest legs and people, you know they're not just connected to it, but they love it with a passion."" Caroline Thayer is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

Bam claimed that producers were not compensating him and attempted to steal the ""lucrative franchise"" without his approval. Margera allegedly signed a contract with Paramount that stipulated a ""wellness agreement,"" something Bam claimed he had been ""coerced"" into signing while he was in rehab recovering from addiction struggles in 2019.

""Rather, Margera, who has a documented history of physical and mental health issues, including diagnosed bipolar disorder, has been the victim of unconscionable discrimination at the hands of Defendants."" In 2018, Margera was arrested and charged with DUI and headed to rehab. He appeared on ""Dr. Phil"" in 2019 and checked back into rehab soon after. The lawsuit claims the named parties fired Margera after he tested positive for the prescribed substance despite his position that he had been taking Adderall by prescription for 10 years.

""Margera was made to endure psychological torture in the form of a sham Wellness Agreement, and then ultimately terminated for his protected class status due to his medical condition, and his complaints about Defendants’ discriminatory conduct towards him."" In a press release announcing the filing of the lawsuit, Margera said, ""I am pissed-off, angry, hurt and shattered that Johnny [Knoxville], Jeff [Tremaine], Spike [Jonze] and the studios and producers ripped off my creativity, content, and stunts to make this movie, fired me without justification, and refuse to pay for my work; I created this franchise before any of these guys ever got involved."" He continued, ""My lawsuit isn’t just about compensation. It’s about treating people with mental health and addiction issues in an honest manner and not taking advantage of their disabilities to rip them off."" Tremaine filed a restraining order against Bam shortly after for ""civil harassment prevention."" By April 2022, Bam filed for the lawsuit to be ""dismissed with prejudice"" in a Los Angeles Superior Court. He cannot file the suit again.

U2 creates new immersive concert experience at Las Vegas venue,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. U2 is familiar with rocking out in major sporting arenas and stadiums, but the legendary band will soon hit the stage to create a new immersive concert experience inside a high-tech, globe-shaped venue in Las Vegas. Live Nation and Sphere Entertainment announced Monday the dates for U2’s upcoming ""U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At Sphere"" shows starting Sept. 29. The rock band’s special five-night run of shows will be held until Oct. 8 at The Venetian’s Sphere with a state-of-the-art audio and visual system designed for each concertgoer. ""This is a venue designed for entertainment, not sports,"" said U2 guitarist The Edge in a recent interview. He first learned about the cutting-edge venue after lead singer Bono sent him a link about the concept. He said the screen is 20 times bigger than the one during the band’s Joshua Tree tour in 2019 — the last time U2 performed live in a concert setting. JAMIE FOXX IS 'HEALING' AFTER SUFFERING 'MEDICAL COMPLICATION': REPORT ""Sports is a simple formula. You want to see the action,"" he continued. ""But no one really sits down when they’re designing one of these sports arenas and thinks about sound. That’s way, way down on their list of priorities. But in this venue, it’s one of the first things they thought about."" The massive spherical venue will have 17,500 seats with a scalable capacity of nearly 20,000 guests. Along with high resolution LED screens that wrap halfway around the audience, the venue is also equipped with thousands of speakers that will deliver a ""crystal-clear"" multi-layered audio system for every seat inside. U2 perform during a concert at the Apollo Theater on June 11, 2018, in New York. ""U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At Sphere"" will be held at The Venetian’s MSG Sphere. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) As a musician, The Edge said the venue’s concept is an ""amazing thought"" in helping performers like U2 capture the full essence of their sound. He said their shows will offer an opportunity to ""literally transport people to some other space and time"" and open a variety of ""creative possibilities."" ""What we’re able to do — because of the design and the fidelity of the sound — is introduce not just the best sounding rock ‘n’ roll band of all time in an indoor venue,"" he said. ""But also, radical intimacy where you can actually deliver a vocal or a simple music arrangement that’s really delicate. The people will be able to hear perfectly. Whereas if you’re trying that in an arena or a stadium, it would just be impossible."" WHY IS MORGAN WALLEN SO FAMOUS? A LOOK AT HOW THE COUNTRY STAR GOT HIS START ON ‘THE VOICE’ During the band’s rehearsals, The Edge has already seen a significant difference from the sphere venue compared to an arena or stadium — which normally ""imposes on your sound."" He said their music preparations haven’t changed much, but they are starting to try to understand how to use the immersive sound as a creative tool. The Edge believes the band’s performances at Sphere could be a ""quantum leap forward"" in terms of the sensory impacts of a live concert. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""It’s technology that has never been available,"" he said. ""We can literally in sonic terms, but also in visual terms, have our audience not kind of be looking at the show, but be in the middle of the show and in the middle of the sound. It’s sound all around you. … I’m already starting to think about the mixes and our songs and think about how this spatial audio could come into its own in terms of just where we place different parts of our sound."" The Edge said U2 is pumped to return to the stage for the first time in four years, especially after the pandemic. The band’s upcoming show will mark the first time performing without drummer Larry Mullen Jr., who is recovery from back surgery. In Mullen's absence, Bram van den Berg will fill in as drummer. ""We’re so excited,"" he said. ""We’ve been on lockdown. I’ve been in the recording studio for the last 18 months doing the acoustic collection, ‘Songs of Surrender.’ I can’t wait to get out there and be a part of something huge like this.""

On April 21, the streaming platform will premiere ""His Majesty’s Coronation: Behind the Throne,"" a special featuring a panel of royal experts and insiders who will dig deep into the traditions associated with the coronation. The king will be crowned on May 6 at London’s Westminster Abbey. According to Bullen, sources told him that ""everyone is really pleased that Harry’s coming to the coronation."" KING CHARLES MAKES SURPRISING GESTURE TOWARD MEGHAN MARKLE IN OFFICIAL CORONATION PROGRAM True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen told Fox News Digital that despite tensions, the British royal family is pleased that Prince Harry will attend his father's coronation in May. (Victoria Jones - WPA Pool/Getty Images) ""He had to come,"" Bullen explained. ""This is his father’s biggest moment. It’s what his father waited his whole life for. It would’ve been just rude not to turn up, let alone lacking in dignity and style… The royal family, the household, the nation – [everyone] is really pleased he’s coming. He had to be a part of it."" The date of the coronation coincides with Archie’s birthday, giving the former American actress an excuse to stay behind in the States. Bullen said that following the six-part Netflix docuseries detailing the couple’s decision to quit royal duties, the 41-year-old made the right decision to skip the celebrations. Harry and the former ""Suits"" star, who is biracial, have alleged she faced racist attitudes from both the palace and the U.K. press. The treatment contributed to their decision to leave the country. Meghan Markle, an American actress, became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Prince Harry in 2018. (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) The revelations in ""Spare″ include details of private conversations between Harry and his father, as well as with his brother Prince William. The bestselling book fanned tensions between Harry and his family that became public when he and his wife moved to North America in 2020. The book also included allegations that members of the royal family regularly feed the press unflattering information about other members of the House of Windsor in exchange for positive coverage of themselves. Following the publication of ""Spare,"" the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed that they were asked to vacate their home in Britain. Frogmore Cottage, a royal residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle, was the couple’s main residence before they gave up royal duties and moved to the wealthy, coastal city of Montecito. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently confirmed that they were asked to vacate their U.K. home. According to reports, King Charles launched the eviction process a day after Prince Harry's explosive memoir ""Spare"" was published. (Matt Dunham - WPA Pool/Getty Images) Bullen said Markle’s appearance would have only fueled the ongoing royal soap opera. ""It’s definitely better that Harry’s flying solo because it avoids any awkward moments with family members,"" Bullen explained. ""It’s going to be tough enough. I don’t think [Prince] William and Harry will have any meaningful conversations. Harry’s made it pretty clear he intends to fly in and fly out and wants to be back that day for Archie’s birthday. So the opportunities for them to speak to each other will be very minimal. I don’t think Harry’s part of the procession. He’s unlikely to be on the balcony, so there’s going to be very little interaction. They’ll travel in different vehicles. So there are not many moments where they need to come together."" Prince William's relationship with his younger brother Prince Harry continues to be at an all-time low, Nick Bullen claimed. (Karwai Tang/WireImage) ""But I think Meghan not coming makes it easier for everybody because it doesn’t become ‘The Meghan Show,’"" Bullen continued. ""And even if Meghan didn’t want it to be ‘The Meghan Show,’ she’s bright enough to realize that if she turns up, cameras will be trained on her to see how she’s reacting. Cameras will be trained on Kate [Middleton] to see how she’s looking at Meghan. How does Queen [Camilla] look at Meghan? Do the king and Meghan have any conversations? It all becomes about what happened with Meghan. So I think it’s a good thing she’s not coming.""

He said that if ""Meghan had been in the room, it would’ve been more difficult for everybody."" Royal watchers would have focused on how Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle interacted with each other during the coronation. (Richard Pohle - WPA Pool/Getty Images) Still, he said, there’s a sense of ""sadness"" that the Duchess of Sussex won’t be there to support her father-in-law. It was Charles, he pointed out, who walked Markle down the aisle on her wedding day in 2018 when her father, former Hollywood lighting director Thomas Markle, couldn’t attend. ""If you look back to Harry and Meghan’s wedding, there was so much goodwill for them,"" said Bullen. ""There was so much that they could have done for the monarchy. This would’ve been another moment that allowed us to see how good they could have been. I think it’s sad for everybody – for them, for the family, for the nation, for the Commonwealth. It’s sad that opportunity has been lost, and it will never be regained.""

(Jonathan Brady/Pool/AFP/Getty Images) ""I think there will be a sadness on everybody’s part, but at the same time, there’ll be relief that the story isn’t about her,"" Bullen continued. ""… Lots of people hold her, and Harry, responsible for this family breakdown. They’ve taken a position that has been very difficult for them to come back from. And it’s been very difficult for the Windsors to step into. I know for a fact that the king and Harry have spoken. And I know for a fact that the king has done whatever he can to try and facilitate the rebuilding of a relationship. But the Sussexes have made their bed, and they’re lying in it very clearly."" Bullen continues to be hopeful that in time, Harry will mend his relationship with the king. Sources told him that the 74-year-old and his younger son, 38, have had positive conversations. And while the king was said to be deeply hurt by Harry’s claims in his memoir, he’s ""pleased"" that the prince will attend the coronation, even if the visit is brief. And Markle, suspecting the kind of backlash she may receive by the British press for her appearance, thought better of it. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made their royal exit in 2020. (Samir Hussein/WireImage) There is plenty of hurt to go around, said Bullen. However, the ongoing saga won’t end when the king is crowned. ""For years, we’ve been obsessed with big, powerful families,"" Bullen explained. ""Whether it’s ‘Dallas,’ ‘Dynasty,’ ‘Succession,’ ‘Yellowstone’ – all those great shows have successful, powerful families at the heart of them. And this is what this is… And it’s real life. It’s better than anything you’re going to get in fiction."" The Associated Press contributed to this report. Stephanie Nolasco covers entertainment at Foxnews.com. ",1510,entertainment
Granger Smith feels 'relief' leaving country music to 'serve' God: 'I need to completely surrender',"The ""Happens Like That"" singer has written a new memoir being published this summer titled ""Like a River: Finding the Faith and Strength to Move Forward after Loss and Heartache."" Granger Smith is walking away from his successful country music career – and he's relieved. Earlier this month, the singer/songwriter took to his social media pages and announced that his upcoming ""Like a River"" tour, named after his son, would be his last. The 43-year-old is gearing up to devote his life to ministry at his local church outside of Austin, Texas. His final show is on Aug. 26. ""I have a huge feeling of relief now that … I’ve been able to tell the world exactly what my intentions are and what I’m going to do,"" the ""Happens Like That"" artist told Fox News Digital. ""For the last few years, a handful of people had known that [I was] probably leaving country music. [And] it’s difficult to get on stage in different environments, in different cities and play music for people knowing, as I’m looking into their eyes, that I’m probably going to tell them in a few months that I’m not doing this anymore. That’s a difficult way to live. And so, there’s a big sense of relief now that I’ve told everyone."" Granger Smith's tour comes to an end on Aug. 26. (Randy Holmes/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images) The star admitted that for a while, he yearned for a new sense of purpose. Eager to devote himself to his faith, Smith is currently working toward a master’s degree from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. While some in Smith’s circle encouraged him to share his faith through song, Smith felt it wasn’t enough. ""I wrestled with the idea for a long time that this doesn’t feel right,"" Smith admitted. ""A lot of people will probably think, ‘Why don’t you just sing country music, but talk about God on the stage?’ Or, ‘Why don’t you sing a couple of hymns on the stage? And that fixes everything.’ I wrestled with that for a couple of years.… A lot of pastors and preachers told me, ‘Country music is your ministry, brother. You’re in a dark world. You’re bringing light to a dark world. You’re going into bars and stages where people might not have heard the message of Christ, and you get to speak it – that is your ministry.’"" ""I believed it,"" he continued. ""And part of me still does believe that. But here’s the deal – it wasn’t ever about that. It wasn’t ever about finding the best platform to tell people about Christ. The first thing that needed to happen was I needed to make myself smaller because I was exalting myself on the stage. I was glorifying myself. I was seeking praise from people. And by doing that, it doesn’t matter if I was proclaiming Christ, because I was doing it the wrong way. I was proclaiming Christ from a self-exalting platform. And that was the contradiction I finally had to come to terms with. I might have a stage down the road, but right now I need to completely surrender that and give it over to God."" COUNTRY MUSIC STAR GRANGER SMITH LEAVING INDUSTRY FOR MINISTRY: 'I JUST WANT TO GLORIFY GOD' After touring, Granger Smith is going to focus on ministry at his local church outside of Austin, Texas. (Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Stagecoach) Smith said he’s eager to be an active member of his church, one that would allow him to give back to his local community and connect with those who are feeling lost in their lives. It’s a feeling he can easily identify with. Granger Smith's son River passed away in 2019 from a drowning accident at the family's Texas home. (Granger Smith) In 2019, Smith fell into a downward spiral when he lost his three-year-old child. The Smith family was outside their home when River slipped through their pool gate and went into the water. River was quickly pulled out of the pool, but he had been without oxygen for too long. Despite the efforts of doctors, he later died. River’s eldest siblings, Lincoln and London, witnessed the devastating accident.

There were days, he said, when he struggled to get up in the morning. ""Most of it was failure,"" he said. ""Trying to figure out how I was going to wake up in the morning and start a new day, knowing I have a dead son, is something that I failed at for months and months.… I tried everything. I tried the self-help books and I tried different forms of exercise, diets. Different edibles – anything. If you would’ve said, ‘Are you going through heartache? Are you going through extreme grief? Try this. I read about this, try it,’ I’d probably try it.… I was going to do anything so that I could be strong for my family. Nothing was working."" Granger Smith's son Lincoln is seen here visiting River's grave.

The family shared it was important that Maverick receive formal swimming safety lessons. Smith said that immersing himself in his faith gave him a lifeline. ""Let’s look at it this way – when you have a 3- or 4-year-old child, they might be going through something really tough, like trying to tie their shoes,"" he explained. ""They’re getting frustrated… they’re hungry… They’re just going through this tough time of just tying their shoes and everything is going wrong. Then a parent comes in, picks them up, and says, ‘Stop fighting. I got you. I’ll get your shoes tied. I’ll get you to school. Just stop fighting.’ It’s that same feeling I had when I finally released myself and said, ‘God, I’m giving this all to you. Just take it.’ And then that fatherly feeling of Him just wrapping his arms around me and going, ‘I got you.’ That’s the feeling of relief that I had."" The Smith family, from left, Amber, Maverick, London, Lincoln and Granger. (Granger Smith) While devoting a life to ministry isn’t the right path for everyone, Smith said he is at peace with his decision. He won’t miss sleeping on tour buses, he joked, but he’ll never forget the outpouring of support that has come from fans over the years. ""There’s a lot I’m going to miss in country music,"" he said. ""I’ve been doing it for a long time, for multiple decades, for a reason. It wasn’t because I was collecting a paycheck, because most of those years I wasn’t. I do it – and I did it – because I loved telling stories through songs that people could relate to.… That’s what I loved most about it – seeing those reactions from people as we took them on a journey.""

Carol Burnett reveals what she misses about comedy: ‘I don’t think a network would take a chance’,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Carol Burnett is so glad we had this time together. The legendary comedienne, who is turning the big 9-0 on April 26, is offering more time and tunes with the help of her celebrity pals.

(Photo by Steve Granitz/FilmMagic) ""What I love about it was the fact that it wasn’t a roast, and it wasn’t a birthday party with a cake and balloons and stuff,"" Burnett chuckled to Fox News Digital. ""It was a two-hour variety show. We had a 19-piece orchestra and I had so many friends who were there. And the live entertainment, my gosh… It was really exciting."" ""It was just a party – everybody had a good time,"" she added. The actress had her first breakout role on Broadway at age 26 in 1959, singing in the musical fairytale spoof, ""Once Upon a Mattress.""

When reflecting on today’s comedy, she admitted she misses the classics, noting ""I’d like to see variety come back."" ""But [the networks] could never do what we did because I think the cost would be extravagant now,"" she explained. ""We had a 28-piece orchestra, 12 dancers. We had 60 to 75 costumes a week. Bob Mackie designed for our guest stars. All of that you couldn’t do today. It would be too much. We did kind of a Broadway mini-musical comedy review every week. And that couldn’t be done today. But there could be a hybrid of some way to do a variety show because there are people who could certainly do variety. But I don’t think a network would take a chance. I just wish they would.""

Looking back at her career, Burnett said she was initially discouraged from doing comedy her way. She was told by one of the vice presidents at CBS that variety was ""a man’s game"" reserved for stars like Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason and Dean Martin. There was no room for her, he stressed. She did not listen. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER After Carol Burnett left ""The Garry Moore Show"" in 1962, she signed a 10-year contract with CBS.

[But] they poo-pooed my idea, saying, ‘No, you can’t do that.’ And [they] had a sitcom they wanted me to do, to which I said, ‘I don’t want to be the same person every week. I want variety, I want music, I want different characters to do.’ They had to put us on the air because I had a 10-year contract… I just said, ‘This is what I know, and this is what I want to do.’ I wasn’t deterred at all. I just simply said, ‘I want to have fun.’ And I pushed for that. They had to put it on the air."" Carol Burnett was initially discouraged from launching a variety show.

The women developed a close friendship, one that lasted until the ""I Love Lucy"" star’s death in 1989 at age 77. ""She never tried to give me any advice,"" Burnett said.

""When we read the sketch, the writers had written that I would run up the stairs and then come back down with the draperies just hanging on me,"" Burnett explained. ""Bob Mackie, who’s so brilliant, thought, ‘Well, that’s not as funny as it could be.’ I went into the costume fitting that week, and he said, ‘I have an idea for the curtain dress.’ I walked into the fitting room, and he had it on this mannequin.

I knew it was going to get a crazy, wonderful response. I remember being right at the top of the stairs. And when I entered, it was like a cannon went off in the studio. The audience – everybody – was just hysterical. But I wasn’t surprised. I expected it. I knew it would be a hit. And it was all Bob’s thinking. He’s a genius. He designed 60 to 70 costumes a week on our show, not just what I wore, but what everybody wore – all the sketches. He designed the looks for everybody.""

Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET. Though Thomas Alva Edison’s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don’t realize that Edison almost wasn’t the world’s greatest inventor. A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers. At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as ""a dunce."" But his mother saw something else in her Al. GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE While creating my new ""Turnabout Tales"" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison’s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself.  I believe each of us has a ""Turnabout Tale,"" whether in our past or in the future. Raymond Arroyo (Courtesy Raymond Arroyo) Edison’s ""Turnabout"" really began at age eight.  Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle’s schoolhouse in 1855.   The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al.  He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD.  Edison said of this period: ""The teachers did not sympathize with me and…my father thought I was stupid.""  His teacher did as well. One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was ""addled"" and ""unable to be taught."" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself.  Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison’s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor. Thomas Edison (Associated Press) Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al’s daring, hands on experimentation. Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor’s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom’s pursuits. I don’t know why Thomas Edison isn’t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life: ""My mother was the making of me…she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor."" Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo is the author of ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" (Fox News) It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing. ""Deafness probably drove me to reading."" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone. But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life. Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands. Surrounded by books, at his ""Invention Factory"" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation. Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe.  The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car—all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught. At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison’s must be preserved and spread.  History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future. Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother.  If it hadn’t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems. I hope this first ""Turnabout Tale: helps us all to see the possibility in every young life and to recognize the responsibility we as adults have to nurture the light within them.

"Black history through the years: Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Former Olympian John Carlos and former NFL player Jack Brewer join Harris Faulkner on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia. Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture. Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today. BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today. Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years. Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports. Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court. BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner. Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance. Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850). Portrait of Frederick Douglass, who was born into slavery in 1818. (iStock) Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland. He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress. Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881). BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment. Harriet Tubman, American abolitionist leader (1820-1913), escaped slavery by marrying a free man and led many other slaves to safety through the use of the abolitionist network known as the Underground Railroad.    (MPI/Getty Images) Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross. She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished. Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more."" Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS. By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid. Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri. While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865. Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree. YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college. American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation. Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports. Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage. Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900). Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931. American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports. He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke. Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth."" Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism."" Thurgood Marshall, the great-grandson of a slave, was the first Black member of the United States Supreme Court. (Getty Images) Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore. He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports. From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights. THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal."" Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases. His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991. Rosa Parks, civil rights activist, was born in 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. (Getty Images) Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports. At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow. The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time. The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute. She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991. Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill. In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U.S. House of Representatives reports. Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director and educational consultant before entering politics. Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Getty Images) Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws. He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality. King delivered his most famous speech, ""I Have a Dream,"" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance. However, it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photos and video.

The general manager is now dealt with the task of building the franchise back up after suffering their first losing season since 2018 and three straight NFC North titles from 2019 to 2021. Not to mention, Green Bay dealt Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders before last season and went from 10th in points scored and yards gained to 14th in points scored and 17th in yards gained.

Aaron Rodgers isn't just changing teams — he's reportedly changing his number, too. Rodgers is finally heading to the New York Jets after they reached a common ground with the Green Bay Packers on Monday. But if there was an issue among Jets fans about the four-time MVP quarterback joining the team, it was his No. 12 that he's been wearing with the Packers since he broke into the league in 2005. No. 12 is an immortal number in Jets history, as ""Broadway"" Joe Namath wore it during his Hall of Fame career. However, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports that Namath actually gave Rodgers his blessing to don No. 12 in a Jets uniform if he so chooses.

Rodgers will reportedly wear No. 8 with the Jets, which is the number he wore with the California Bears during his time at the university. AARON RODGERS FINALLY JOINS JETS IN TRADE WITH PACKERS, ENDS 18-YEAR RUN IN GREEN BAY With wide receiver Elijah Moore being traded to the Cleveland Browns, No. 8 is very much available in Florham Park for Rodgers to have. Rodgers spent just two years at Cal, but did well with 5,469 yards and 43 touchdowns to 13 interceptions total over 25 games. The Packers ended up taking him 24th overall in the 2005 NFL Draft to study under Brett Favre. He did so for three seasons before taking over in 2008 full-time after Favre went, you guessed it, to the Jets. Talk about a full circle moment. Jets fans have been clamoring for this deal to get done, and it finally does as talks restarted between both sides on Monday. Reports stated that things stalled after common ground couldn't be found, but Jets GM Joe Douglas finally agreed to the terms set by Packers GM Brian Gutekunst.

For the last 12 years, the Jets have not made it to the playoffs, which is the longest streak in professional sports, let alone the NFL. This comes after the Sacramento Kings made the playoffs in the NBA this season. Rodgers has the offensive weapons to make things work, with the Jets having Offensive Rookie of the Year Garrett Wilson on the outside as well as newcomers Allen Lazard, who he built a rapport with in Green Bay, and Mecole Hardman. Running back Breece Hall also had a fantastic start to his rookie year before a season-ending injury cut things short. He should be set to go for training camp.

That obviously wasn't the case. The Jets and Packers had stalled talks in recent weeks, but they were reactivated on Monday and things moved quicker than expected.

Now, with the picks agreed upon, both teams have the ability to head into Draft Night without the Rodgers elephant in the room. AARON RODGERS TRADE TALKS PIQUE INTERESTS OF NFL SCHEDULE MAKERS The Packers selected Rodgers with the 24th pick of the 2005 NFL Draft. He fell to the bottom of the first round after the San Francisco 49ers decided to take Alex Smith No. 1 overall that year. Rodgers served as Favre’s understudy for three seasons before taking the reins. He won his lone Super Bowl title in 2010 and won his first MVP award in 2011. With the Packers, he racked up 10 Pro Bowl appearances and four First-Team All-Pro selections.

He was fined more than $14,000 for violating the NFL’s health and safety protocols. The quarterback’s back-and-forth in the media and views on getting the coronavirus vaccine made him the target of criticism even as he won his fourth MVP award. In 2022, Rodgers decided to play for the Packers despite the team trading his top target in Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders. He reworked his contract ahead of the season but with a depleted offense he failed to lead Green Bay to the playoffs. He had 3,695 passing yards and 26 touchdown passes as the Packers finished 8-9.

When he returned, things didn’t get any better and criticism of the second-year quarterback got louder. Wilson was benched twice this past season — the first time came after he said he felt like he did not let his defense down after a 10-3 loss in which he threw for 77 yards and completed nine of 22 passes amid his struggles all year. He sat out three games before returning, but in his second game back, he was benched mid-game for another poor performance. The Jets opted to sit him for the rest of the year, claiming that it actually would be better for his growth to not play in meaningless games.

Colorado head coach Deion Sanders kicked off a new era for the Buffaloes by inviting 98-year-old superfan Peggy Coppom to handle the opening kickoff. A packed crowd standing in the snow was sent into a frenzy. There was a chance the spring game would get postponed due to snow. But Sanders said the team prayed on it, so game on. The game was different, with scrimmaging only during the first period due to field conditions, but the fans did not seem to care. A packed house welcomed Coach Prime onto the field with a standing ovation, and the head coach took a bow to thank those who came out. Sanders strolled onto the field wearing a white cowboy hat, playing up to the crowd at every opportunity. Colorado has a long way to go before the 2023 season, but the excitement level was evident at Folsom Field. The crowd went crazy after Travis Hunter scored the first touchdown.

Rockets agree to make Ime Udoka next head coach after Celtics scandal: report,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Houston Rockets have reportedly agreed to a deal to make Ime Udoka, who was dismissed by the Boston Celtics after having an inappropriate workplace relationship prior to his season, their next head coach. Udoka was rumored to be the Rockets’ top option after they fired Stephen Silas following another awful season. Silas went 59-177 with the team in 236 games over the last three seasons. ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski noted that the Rockets consulted with the league office and the Celtics regarding Udoka’s departure from the organization. They clearly didn’t mind what they were told, as Wojnarowski added that they ""moved fairly quickly"" to finding a deal after an initial meeting.

Both sides had some strong options in the marketplace but a deal got done in the last 24 hours to land Udoka with the Rockets,"" Wojnarowski tweeted. The Celtics initially suspended Udoka for the entire 2022-23 NBA season after they found his relationship with a female staff member ""was considered to be a violation of the organization’s guidelines."" Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck said the organization did a monthslong investigation on the matter. IME UDOKA MADE CRUDE REMARKS THAT LED TO YEARLONG SUSPENSION: REPORT ""We learned over the summer, some part of the summer, that there was a situation,"" Grousbeck said at the time. ""Called in the law firm at that point and the investigation had some twists and turns and took some time to develop all the facts. It finally concluded, for now, everything we know was wrapped up two days ago… ""I took a lot of advice from partners like [Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens] and others. We collectively came to this and got there, but it was not clear what to do. But it was clear that something substantial needed to be done, in my view, and it was.""

I am sorry for putting the team in this difficult situation, and I accept the team’s decision. Out of respect for everyone involved, I will have no further comment,"" Udoka said in a statement following the Celtics’ announcement that he would be suspended. Udoka, 45, had been with actress Nia Long since 2010. Long is known for her roles in ""Big Momma’s House,"" ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" and ""Love Jones"" among others. The two have one son, and she had a son from a previous relationship. They reportedly split in December months after the cheating scandal came to light. CELTICS SUSPEND IME UDOKA FOR ENTIRE 2022-23 SEASON FOR ‘VIOLATION OF TEAM POLICIES’ The Celtics reached the 2022 NBA Finals in Udoka’s first year as their head coach, which led many to believe Udoka could be one of the next great leaders in an NBA locker room. Instead, after the scandal, Joe Mazzulla was named the interim head coach of the Celtics in Udoka’s absence, but he’s since had that interim title dropped as he received an extension to remain in place as head coach following a successful regular season. The Celtics went 57-25 this season, earning them the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference.

Frederick Gaudreau gave the Wild another opening on his power-play goal with 1:20 left, but Oettinger didn't budge.

They sure could've used his stick and strength around the goal to knock in a rebound against Oettinger, the unflappable young goalie who grew up in Lakeville about a half-hour drive from downtown St. Paul. The Wild created plenty of prime chances with their attack, but their passing game was just a bit off. Foligno was denied twice on one breakaway, the rebound try deflected by Oettinger's pad. Wild star Kirill Kaprizov, who scored in Game 1 but has been hounded and pounded by the Stars all series, had a breakaway shot brushed aside by Oettinger, too. The 24-year-old Oettinger made a postseason name for himself a year ago with a 64-save effort in the Game 7 overtime loss to Calgary.

Taylor Hall and Jake DeBrusk each scored twice, Linus Ullmark stopped 41 shots and the Boston Bruins beat the Florida Panthers 6-2 in an Eastern Conference first-round playoff game Sunday. Brad Marchand and Tyler Bertuzzi also had goals for the Bruins, who took a 3-1 lead in the series by getting a second consecutive win on Florida ice. Hall added two assists, and both of his goals came in the final 3:36 — the second one an empty-netter. Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Bennett had goals for Florida, while Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 25 shots for the Panthers, who’ll try to fend off elimination when they visit Boston for Game 5 on Wednesday.

Ullmark wound up getting a misconduct penalty, ending his day a bit early. Hall put it away with 3:36 left, getting behind Florida's defense and beating Bobrovsky easily for a 5-2 edge that sent Panthers fans to the exits — possibly for the last time this season. All Boston needs to do now is avoid a three-game losing streak in order to reach the second round for the fifth time in the past six seasons. The Bruins dropped three in a row only once all season, on their way to having the best regular-season mark in NHL history — 65-12-5. Sunday’s win was Boston’s 68th of the season; only 10 teams, including playoffs, have ever won more in a single season. Both of DeBrusk’s goals put Boston on top by two — the first a power-play score 1:52 into the second for a 2-0 lead, the other when he merely had to swipe a puck that popped out of Bobrovsky’s glove into the net for a 4-2 edge with 11:55 remaining.

It was 1-0 Boston after the first 20 minutes. And about three seconds after that period ended, the Bruins found themselves on the brink of a bigger advantage. DOUGIE HAMILTON NETS OVERTIME WINNER FOR DEVILS IN HUGE GAME 3 WIN AGAINST RANGERS AT MSG Boston’s Garnet Hathaway was part of a behind-the-net scrum as time expired, and Tkachuk decided to join in as well — getting caught cross-checking Hathaway in the process. That meant Boston would start the second period on the power play. And DeBrusk cashed in, tipping the puck past Bobrovsky with 8 seconds left in the power play. Marchand also got a power-play goal to open the scoring. Bobrovsky couldn’t cover the puck as he sat in the goal mouth and the Boston forward swept it under him and into the back of the net for a 1-0 lead. Florida was playing uphill the rest of the way. Tkachuk scored in the second to make it 2-1, Bennett banged home a rebound in the third on the power play to make it 3-2, but the Panthers never pulled even. The Panthers had two notable lineup changes — Bobrovsky was in, Aaron Ekblad was out.

""We did before and after videos of the house that I directly sent to Karl…showing him the before and after thinking we’re on the same page,"" Leonard explained. ""We’re both from Neptune, both successful. Like ‘Hey man, check out the new digs.’ ""He used those before and after videos to map out my house basically and know where the bedroom was.

However, the video evidence changed his mind. ""The body language, everything. That’s what set it all off,"" Leonard said about believing it was Roberson on video in his closet stealing his valuables. ""We knew from that point on it was Karl just from the body language, the build. Knowing him for 19 years, the mannerism. The little trot that he did out of the closet. It was very similar to his UFC jog around the ring. Every little thing knowing someone for that long I kinda just picked it up from there. ""I couldn’t unsee it as much as I wanted to."" If that was not enough, Leonard said Roberson had been liking and responding to his social media posts and tried to ""blend in"" when Leonard was sharing photos and video of the incident to spread the word about the burglary.

While the value of his jewelry was a large amount, Leonard’s peace of mind is something he can’t put a price on. He suffers from PTSD following his days in the Army, when he was deployed to Iraq for over 400 days from 2009-10, and having someone break into his home has been tough. Having it be someone he considered a friend makes it even worse. ""It’s not the same kid I grew up with. It’s not the same kid in those pictures,"" Leonard told Fox News Digital. ""I had no idea Karl has this other side of him and I’m very disappointed and feel betrayed."" Police held Roberson for approximately ""two to three weeks"" before he was eventually released.

"Rep. Tenney: Biden deserves 'less than zero' grade on handling COVID, responsible for 'devastated' economy","Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., discusses a record number of northern border encounters on 'Fox News Live.' Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., sharply criticized President Biden and his handling of the COVID pandemic Tuesday, saying during an interview with Fox News Digital that she would grade his leadership over the last three years as ""less than zero."" The Biden administration’s ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to lockdowns and vaccine mandates ruined peoples’ livelihoods, devastated the economy and did incalculable damage to constituents in her 24th Congressional District and others around the country, she said. ""It's about time,"" Tenney told Fox News Digital when asked about Biden formally ending the COVID national emergency, which he signed earlier this week. It had been in effect since March 2020. ""I have been calling for the end of the pandemic."" ""We focused on everybody with a one-sized fits all solution, which never works,"" the New Yorker told Fox News Digital. ""Instead of having a smart policy. We shut everybody down. We put our economy in peril. We hurt our communities, we lost livelihoods. They don't want to follow the science."" BIDEN 'NOT COMPETENT' TO BE PRESIDENT AFTER APPEARING TO ZONE OUT DURING MSNBC INTERVIEW: REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY Representative Claudia Tenney, a Republican from New York, scolded President Biden over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. (Ken Cedeno/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Tenney added: ""Joe Biden announced last year that the pandemic is over, so why continue with the mandates on vaccines? Why continue to put employers through difficult times and not be able to get people back to work? Students not being able to go to school or to enroll in classes?"" When asked whether the Biden administration was being honest with the American people, Tenney pointed to new information being revealed by Elon Musk, Matt Taibbi and others showing ""all of the ridiculous protocols and the falsities that have come out on COVID-19."" ""[They are] exposing the kind of ridiculous non-science, political reasons that the Biden administration and others have required this vaccine mandate or really had the lockdowns and put us in a position that we couldn't thrive,"" the Republican lawmaker said. ""Many people in many businesses have been hurt by these lockdowns and these closures and these vaccine mandates. People have lost their livelihoods."" ""They are not using science, and they're being exposed everywhere,"" she continued. ""Our own director of the CDC said that we've come to realize that the vaccines do not prevent the spread of this disease. So we're forcing everyone to be vaccinated, and it does nothing in deterring or stopping the spread of the disease. So why are we forcing healthy people to take the vaccine?"" President Biden kept the travel restrictions and vaccine mandates in place several months after other country resume pre-pandemic policies. (Julien Behal/Irish Government via Getty Images) People who were less susceptible to COVID and those ""less vulnerable"" should not have been forced to close their businesses, remain out of schools or surrender their livelihoods to haphazard restrictions, she contended. Tenney added: ""I'm talking about young people, college-age kids, teenagers, young children, athletes, that are elite athletes in the prime of their health, who have also maybe had COVID-19 and recovered. They completely disregarded the natural immunity."" REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY REACTS TO BIDEN APPEARING TO ZONE OUT DURING INTERVIEW: 'THIS IS SERIOUS' ""I think they've gotten comfortable with their control over the American people,"" the lawmaker speculated. Biden’s vaccine mandate and the policies of New York’s ""authoritarian"" Gov. Kathy Hochul continue to have an impact on those in her state, Tenney said. Nurses — ""who were heroes during the pandemic"" — are unable to assist in an ongoing nursing shortage because ""the Biden administration continued the vaccine mandate"" and Hochul ""would not let these people [who would not or could not get the vaccine] get back to work,"" she continued. ""And now, many of our rural hospitals in upstate New York are in peril,"" the Republican said. ""They're facing fiscal crises right now, where they may not even be allowed to stay open because of the loss of staff. The requirement to shut down entire wings of hospitals, not because, you know, they were over capacitated because they simply don't have the staff because the vaccine mandate and other rules put in place."" Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., is interviewed by CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images in her Longworth Building office on Tuesday, November 30, 2021.  (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) These policies are going to hurt these hospitals and others affected ""in the long run,"" she contented. ""We may not have enough hospital beds to even meet the needs of the people that need them now. And we could be in real crisis if we have another pandemic."" ""Finally, today, the president of the State University of New York system announced all 64 campuses now do not require the vaccine in order for students to attend college, which is great. This is one of the least vulnerable groups,"" Tenney said. Tenney has been vocal about her support for tennis star Novak Djokovic, who is ranked among the best in the world, as he was denied access to play in the United States last year due to the Biden administration’s vaccine mandates. ""I pleaded with Secretary Blinken and Joe Biden in the administration to let Djokovic play. Novak Djokovic had COVID-19 [and natural immunity]. He's extremely healthy. He's one of the healthiest people probably on the planet with his incredible record as a tennis player at his age. Even the USTA and other tennis organizations have urged that Djokovic should be allowed to play and be given a waiver,"" she explained. The Biden administration denied her request, but they allowed other members of the US Open to play without being vaccinated, so she believes their reasoning was not based on science but on politics. ""Ironically, Djokovic actually played in 2020 and 2021. Before we had a vaccine, so it's absurd,"" she said. ""This isn't science. It's politics, especially when it comes to Novak Djokovic because he doesn't hold the views that this administration holds politically. And so the last thing they're going to do is allow someone like Novak Djokovic, a waiver to come in. Regardless, I mean, sports should take us away from politics. And that's why I've been fighting so hard. This is symbolic of what's happened to Djokovic. And it's what we shouldn't be doing as a country."" Novak Djokovic of Serbia was denied access to play in the United States due to his vaccination status. (Clive Brunskill/Getty Images) Tenney told Fox News Digital that the last four years gave Americans an opportunity to see how the Trump administration initially tackled the COVID pandemic when the disease ""was very much an unknown."" ""There has been a lot of criticism of President Trump and his administration in this but [COVID] was very much an unknown. We couldn't get to the heart of what was happening,"" she said. ""China was covering up the issues, the World Health Organization was perpetuating lies and covering up the information. But now we find out that it is indeed a result of a lab leak."" PRESIDENT BIDEN TURNS HEADS WITH INSTAGRAM POST BRAGGING ABOUT INFLATION FALLING FROM ITS 'PEAK' Once COVID began spreading around the world, Trump took action to limit overseas flights. Biden did as well, but the New York Republican said Biden kept these travel restrictions in place long after they needed to be. The U.S. maintained COVID-travel limits for months after other country resumed their pre-pandemic travel policies. ""President Trump did put into place Operation Warp Speed to bring us a vaccine, though it was an experimental vaccine, it wasn't perfect. It wasn't mandated. And they encouraged people to take the vaccine,"" Tenney explained. ""But the mandates were really where the problem was. We didn't allow doctors to actually make a patient-client decision, making sure that they knew that the patient could or could not tolerate these vaccines, and what was the best course of treatment for them,"" she continued. Representative Claudia Tenney, a Republican from New York, applauded President Donald Trump's approach to the COVID pandemic as he provided information and federal assistance to states. (Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Tenney added: ""But instead, it was this government-knows-all, Joe Biden-knows-all. His administration, based on politics, shut everybody down."" While the Trump administration allowed states to dictate their own approach to the pandemic, the Biden administration ""shamed and shunned everyone who questioned"" how they governed. ""So I give Biden less than an F. And I give President Trump, you know, a decent score for at least trying to figure out what was happening. Vice President Pence issued guidelines to the states. They weren't mandates,"" the legislator continued. Passengers stand in line for a Frontier Airlines flight at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma, New York, on February 22, 2023.  (Steve Pfost/Newsday RM via Getty Images) While not providing a grade for her own New York leadership, Tenney stressed many actions of the governor exacerbated problems in the state. ""These things were very poorly handled by then-Governor Cuomo in the state of New York, which is why we had so many problems, administering the vaccine, getting solutions out of our state. Our supply chains were a disaster, which is why we couldn't get personal protective gear to people. All this stuff did not happen because of policies that were put in place,"" the lawmaker said. The Republican lawmaker recalled Biden’s last three years in office as a ""complete disaster"" and said she initially guessed he would have needed ""four years or potentially eight"" years to make the impact he has already made. AS PRESIDENT BIDEN CONSIDERS 2024 RUN, AMERICANS WEIGH IN ON WHETHER HE SHOULD But, Tenney said, Biden has ""nearly destroyed and erased all the gains that we made in the four years under President Trump."" ""We see our economy is in free fall. It's a disaster,"" she explained. ""Our international politics is a disaster, whether it's the debacle that happened in Afghanistan that undermine our credibility [and] left 13 dead service members. [We're] setting up weakness on energy. We are now no longer energy independent. We now are dependent on Venezuela [and] Saudi Arabia."" Tenney’s son is a Marine, so the death of 11 Marine Corps servicemembers was ""particularly devastating"" for her and other Marine Corps families. ""All of our service members are precious,"" she said. ""The sacrifices they make and their families make was completely disregarded by Joe Biden. He said he had no regrets. I mean, these are absurd lies to the American people."" She also said the Biden administration was continuing to try to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, the world's leading sponsor of terrorism. President Biden pauses while he speaks about the situation in Afghanistan in the East Room of the White House on August 26, 2021, in Washington, DC. At least 13 American service members were killed by suicide bomb attacks near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan.  (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Biden has also ""been unable to deter what happens between Putin, who is ruthlessly killing and murdering people in Ukraine, and the Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their survival,"" Tenney said. She continued: ""They're not getting assurances from Joe Biden and not getting the kind of support they need. The American people need a plan. What are we doing in Ukraine? Why are we spending so much of American money and not knowing what the plan is?"" Biden’s foreign policy has been ""chaos,"" she said, and current geo-political crises are so bad that ""the Chinese are intervening."" ""Our allies, Saudi Arabia, even Macron of France, are turning to the Chinese Communist Party,"" she added. ""This is a disaster."" As for moving on from Biden in 2024, Tenney said the American people ""need leadership now."" ""They don't need a bumbling old man who is incompetent, who has always been incompetent on foreign policy and every other issue [and] who is corrupt,"" she said, mentioning the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, and potential business connections through his son in Ukraine and China. Potential voters in 2024 are ""looking for the kind of America first policies that President Trump brought,"" Tenney claimed. ""I think people are looking for strong leadership, competent leadership."" ""They're looking for decisive action, they're looking for a leader who will stand up to our enemies stand up to China, rebuild our economy, because the most important defense that we have as a nation is a strong economy,"" she continued, because ""when the United States is strong and when we're vibrant on the economy, the world is more peaceful."" Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., said she would be open to backing several Republicans in the 2024 presidential election. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The representative said there were ""a lot of really great candidates"" among Republicans, including those who have already announced their candidacies like former President Trump, Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.

"Portland, Maine's 'Valentine's Day Bandit' identified after dying at 67","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The identity of the so-called Valentine’s Day bandit, responsible for leaving hundreds of red hearts in downtown Portland for more than four decades, has been revealed in death. Kevin Fahrman, of Falmouth, was chief instigator of a group of feel-good pranksters who struck every year on Feb. 14, family and friends said, a tradition that put smiles on people’s faces while leaving behind an enduring mystery of who was responsible. He was 67 when he died late Thursday. Portland Mayor Kate Snyder said it was sad to lose such a local treasure ""and bittersweet to have him revealed."" HOW TO SEND VALENTINES TO KIDS IN HOSPITALS, NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND MORE ""The Valentine’s Day bandit has given so much to the Portland community. His gift of love was anticipated by so many each February. I hope the tradition continues — it would be a wonderful tribute to someone who brought love and hope to all of us annually,"" the mayor said. The love and levity started in the mid-1970s before Fahrman took it over in 1979. Over the years, simple white sheets of paper with large red hearts appeared in Old Portland and in downtown on Feb. 14. The hearts were plastered on storefronts and business windows. Kevin Fahrman, 67, was posthumously identified as Portland, Maine's ""Valentine's Day Bandit,"" a mysterious prankster who attained local celebrity through his anonymous, elaborate displays of large red hearts in the city's downtown every February. It grew more elaborate over the years, with larger hearts appearing in unusual places, like Fort Gorges in Portland Harbor, and over the entrance of the Portland Library. This year, a big heart was draped from the city’s tallest building, an 18-floor apartment tower, which is still under construction. It was a courtship made in heaven — Fahrman loved Portland, and Portland loved him back. Fahrman was an accomplished photographer, and one of his favorite subjects was SailMaine. Fahrman’s daughter was involved in sailing, and she was one of his subjects. The Valentine effort went to great lengths. OTTERS AT NEW HAMPSHIRE AQUARIUM SPREAD VALENTINE'S DAY LOVE BY 'PAINTING' THEIR OWN VALENTINES It was no small feat to put a giant heart on an old fort in the Portland Harbor, reachable only by boat, by the dark of night in February, or from high vantages like the top of an 18-floor apartment building, the state’s largest building.

Georgia Power bills likely to rise by 12% in June,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. State regulatory staff and Georgia Power Co. have agreed on a plan that will boost power bills by 12% in June to cover the higher costs of natural gas and coal that the utility burns to generate electricity for its 2.7 million customers. The unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. filed new figures Monday saying it needs to collect an additional $6.6 billion from customers over the next three years, under an agreement it reached with Georgia Public Service Commission staff earlier this month. Because of declining natural gas price forecasts, that's actually $1.1 billion less than Georgia Power had earlier projected. But it will boost a typical residential bill to $147.50 a month, up $15.90 from the current $131.60. The increase had originally been predicted to be as high as $23. The five-member elected commission is scheduled to vote on fuel charges on May 16. Any final plan is likely to closely track the agreement between the company and the staff. Bill increases are stacking up for Georgia Power customers. Rates went up 2.5% last month in January after commissioners approved a three-year rate plan in December. Increases of 4.5% will follow in 2024 and 2025. Customers will also have to pay the costs of the third and fourth nuclear units at Plant Vogtle near Augusta. Unit 3 is projected to begin operation in May or June, leading to a roughly $4 a month increase for residential customers. A larger rate increase is likely to follow when Unit 4 begins operations, now projected before March 2024. GEORGIA BOY, 13, CHARGED IN EASTER SUNDAY MURDER OF MAN SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES Typically, a utility is allowed to charge customers for the cost of fuel, but isn’t allowed to make a profit on those charges, unlike the profits Georgia Power is guaranteed for investing in power plants and transmission lines. The all-Republican commission typically decides how much Georgia Power can collect for fuel once every two years. In the meantime, if prices change, the company may collect too much or too little. During this two-year period, even though commissioners approved a 15% boost in fuel costs that began in January 2022, the company collected far too little money. Natural gas prices skyrocketed because of an improving economy and the Ukraine war, and coal prices rose even more steeply in part because of supply and labor shortages. Georgia Power Co. and state regulatory staff agreed on a plan that will likely rise power bills by 12% in June. Georgia Power says it will end the period roughly $4.5 billion in the hole for fuel already burned. Most of the proposed rate increase will make up for that deficit, repaying the company over three years instead of the normal two because the debt is so large. The utility says it forecasts it also needs another $2.2 billion to make up for higher fuel prices going forward. Georgia Power and commission staff have agreed to let the company make larger changes to cover cost swings between fuel-cost rate cases. The agreement would let Georgia Power raise or lower fuel charges by as much as 40% in the interim, instead of the current 15%. Because of unrecovered debt, that ability would likely only be used to further raise customer bills in the next two years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The company and staff also agreed to raise a fuel cost discount for low-income senior citizens from $6 a month now to $8 a month. The Georgia Association of Manufacturers argues commissioners should stretch repayment of the deficit out over five years to reduce rate increases. Georgia Power said Monday it opposes a longer payback period. Environmentalists argue that commissioners should force Georgia Power to bear some rising fuel costs because it has shifted its generation portfolio to depend on natural gas, whose price is volatile. The company argues the commission has already approved the current generation mix as the most economical and reliable option. ",674,us

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) In March, in the decade anniversary of Francis’ tenure as pope, some of Argentina’s most prominent political leaders from different political stripes called on the pope to visit his native country. ""Although we desire and long for your visit, we trust in your wisdom to say yes and eventually when,"" wrote the signatories, which included Fernández, Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta. VATICAN REVIVES ARTISAN ACADEMY IN ST. PETER'S BASILICA In his conversation with La Nación, the pope once again called on Argentines not to associate him with local politics. In recent interviews with various media outlets, Francis stated he has no desire to be connected to any political parties in the polarized South American country. Analysts have often said the pontiff has been postponing a visit to his homeland to make sure his presence isn’t used by either side of the political divide.

Newly-formed nonprofit seeks to buy most of Maine newspapers,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A newly formed nonprofit group headed by a longtime Maine journalist wants to buy most of the newspapers in the state. Members of the group, Maine Journalism Foundation, said Monday they hope to buy Masthead Maine, which owns the Portland Press Herald, the state's largest daily newspaper, and 29 other daily and weekly papers. Masthead Maine's owner told staff in March that he's considering selling the media holdings. The potential buy comes as some newspapers around the country have explored not-for-profit models to try to achieve sustainability.

A veteran Maine journalist's nonprofit aims to buy out Masthead Maine, a company that oversees 30 local newspapers.

Georgia Power bills likely to rise by 12% in June,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. State regulatory staff and Georgia Power Co. have agreed on a plan that will boost power bills by 12% in June to cover the higher costs of natural gas and coal that the utility burns to generate electricity for its 2.7 million customers. The unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. filed new figures Monday saying it needs to collect an additional $6.6 billion from customers over the next three years, under an agreement it reached with Georgia Public Service Commission staff earlier this month. Because of declining natural gas price forecasts, that's actually $1.1 billion less than Georgia Power had earlier projected. But it will boost a typical residential bill to $147.50 a month, up $15.90 from the current $131.60. The increase had originally been predicted to be as high as $23. The five-member elected commission is scheduled to vote on fuel charges on May 16. Any final plan is likely to closely track the agreement between the company and the staff. Bill increases are stacking up for Georgia Power customers. Rates went up 2.5% last month in January after commissioners approved a three-year rate plan in December. Increases of 4.5% will follow in 2024 and 2025. Customers will also have to pay the costs of the third and fourth nuclear units at Plant Vogtle near Augusta. Unit 3 is projected to begin operation in May or June, leading to a roughly $4 a month increase for residential customers. A larger rate increase is likely to follow when Unit 4 begins operations, now projected before March 2024. GEORGIA BOY, 13, CHARGED IN EASTER SUNDAY MURDER OF MAN SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES Typically, a utility is allowed to charge customers for the cost of fuel, but isn’t allowed to make a profit on those charges, unlike the profits Georgia Power is guaranteed for investing in power plants and transmission lines. The all-Republican commission typically decides how much Georgia Power can collect for fuel once every two years. In the meantime, if prices change, the company may collect too much or too little. During this two-year period, even though commissioners approved a 15% boost in fuel costs that began in January 2022, the company collected far too little money. Natural gas prices skyrocketed because of an improving economy and the Ukraine war, and coal prices rose even more steeply in part because of supply and labor shortages. Georgia Power Co. and state regulatory staff agreed on a plan that will likely rise power bills by 12% in June. Georgia Power says it will end the period roughly $4.5 billion in the hole for fuel already burned. Most of the proposed rate increase will make up for that deficit, repaying the company over three years instead of the normal two because the debt is so large. The utility says it forecasts it also needs another $2.2 billion to make up for higher fuel prices going forward. Georgia Power and commission staff have agreed to let the company make larger changes to cover cost swings between fuel-cost rate cases. The agreement would let Georgia Power raise or lower fuel charges by as much as 40% in the interim, instead of the current 15%. Because of unrecovered debt, that ability would likely only be used to further raise customer bills in the next two years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The company and staff also agreed to raise a fuel cost discount for low-income senior citizens from $6 a month now to $8 a month. The Georgia Association of Manufacturers argues commissioners should stretch repayment of the deficit out over five years to reduce rate increases. Georgia Power said Monday it opposes a longer payback period. Environmentalists argue that commissioners should force Georgia Power to bear some rising fuel costs because it has shifted its generation portfolio to depend on natural gas, whose price is volatile. The company argues the commission has already approved the current generation mix as the most economical and reliable option. ",674,us

"Some doctors providing trans procedures to minors consider quitting, retiring as GOP pressure mounts: report","Former transgender kid, Chloe Cole, shares the complications she deals with every day as a result of medical interventions she was subjected to after being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. ""I'm not sure whether it'll even go away,"" she said. Some physicians, frustrated by state GOP bans on gender reassignment procedures for minors, are considering quitting their jobs and retiring early, according to a Sunday report in Politico. Most recently, North Dakota’s Republican Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill into law that immediately made it illegal to provide sex change operations to minors. Other states with bans on transgender treatment for children include Florida, Georgia, Missouri and more than 10 others. Politico interviewed doctors in states with bans or restrictions on medical interventions on minors, which includes surgeries, hormones and puberty blockers – also called gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH). GnRH is also used for patients with testicular cancer. Politico reported, ""While some doctors, especially those early in their careers, said the bans have inspired them to work harder and continue providing this kind of care, others who are older said they have considered quitting or retiring early — though they acknowledge doing so would make it even harder for their patients to receive care."" Gender-affirming care has been called ""life-saving"" by multiple medical associations. Its critics raise concerns about the long-term effects on the minor cohort, of which there is limited research, and the ability to consent.  (Adobe Stock ) NIH STUDY RECRUITING 18-YEAR-OLDS TO LEARN 'UNKNOWN' SIDE EFFECTS OF TESTICLE REMOVAL FOR GENDER DYSPHORIA Physicians also complained about harassment and threats, according to Politico. ""I got an email telling me that I’m evil, I’m foolish, my work is opposing God, that I harm children, that I’m going to hell, and that I should die,"" said Meredithe McNamara, an assistant professor of pediatrics who specializes in adolescent medicine at Yale University. ""The threats, the harassment, the constant fear of, ‘Did I say that right? Is that OK? Should I have said that differently? Did I present my position in a public space as effectively as possible, and also did I say anything that is going to get my family targeted in some way?’"" she wondered.

""It affects the families in the states where care is banned, and it affects the families in the states where the care is not.""’ Proponents of ""gender-affirming care"" for minors say it is ""medically necessary"" and a ""life-saving"" treatment for a population with an extremely high rate of suicide.

""We are increasingly alarmed that HHS’ advocacy has led health professionals to prescribe dangerous and experimental drugs and surgeries to troubled children — in many cases covered with taxpayer dollars,"" the lawmakers wrote.

ChatGPT life hacks: How users are spawning grocery lists from AI-generated recipes and meal plans,"A New York Rabbi recently went viral for delivering a sermon written by ChatGPT to his congregation, causing many to question the humanity in such an act. Kurt ""The CyberGuy"" Knutsson reports. The emergence of generative AI is opening a whole new world of life hacks. The most recent trick in the book is spawning AI-generated recipes, meal plans and even grocery lists from ChatGPT. A hack recently went viral on TikTok after user Mellyssa Viele posted a video about how she used ChatGPT to create a diet-specific, seven-day meal plan. CHATGPT FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: CAN THE AI CHATBOT MAKE THE PROFESSIONALS' JOBS EASIER? Viele prompted the chatbot to come up with a plan that is endometriosis-friendly, good for hormone imbalances in women and helps reduce inflammation. ChatGPT was quick to fill Viele’s request, whittling down the meal plan each time she asked for something new, such as keeping each day under 1,700 calories and incorporating snacks. ""It just keeps getting better and better,"" she said in the video. ""This thing is so smart."" Viele explained that she continued to feed ChatGPT input on what she liked, including removing tuna from the mix, until she was satisfied with meals for all seven days. CHATGPT AND HEALTH CARE: COULD THE AI CHATBOT CHANGE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE? ChatGPT even took into consideration how some dinners could be eaten as leftovers for lunch the next day. Viele then asked ChatGPT to create a grocery list according to the specific meal plan it had created. ""It gives me a grocery list … of every single ingredient, everything that I need,"" she said. ""And it categorizes by produce, pantry, meats."" Viele’s TikTok video currently has nearly 3 million views. She told Fox News Digital that, as a person who works in tech, ChatGPT immediately intrigued her. ""I probably have asked ChatGPT 200 questions before landing on the idea of using it for meal plans and workout plans,"" she wrote in a text message. AI HEALTH CARE PLATFORM PREDICTS DIABETES WITH HIGH ACCURACY BUT 'WON'T REPLACE PATIENT CARE' As an endometriosis sufferer of nearly 10 years, Viele said she’d done months’ worth of research to nail down a diet that would help reduce inflammation, pain and bloating. Viele asked ChatGPT to create a seven-day meal plan for her that is endometriosis-friendly, good for hormone imbalances in women and helpful in reducing inflammation. (iStock) ""I had a rough idea of what foods are good [for endometriosis] and which to avoid,"" she said. ""But putting it all together in a cohesive schedule/plan was a bit tedious, so ChatGPT impressed me there."" Viele encouraged others to try out ChatGPT for meal planning and recipe building.

Does ginger ale really cure nausea and upset stomach? Here's what doctors and dieticians say,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Many people around the world turn to ginger ale when they're feeling sick — but the bubbly drink may not be an effective treatment method, according to medical and nutrition experts. The ginger-flavored soft drink has long been rumored to be a cure for nausea, upset stomach, vomiting and other gastrointestinal illnesses, though it’s unclear why people believe the soda has healing properties. A 2019 survey commissioned by Reed’s, Inc., a soft drink company, found that the ginger ale myth has been passed down through families. CANADA DRY SETTLES GINGER ALE LAWSUIT OVER 'REAL GINGER' CLAIMS, AGREES TO PAY OVER $200G The survey, which didn’t disclose its sample size, claimed that 86% of mothers said they learned about the ginger ale idea from their parents or grandparents. Nearly nine in 10 (88%) mothers reportedly admitted serving ginger soda to children and other family members to soothe upset stomachs. The ginger-flavored soft drink has long been rumored to be a cure for nausea, upset stomach, vomiting and other gastrointestinal illnesses. (iStock) Doctors and dietitians are sounding off to put the myth to rest — and explaining what scientists know about ginger. Liudmila Schafer, a gastrointestinal oncologist from Kansas City, Missouri, and founder of ""The Doctor Connect"" health show, told Fox News Digital that ginger ales on the market use artificial flavors instead of real ginger. ""Ginger ale consists of sugary flavored water, which is not helping with nausea,"" Schafer said. She continued, ""Ginger ale has a lot of carbohydrates, sugar and calories, which is not recommended for diabetes or [those] who are predisposed to diabetes mellitus, which is a large population."" NUTRITIONIST RECOMMENDS THESE DISHES TO HELP YOU FIGHT OFF A COLD OR THE FLU Medical experts have found that servings of ginger ""accelerate stomach emptying"" and ""stimulate motility known contractions"" — how food moves through the stomach and digestive tract — which could make ginger ale seem like it’s helping a sick patient if there’s real ginger in the drink, according to Schafer. Gingerol, the phenolic phytochemical found in fresh ginger, is the compound that makes ginger a nausea aid. Bottles of Canada Dry Ginger Ale move down a conveyor belt after being filled at the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. bottling plant in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday, April 21, 2015. Most ginger ale producers have a low ginger root content, according to doctors and dietitians. (Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""Gingerol stimulates saliva, bile and gastric secretions, which compete at serotonin receptors 5-HT3, and that is why natural ginger helps with nausea but is very little known [regarding] an upset stomach,"" Schafer said. Ginger supplements, she also warned, can increase a person’s risk of bleeding, which poses a danger for people who take blood-thinning medications. Most of the ginger ale brands sold in stores are made with ginger flavoring or extracts, Michelle Rauch, a registered dietitian at The Actors Fund Home, an assisted-living facility, in Englewood, New Jersey, told Fox News Digital. Ginger beer, on the other hand, tends to be made with ginger root, the spice plant that has been used in herbal medicines and supplements for centuries. SHOULD YOU DRINK WATER BEFORE BED? EXPERTS CHIME IN ""Ginger root has been long associated with addressing nausea and other gastrointestinal symptoms,"" Rauch said. ""Most commercial ginger ales contain little or no actual ginger,"" she added. Ginger ale is sometimes made with real ginger root, while ginger beer is always made with ginger root due to its specified fermentation process. (iStock) Gingerol, which is found in ginger root, has been shown to offer nausea relief as the compound improves digestion by reducing the time food remains in the stomach and gut, said Rauch. If beverage consumers desire a drink with real ginger, Rauch said she recommends they check a bottle or can of ginger soda to see if its nutrition panel sheds light on whether ginger root is listed as an ingredient. ""To make the most of the benefits of ginger, you could consider ginger ales with higher ginger concentrations."" ""Diet versions of ginger ale may contain sugar alcohols, such as mannitol and sorbitol, which can cause stomach upset and loose stools when taken in excess,"" Rauch warned. Most commercially available ginger ale brands are made with ""carbonated water, sugar, coloring and very little ginger extract, if any at all,"" said Jesse Feder, a Florida-based registered dietitian, personal trainer and contributor to My Crohn’s and Colitis Team support group. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS ""Overall, ginger ale will not help alleviate an upset stomach,"" Feder also told Fox News Digital. Ginger ale is a soft drink made with sugar, artificial flavors and/or ginger root extract. Many people believe the drink has healing properties as scientists have found fresh ginger offers a nausea-easing effect. (iStock) ""However, the relief of expelling the carbonation from ginger ale can feel good and feel like you are reducing bloating. It is more of a placebo effect.""

Kansas nonprofit provides 'Keepsake Sets' to honor 'angel' babies: Family grief 'matters',"World's most premature and lightest twins on record turned one in March. Their parents spoke with Fox News Digital about how their faith in God sustained them during their long and scary hospital stay. A Kansas mother who knows the wrenching heartache of losing a baby has turned her grief into a mission to help others. She assembles keepsake sets to honor short but precious lives. When Amanda Smith went into labor in a hospital in Wichita, with her son Robby in February 2012, she was just over 22 weeks pregnant. When Robby was born three days later, on Feb. 24, 2012, he was considered to be below the point of viability — and lived for just two hours, she told Fox News Digital. ""Robby was born at 1 pound 4.4 ounces and 12 inches long. He was early and tiny, but he was perfect,"" Smith also said. TODDLER'S UNEXPECTED HUG SURPRISES PIZZA DELIVERY MAN GRIEVING LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER: 'IT JUST MEANT A TON TO ME' As she and her husband Tanner had expected to have several more weeks of preparation before their child's arrival, they were not prepared in the slightest. ""We didn't have a camera and we didn't have a special hat or blanket for him,"" she said. ""Our kind nurse searched high and low for a hat at the hospital that would be small enough to fit his tiny head."" Although there weren't any small enough to fit the head of a baby just over a pound and a quarter, a nurse came with a ""very precious small blue hat with a pom-pom at the top,"" Smith said. Parents Tanner and Amanda Smith, along with their baby, Robby, shortly after their son was born prematurely in 2012.  (Project Robby) And while the hat was ""entirely too big,"" it became incredibly special to Smith in the wake of her little one's passing. ""Even after I no longer had Robby to hold onto, I had his hat,"" she said. ""That little blue hat brought me comfort on countless occasions when I needed to feel close to him."" ""It isn’t just a hat. It represents Robby’s life. It was a short life, but he mattered; he was loved, and he was here."" ""I slept with it, I carried it around in my hoodie pocket when I was at home, and when I left I put it into my purse and took it along,"" she continued. ""I didn’t have my baby, but I had that small piece of him."" MAINE MOM RAISES THE ALARM AFTER HER BABY DAUGHTER NEARLY DIES FROM SWALLOWING A WATER BEAD As Smith progressed in her grief, she said she ""stopped relying on the comfort of that hat."" She continued, ""It isn’t just a hat. It represents Robby’s life. It was a short life, but he mattered; he was loved, and he was here. That hat is a physical reminder of his existence."" About two-and-a-half years after her son died, Smith was moved by the recent death of her grandfather — whom Robby was named after — to channel her grief into something more concrete to honor her son. ""I realized that the way to honor his life would be to collect tiny hats and blankets for the hospital … where he was born."" ""I just didn’t know what or how,"" she said. ""On a day that I was having a particularly difficult grief day, as I was holding Robby’s hat, I realized that the way to honor his life would be to collect tiny hats and blankets for the hospital in Wichita, Kansas, where he was born,"" she said. ""I started by contacting the hospital where he was born to ask if they needed this type of donation, and they very excitedly said ‘yes,’ as they didn’t receive donations like that."" Smith and her mother enlisted the help of family and friends to help make the blankets and hats — at the time, neither of them knew how to crochet. Project Robby's Kansas headquarters is shown here; it contains handmade crocheted items organized by size and waiting to be sent to grieving families. (Project Robby) She also turned to her blog, which she had started to document her pregnancy with Robby. Following his death, she wrote about how she was handling the grief. ""I decided to write out our story and talk about his hat, how important it was (and still is) to me, and why I wanted to be able to donate tiny hats for babies born prematurely who unfortunately don’t survive,"" she said. ""I was so worried that we wouldn’t reach our goal."" Her initial goal was to donate 50 hats and 50 blankets, with a stretch goal of 100 hats and 100 blankets. ""I was so worried that we wouldn’t reach our goal,"" she said. NEW YORK MOM DESCRIBES HAVING A BABY AFTER CANCER: 'SCIENCE IS INCREDIBLE' As it turned out, she did not have much to worry about. The blog post was shared around the world, and from August 2014 until February 2015, friends, families and complete strangers donated enough hats and blankets to fill 13 Rubbermaid containers, said Smith. ""I honestly thought after we delivered our donation to [the hospital] that we would be done and our ‘project’ would be completed,"" she continued. ""I believe our hearts really lead us."" This was far from the case: What would become ""Project Robby"" was just beginning. Other hospitals from across the U.S. heard about Smith's donation of tiny hats and blankets. They began reaching out, seeing if they, too, could receive blankets and hats for their smallest patients. Baby Robby Smith only lived for two hours when he was born at 23 weeks' gestation on Feb. 24, 2012, in Wichita, Kansas.  (Project Robby) ""This is when we started working toward becoming a nonprofit organization, so we could continue our mission of helping families with angel babies,"" said Smith. Smith named the nonprofit Project Robby after her son. Smith and her mother run the 100% volunteer group out of their headquarters in Kansas. ""After our initial donation,"" said Smith, ""we continued to receive many different items from amazing ladies all over the world."" ""Pregnancy and Infant loss can be an uncomfortable topic for our society, but it is an important topic."" Among these items were hats, blankets, booties, cradles, cocoons and most notably, angel wings. WHAT ARE ‘ANGEL NUMBERS’ AND WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SEEING THEM? ""When we started to receive angel wings in the mail from different crocheters, we decided that we would add the angel wings to each Project Robby Bereavement Set, and when we started the Keepsake Set program, we decided to add the angel wings to those as well,"" Smith said. Two Project Robby Keepsake Sets are shown here. Amanda Smith and her mother assemble all the sets by hand; they rely on instinct when picking out items. (Project Robby) The Keepsake Set program began in 2017, when Smith realized that some women who lost their babies early in pregnancy had nothing physical to represent their children. Or, perhaps they were not far enough along in their pregnancy to be in labor or to be cared for in a hospital's delivery unit. ""When I say that we care about their grief and their baby, I mean it with my whole heart."" A Project Robby Keepsake Set contains a size-appropriate hat, blanket and angel wings for individuals who have lost children from four to 36 weeks gestation. AIR FORCE VET WHO BATTLED TOUGH FERTILITY ISSUE TELLS OTHERS, ‘KNOWLEDGE IS POWER’ Bereavement sets, sized for children from 18 to 40 weeks gestation, are provided to both hospitals and bereavement photographers for children who are born too early and will not survive. Those who request Project Robby Keepsake Sets are able to request a specific color. Many parents who lose children very early on do not know if their child was a boy or a girl — and request something gender-neutral to honor their child. (Project Robby) ""For so many families, especially those who experience losses at earlier gestations, [the Project Robby Keepsake Set] is their only physical reminder of their baby,"" said Smith. ""I hear from a lot of families that receiving a Project Robby Keepsake Set helped them to know that someone else out there was remembering their baby with them,"" she added. She said it's often viewed as ""validation that their grief matters and their baby matters."" ""When I say that we care about their grief and their baby, I mean it with my whole heart. An important part of the grief journey is to have your grief validated, and that is what we do at Project Robby."" ""Our babies — no matter what gestation they were lost — matter."" For Smith and her mother, picking out the items in the Project Robby Keepsake Sets is a delicate process, she noted. Families who request Keepsake Sets are able to provide information about the gender (if known), name (if given) and any other information about their baby. INDIANA POLICE OFFICER AND HIS WIFE ADOPT INFANT GIRL ABANDONED IN ‘BABY BOX’ ""Most of the time, when picking out sets for families, I have had conversations with them either through their notes on their request form, emails or comments on our different social media pages,"" Smith noted. ""I believe our hearts really lead us,"" said Smith. While Smith believes what she does with Project Robby is worthwhile and important work, some days are easier than others. Three Project Robby Keepsake Sets, featuring hats for very small babies. (Project Robby) ""Loss is heavy,"" she explained. ""Each day I receive emails and messages from women and men who want to be able to share their stories with someone, and I don’t take that lightly."" Smith reads each story that is sent to her, she said. Many women request a set ""for losses 30, 40 and even 50-plus years"" ago. ""Some people are sharing their stories for the first time [with] someone other than family,"" she said. ""Pregnancy and Infant loss can be an uncomfortable topic for our society, but it is an important topic."" Smith also said, ""Our babies — no matter what gestation they were lost — matter."" FERTILITY DOCTOR’S UNIQUE WAY OF ANNOUNCING PREGNANCIES WARMS HEARTS On particularly hard days, Smith said she reads through emails from people who have gotten their Keepsake Sets. Robby was born on Feb. 24, 2012, at just over a pound. He became the inspiration for creating accessories correctly sized for premature babies.  (Project Robby) Many women have expressed gratitude for having something that could have belonged to their ""angel child"" — especially those who miscarried before they had an ultrasound or before they had a baby shower.

Conservative college grad who walked out of Merrick Garland's commencement speech 'would do it again',"'Fox & Friends' co-hosts discuss the possibility of obstruction in the Hunter Biden laptop investigation after the whistlebower allegations. College graduation season this year is nearly here — and scores of schools already have announced their commencement speakers ahead of the special occasion. As students of higher education finish up their coursework and prepare for commencement, a woman who made waves for standing up and walking out of Harvard University's commencement ceremony last year while Attorney General Merrick Garland was delivering his address said she would repeat her actions. Emma Heussner of Washington, D.C., earned a master's degree in psychology from Harvard. She walked out of her own graduation ceremony last year — fed up with the speech. HARVARD GRADUATE WALKS OUT OF MERRICK GARLAND'S COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS Heussner, who works in social media, said she absolutely would repeat it. ""I would do it again,"" she told Fox News Digital this weekend. Emma Heussner, at left, earned a master's degree in psychology from Harvard University. She's pictured at last year's commencement address. Attorney General Merrick Garland, at right, spoke at Harvard in 2022.  (Emma Heussner; AP Photo/Mary Schwalm) She explained why. ""Conservatives are coined as the ‘silent majority’ and look where that’s gotten us,"" she said. ""Students and their parents are now fighting for regular, not sexualized, curriculum in K-12."" She added, ""As long as conservatives are silent, we are compliant with how far we let the left push their agenda."" Heussner also said, ""Universities [should] be places that teach students how to think and challenge our beliefs. They should encourage students to debate and learn from other perspectives."" ""As long as conservatives are silent, we are compliant with how far we let the left push their agenda."" However, given today's reality, Heussner said that ""standing up for myself and my beliefs by walking out on Merrick Garland’s speech was a way for me to honor the time, money and energy spent earning my degree — while also honoring those who actually supported me throughout school."" And the ones who supported her, she said, were ""my friends and family who were cheering me on."" Emma Heussner is pictured last year at Harvard University with her parents. It was ""my friends and family,"" she said, ""who were cheering me on."" (Emma Heussner) She also told Fox News Digital this weekend about the response to her actions last year, ""The support I got from strangers on the internet was overwhelmingly positive. So many people I’ve never met rallied behind me,"" she added. She explained, ""I think that’s partially because there aren’t many signs of intelligent life (AKA conservatives at Ivy League schools) who make a statement by speaking out against the propaganda otherwise pushed on us as students.""

They believed it was hypocritical and ungrateful of me to not endure Garland’s speech."" Merrick Garland ""didn’t represent me or what my academic career taught me to think independently [about],"" said the Harvard graduate. However, she said, ""I think it was more important to spend my graduation with my family than waste time sitting through a politicized speech that made students like me feel unwelcome and complacent."" Garland's ideas, she said — and the content of his speech last year — ""didn’t represent me or what my academic career taught me to think independently [about]."" Rather, she said, his speech ""was ostracizing.""

(OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images) Last year, igniting strong reaction from many corners, she shared on Twitter that she had ""just walked out of Harvard’s graduation because I didn’t want to listen to Merrick Garland talk about himself for 30 minutes."" She added that what she did hear was ""pretty rich."" Heussner earned a master's degree in psychology from Harvard in 2020. ""But because of the pandemic, they weren't able to give us a formal graduation"" back then, she explained last year. ""Harvard did not have tickets for my parents — so they couldn't go in and watch the ceremony."" Instead, the graduation ceremony during Memorial Day weekend of May 2022 celebrated those who graduated in 2020 and 2021, she said. ""So I went up with my parents,"" she said about last year's graduation ceremony. ""But Harvard did not have tickets for my parents — so they couldn't go in and watch the ceremony,"" she said.

Garland seemed to be saying, ""This country sucks and you guys can fix it,"" said Heussner about the attorney general's commencement address. That ""didn't sit right with me."" ""But the way it read,"" she continued, ""was very much like, ‘This country sucks and you guys can fix it.’"" That ""didn't sit right with me,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Among Garland's comments at Harvard last year during his commencement address: ""It is a great comfort to see all of you in your robes. You look like little judges. I feel right at home,"" he said. (Some people laughed.) ""One of the reasons young people struggle so much with mental health these days is the societal fall from God."" Garland also said, according to a transcript of his remarks, ""When I was sitting where you are sitting today, there were many things to worry about. But it never occurred to me that the right to vote would again be threatened in this country.""

Reddit user slammed for wanting to sell a family heirloom in order to pay for a 'lavish' destination wedding,"Danni, a guest on Dr. Phil, explained that she had a $4,000 wedding ceremony with her friends and family watching as she married herself. Reddit users nearly universally criticized a man who floated the idea of selling a family heirloom he inherited to pay for his future ""memorable"" wedding. ""AITA for selling a family heirloom to pay for my destination wedding?"" asked Reddit user ""throwaway205813"" in a Friday, April 21, post in Reddit's ""Am I the A--hole"" subreddit. In the post, the writer explained that he's a 39-year-old man who is engaged to a 38-year-old woman, and they are getting married this summer. He did not share his location. REDDIT USERS SUPPORT WOMAN WHO TOLD HER SISTER ABOUT THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S 'HATED' BIRTH NAME ""We both want to have quite a lavish wedding at a winery in another state,"" wrote throwaway205813. ""The two of us agree that it's the most important occasion in our lives, so we should make it as memorable as possible,"" he said. The writer said he's a 39-year-old man engaged to a 38-year-old woman, and they are getting married this summer.  (iStock) While both he and his fiancée have ""stable jobs and a good amount of savings,"" that will not cover their ""admittedly ambitious"" plans for their wedding. In January, the man's father died, he said — leaving him a ""very valuable (think five figures) family heirloom."" REDDIT USERS SLAM MAN WHO TRICKED GIRLFRIEND INTO EATING FOOD SHE HATES: 'VIOLATION OF TRUST,' SAYS EXPERT In later replies in the thread, throwaway205813 explained that it's a ""very old painting by a lesser-known artist."" He added, ""I'm not much for big family traditions, so although it's a nice thing to have, I'm not massively attached to it. I have plenty of other good memories of my father and I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by."" His younger brother, however, is a ""huge history nerd"" — and is quite attached to the painting, said throwaway205813. ""I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by."" ""He was very upset by my father's decision in the will (the reason it went to me and not to him is that this has been traditionally passed to firstborn sons),"" wrote the man. ""My fiancée and I don't plan to have children, and I think he assumed therefore that he (or his children) would be in line to get it if I were to pass away."" The Redditor wrote that despite having a stable job and savings, he would not be able to afford the wedding of his and his bride-to-be's dreams unless he sold the heirloom he inherited.  (iStock) Instead, ""after some discussion,"" throwaway205813 and his fiancée decided they would like to sell the painting to pay for the wedding. This did not go over well with his younger brother — who was supposed to be the best man at the wedding.

REDDIT USER REMOVES TEENAGER'S DOOR AFTER GIRL WON'T STOP SLAMMING IT, IS LABELED 'EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE' Additionally, the younger brother ""convinced my uncle and cousins not to come to the wedding either,"" the man revealed. Since his parents are deceased, this means ""virtually none of my family will attend the wedding, which I'm really upset about."" He wrote as well, ""I think since I legally inherited the heirloom, I can do what I want with it. I think he's just upset because I ruined his expectations of one day inheriting it, but since my uncle and cousins agree with him enough that they're not coming to the wedding, I'm not so sure I'm in the right. AITA?"" The Redditor's brother, who was supposed to be the best man, dropped out of the wedding — and convinced other relatives not to go when he heard about the man's plan to sell the family heirloom.  (iStock) Fox News Digital reached out to throwaway205813 for comment.

"Spring cleaning: From your kitchen to the bathrooms, tidy each room with these tips","Cleaning expert and Tik Tok creator Brandon Pleshek gives cleaning advice for unconventional spaces around the home. Spring cleaning a home is an essential task that all homeowners should do once a year to ensure that everything runs smoothly in the household for the rest of the season. Make sure you have all the necessary cleaning items, such as a mop, vacuum, duster, bleach and wet wipes, so that the cleaning process is easier for you and your family. Keep reading to find out how to clean the specific and essential areas of your home. SPRING CLEANING: THE MOST IMPORTANT TIPS FOR CLEANING YOUR BATHROOM The kitchen is one of the most important areas of your home; it's the location, of course, for cooking your daily meals and hosting and celebrating holidays with friends and family. The cleanliness of your kitchen really says a lot about how you run your house, so follow these tips to ensure that your eating area is spotless and ready for meal preparation and cooking. A clean kitchen will make cooking for yourself and your family way easier on a daily basis. (iStock) First, you should start by cleaning out the pantry and throwing out any old canned goods or foods stored for over six months. After clearing out your cabinets, grab disinfectant spray and a towel to remove any dirt or grime. Next, mop up or vacuum your floors, especially areas blocked by the fridge or in tiny corners. You should always do a deep cleaning of your refrigerator at least a few times a year, so take some time this spring to complete this task. Start by removing all foods and items from the refrigerator and scrubbing individual compartments and drawers. Finally, use your oven's self-cleaning system to clear it out of any built-up oils or messes. Sweep up under the cabinets and around the baseboards. Often we'll sweep the middle of the floor and skip the crumbs that find their way to the corners. This is a prime spot for ants and other insects to accumulate during the warm months. Do a deeper clean of the countertops and thoroughly wash all the decorative items that are out. Clean out the freezer of anything that is old, looks freezer-burnt or might be stinking up the place. If something is giving the ice cubes a funky flavor, it might be time to pitch everything that isn't properly packed. Don't forget about your oven and stovetop. A buildup of oil, butter and grease from meats and other foods is a terrible task to have to complete weeks or months after the fact. The grime clings to all surface types in the worst way and some soap and a paper towel will no longer do the trick. Avoid an over-the-top arm workout and get to scrubbing the stove and oven ASAP. 7 WAYS TO SPRING CLEAN YOUR LIFE Do a deeper clean of the countertops and thoroughly wash all the decorative items that are out. It's easy to walk by them because you're so used to looking at them, but they accumulate a ton of dust and need a nice clean, too. As weird as it may sound, your dishwasher will also need a clean. While there is a self-cleaning option on most dishwashers, it's important to know that those aren't providing a deep clean, and you'll need to do one yourself pretty regularly. A wipe-down with vinegar and a soft scrub with baking soda should do the trick. And don't forget to polish the outside, too. Lastly, don't forget your drain. Whether you have a garbage disposal or not, it's a place we often miss while cleaning – even deep cleaning. Your kitchen sink drain could have a buildup of food, and it might be creating a terrible stench. Boiling water and baking soda are an easy fix.

The innovative construction of one of the United Kingdom's most booked Airbnbs apparently took just 10 days to complete. Architect Roderick James, 75, and his interior designer wife, Amanda Markham, designed and built the AirShip 002 in 2018, the British news agency SWNS reported. The ""remote, cozy, compact, aluminum-capsule structure"" looks like a futuristic air ship. It features floor-to-ceiling breathtaking Scottish Highland views, according to the same source. 3-D PRINTED TEXAS NEIGHBORHOOD IS GOING UP AS HOMES START IN MID-$400,000 RANGE: ‘TREMENDOUS INTEREST’ The £165 per night accommodation — about $205 U.S. dollars — in Drimnin, Scotland, was the most wish-listed Airbnb rental in the U.K. in 2020, SWNS reported. It is booked over a year in advance. The couple behind one of the U.K.'s most booked Airbnbs say the innovative construction of this tiny house only took 10 days to construct.  (SWNS) The couple built the project — part of their company Out of the Blue Ltd. — at a cost of £100K (or about $124,000 in U.S. dollars). Yet reportedly it's already made its money back ever since its creation five years ago. The couple behind the Airbnb live nearby in another house that they designed themselves called Eagle Rock. Roderick told SWNS, ""We designed the AirShip 002 just for fun at first. But then a perfect plot [of land] came up and we decided to build on it. At first, we weren't intending to [rent] it [out]. We just thought it would be an ideal location — but then it became incredibly popular.""

We wanted to build something that could be built anywhere and any part of the structure can be carried by two people."" He also said, ""It has over 3,000 components, which were computer-laser-cut in the factory, which took three to four months. But then the actual structure went up in 10 days on site.

What happens when you close a credit card?,"Mott Capital Management founder and CEO Michael Kramer provides his outlook for the markets. If there’s a credit card that you don’t want to keep anymore, an option is to close the credit card. ""Closing a credit card means you’re shutting down the account – you can’t use the card anymore,"" explained Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst, Bankrate.com. Even though the account is closed, Rossman said your payment history will remain on your credit report for up to 10 years, in the case of positive information, and it’s up to seven years for negative information. But, he cautioned some aspects of a person's credit score will be affected immediately. ""You’ll have less available credit, for example, which can cause your credit utilization ratio to spike,"" Rossman continued. ""That's the credit you’re using divided by the credit available to you."" During their appearance on 'Mornings with Maria,' MacroMavens President Stephanie Pomboy and Thornburg Investment President and CEO Jason Brady discuss inflation and the future for rate hikes. The most common way to close a credit card is by calling the card issuer’s customer service department. You can find the number on the back of your credit card. You might also be able to close the account online, in person (at a bank branch, for example) or in writing, Rossman said. INVESTORS ARE THE MOST BEARISH IN 5 MONTHS AS CREDIT CRUNCH HITS GROWTH There can be some advantages to shutting an account down. ""Closing a credit card might streamline your finances – for example, if you have a bunch of cards and you’re finding it difficult to stay on top of due dates, usage, rewards categories, etc.,"" said Rossman. Other suitable reasons to cancel a card could be that you aren’t reaping value from the credit card. ""You might also consider canceling a credit card if it charges an annual fee and you’re not taking full advantage of its benefits, or if the card charges a high interest rate or has rewards categories that don’t mesh well with your spending habits,"" Rossman told FOX Business. Mastercard credit cards. (Photo Illustration by Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images) Before you call your credit card issuer to put an end to that credit card, consider some disadvantages. ""Canceling a credit card can hurt your credit score, however, by reducing your available credit,"" cautioned Rossman. ""That can lead to a higher credit utilization ratio - credit you’re using divided by credit available to you. MORGAN STANLEY WARNS STOCK MARKET IS STILL 'FAR FROM OUT OF THE WOODS' Here’s how Rossman illustrated this point. Let’s say you have a credit card balance of $5,000 and a total credit limit of $10,000. If you cancel a card with a $3,000 limit, now you’re using $5,000 out of $7,000 (71%), up from 50% initially, said Rossman. ""The lower this ratio is, the better,"" he pointed out. And, rather than canceling a credit card, Rossman suggested requesting a product change from your issuer. ""This can represent the best of both worlds. You switch to a different card from the same issuer, allowing you to avoid credit score damage, such as a higher credit utilization ratio, but getting you into a product that suits you better,"" he continued.  This new card could offer more targeted rewards categories, a lower annual fee, a lower interest rate or other things, Rossman says. FOX Business host Charles Payne analyzes consumer spending on 'Making Money.' Yes, Rossman said all of your credit card account history should be reported to the credit bureaus: account openings, closings, payment history, credit utilization, etc. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Sara Rathner, a credit card expert at NerdWallet, told FOX Business that every credit card issuer has a system for evaluating card applications, and it can be a bit of a mystery. ""In general, a high credit score can help you be eligible for a greater variety of cards, but that’s not going to guarantee an approval every time,"" said Rathner. ""Other financial factors, like your income, current debts and other open lines of credit can affect your eligibility."" ",684,personal-finance
ExxonMobil unleashing 'much needed' affordable energy with industry’s biggest refinery expansion in 10 years,"ExxonMobil Senior Vice President of Global Operations Janet Matsushita tells Fox News Digital that its biggest oil expansion in 10 years is operating safely and reliably at full capacity. Near the Gulf Coast just east of Texas’ oil-rich Permian Basin, nearly 2,000 ExxonMobil contractors are making sure the company’s latest project – which includes 26 miles of piping, 35 miles of electrical wiring and 875 tons of steel – is pumping oil at full capacity. After launching America’s largest oil refinery expansion in over a decade, ExxonMobil’s senior vice president of global operations detailed how the company’s Beaumont complex is not only fueling U.S. energy supply but also the economy. ""When you put it all together and you look at this particular location, what I love about it, it allows us to buy what I consider to be very much needed, affordable energy, and in a very reliable supply to fuel the economy that we have here in Texas, the U.S. and, I say, across the globe,"" Janet Matsushita told Fox News Digital. After beginning construction in 2019, the Beaumont refinery startup broke ground just over one month ago and added 250,000 barrels per day to its oil output, increasing its total processing capacity to more than 630,000 barrels daily. To put things into perspective, this equates to a sizable 4 million gallons per day, providing enough fuel to power 61,000 long-haul trucks in a single day. CHEVRON, EXXON DEVELOPING CLEANER GAS AS ALTERNATIVE TO EVs The project's reported hefty $2 billion price tag was no match for Exxon, who completed the expansion on time and on budget, earning the facility two consecutive Gold Energy Star acknowledgments from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to Matsushita. ExxonMobil’s Beaumont refinery expansion adds 250,000 barrels per day to the oil company’s processing capacity. (Fox News) ""It is actually the equivalent of building a brand-new refinery. It is a big expansion, it is not a minor expansion,"" she said contently. ""When we built this project, we actually leveraged some of the best energy technology available so that when we operate this new project itself, it is one of the most energy-efficient versus industry standard."" ""And [what's] really nice to see, we're actually connected to the U.S. Permian crude,"" she continued, ""which is right here in our Texas backyard, and that is also a very energy-efficient operation in terms of how we perform. And it has an aspiration to actually be net-zero by 2030."" Prior to opening, the Beaumont expansion went through rigorous performance testing for safety and reliability, the VP of global operations explained. After 5 million working-person hours, ExxonMobil has reported no mishaps or injuries on site. The Schork Group Principal Stephen Schork argues Chevron and Exxon shifting their focus to oil projects in the Americas is an 'excellent sign.' ""I'm extremely pleased to say that the whole project right now is actually running at design capability, which really speaks to the quality not only of the project, but of the execution-operating team that we have here in Beaumont,"" Matsushita touted. In addition to now being one of the largest oil refineries in America, the Beaumont expansion also works towards ExxonMobil’s mission of creating sustainable solutions that improve quality of life and meet society's evolving needs. ""In 2022 post the pandemic, there was a significant demand for affordable energy to fuel the whole economic growth that was there,"" she said. ""ExxonMobil from a manufacturing perspective. We globally actually ran the most throughput that we have had since 2012. And here in the U.S., we actually hit our highest peak record production of 2.1 million barrels a day of capacity, which is something we feel good about."" ExxonMobil is boosting fuel supply in Beaumont, Texas, with America’s largest refinery expansion since 2021. (Fox News) And if it wasn't for the technology and engineering teams utilizing ""really brilliant"" 3-D imaging to create virtual models, training and planning for the expansion would not have run as smoothly, she said. ""We actually do move a lot of our best global teams and we implement that global best practice at each of the sites. And we actually brought that all together here in Beaumont to be able to make this project such a success,"" Matsushita said. ""The 3-D models, it allowed us to actually expedite our construction, so we knew exactly in all three dimensions what it would look like, and to compare it, train it, be ready for it. And now we have that available to us as we go forward from a sustainable maintenance perspective.""

"Americans spent more on legal cannabis in 2022 than chocolate, beer: report","Actor and comedian Cheech Marin shares why he launched his own cannabis company with longtime friend Tommy Chong and curated an exhibit of Chicano art on 'Kennedy.' U.S. residents are spending more money to purchase legal cannabis than they are on chocolate, craft beer and topical pain relief. A report from MJBizDaily showed Americans spent roughly $30 billion on legal marijuana in 2022 while only spending around $20 billion on chocolate. The cannabis purchases eclipsed sales of ""feel-good"" products, including beer, opioid medications and topical pain relief, the report stated. Though the legal purchase of marijuana is becoming increasingly popular, sales still fell behind the tobacco industry, which made around $53 billion last year despite a steady decline.

(Getty) According to the report, sales of legal cannabis could reach $57 billion by 2028. The figures come more than a decade after voters in Colorado and Washington approved ballot measures during the 2012 election to become the first U.S. states to legalize marijuana.

Even with increased legalization across the country, illegal marijuana sales remain far more common than legal ones, with Whitney Economics estimating that three-quarters of such sales in the U.S. still occur on the black market. Purchases of legal cannabis still fall behind tobacco product sales, which totaled about $53 billion last year.

During his ""My Take,"" Monday ""Varney & Co."" host Stuart Varney discussed the consequences of Democrats covering up the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, arguing the president's ""successful dirty trick"" helped win him the election, but put the United States in a ""disastrous"" foreign policy position. STUART VARNEY: It's October 2020, right before the monumental Trump versus Biden election. The final presidential debate is days away and the New York Post issues a blockbuster report on Hunter Biden's laptop. GOP LAWMAKER HINTS BIDEN IMPEACHMENT AS HUNTER SCANDAL DEEPENS: ‘HOW CAN WE NOT?’ It's a huge problem for the Biden team. Trump might use the revelations against their guy. What to do?

WASHINGTON, DC - Hunter Biden (L) and President Joe Biden  (Photo by Teresa Kroeger/Getty Images for World Food Program USA / Getty Images) Enter Antony Blinken. He's now the Secretary of State, but back then he was a Biden campaign advisor. He contacted the acting head of the CIA, Michael Morell. They orchestrated a letter from 51 intelligence professionals, saying the laptop story was ""Russian disinformation."" That was a lie and they knew it. HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP IS THE ‘TIP OF THE ICEBERG’: REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY Days later candidate Biden used the letter in the debate. It proved, he said, that what Trump is saying, ""is a bunch of garbage."" It wasn't garbage. The laptop held a sordid tale of financial corruption, which should have been revealed to voters.

LARRY KUDLOW: The rule of law is the bedrock of free market capitalism,"FOX Business host Larry Kudlow calls out the Biden administration for failing to uphold the rule of law in the U.S. on 'Kudlow.' Once again, this evening, we're going to talk about political interference with our legal system and, yes, what I regard as sleazy and dirty political tactics. This is a business show, but I think these legal issues are very important to business and free enterprise. Stay with me on this.  The rule of law is absolutely essential, a bedrock of free market capitalism. It's what makes the American system so successful and popular and reliable and hospitable to investors and entrepreneurs here at home and frankly all around the world.  Again, let me repeat: the rule of law, based on the American constitution going back 250 years, is the essential bedrock of free market capitalism. So, to me, any administration, I don't care, Republican or Democrat, that interferes with the rule of law is undermining our economy, our future prosperity and frankly confidence in our whole system. That is why a business show like ours needs to report on these matters. Now, I'm going to connect some dots. It is alleged that Attorney General Merrick Garland has deliberately slow-walked the Hunter Biden investigations and a whistleblower, who apparently is a senior guy, who is not political, who employs a lawyer who has represented a number of Democrats, has been denied legal protection by AG Merrick Garland. CONSERVATIVE COLLEGE GRAD WHO WALKED OUT OF MERRICK GARLAND'S COMMENCEMENT SPEECH 'WOULD DO IT AGAIN' Merrick Garland, U.S. attorney general, speaks during the U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Jan. 21, 2022.  (Photographer: Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Let me note, that this is an allegation, not yet an evidentiary fact. Further, the whistleblower is alleging that A.G. Garland refused Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss' request for special counsel protection and at least two Biden-appointed U.S. attorneys have not cooperated with Weiss because Garland has ordered them to slow-walk or maybe not walk at all.  That is the allegation. Numerous legal commentators have noted that Hunter Biden's allegations regarding tax evasion and federal firearm offenses are so straightforward that they should've been settled in 5 days, not 5 years, quoting former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy. Now, again, these are allegations, but they have the ring of truth (Don’t they?) and this whistleblower is going to have his day in court, when he testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee, which will give him proper immunity, but again, my point is Merrick Garland's undermining our legal system, our rule of law, weaponizing our legal system, politicizing our legal system. This is so sleazy. Literally, a dirty trick to protect the president's son and protect the president. Not only from full transparency, but from our entire legal system. If this sort of sleazy tactics continues, at some point nobody is going to want to invest in the U.S. We'll be like Latin America. We'll be like Western Europe. Or, if we let big government get even bigger and even more unlimited, interfering with our legal system, we'll be like the old Soviet Union, or today's Venezuela, or even the Chinese Communist Party. We talk a lot about the economic impact of taxes, regulations, government spending and money printing. It's all terribly important -- for confidence and for economic prosperity, but the dependable rule of law is probably more important than any of those economic policies. Literally, it's what makes America great. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., gives his take on the Biden family's questionable business dealings on 'Kudlow.' Congressman Jim Jordan in his Judiciary hearings has unearthed a dirty-tricks operation led by current Secretary of State Antony Blinken during the 2020 campaign to protect Joe Biden in the second debate and later. Blinken and former deputy CIA director Mike Morell and their gang of 51 spies is a despicable political dirty trick. Blinken should not be in his position, but how different are the actions of A.G. Merrick Garland? Isn't his slow-walking another political dirty trick? Doesn't it undermine the rule of law and the Constitution itself and a million future investment decisions that will bypass America because our legal system looks to be unreliable? Hence economic damage? Hence undermining economic prosperity?  That's why a business reporter has to cover these stories. Save America. Protect our legal system.

AI chatbots could be impacted by Supreme Court's ruling in Section 230 case,"Strat Americas Managing Director Seth Schachner discusses the potential threat artificial intelligence-generated music could have on the industry and how the change could be helpful instead of harmful. The Supreme Court is expected to release a decision in the next few months in a case that concerns a liability shield for internet and social media companies that could impact chatbots using artificial intelligence (AI) like ChatGPT. At issue in the case is whether tech platforms like YouTube, which is owned by Google, violate the liability shield under federal law that applies to user-generated, third-party content when they use algorithms to recommend content to users through suggestions on the platform or send notifications to such content. Generative AI chatbots operate using similar algorithms to refer users to content in response to queries or to take information from multiple sources and summarize it for users. That could expose the companies behind those AI-informed chatbots to liability depending on how the Supreme Court rules on the matter. Cameron Kerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank and an expert in AI, told Reuters, ""The debate is really about whether the organization of information available online through recommendation engines is so significant to shaping the content so as to become liable. You have the same kinds of issues with respect to a chatbot."" GOOGLE UNVEILS NEW BARD AI CAPABILITIES FOR CODING The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in the next few months in a case related to Section 230 liability protections for tech firms that could impact AI chatbots. (AP Photo / J. Scott Applewhite / File / AP Newsroom) While the case at issue before the Supreme Court doesn’t directly relate to artificial intelligence, a ruling could revise or upend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act – a landmark law from 1996 that helped shape the modern internet. In practice, tech companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter are generally immune from liability for content posted on their platforms by users under Section 230, although they’re required to remove content that’s prohibited by federal law such as material infringing on copyrights or violating sex trafficking laws. Justice Neil Gorsuch noted during oral arguments that AI programs can already create new content and tools to generate ""poetry"" and ""polemics"" that go ""beyond picking, choosing, analyzing, or digesting content,"" so such content wouldn’t be protected under Section 230. THESE JOBS ARE SAFE FROM THE AI REVOLUTION – FOR NOW An iPhone screen displays the Google Bard generative AI language model (chatbot). (Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images / File / Getty Images) Gorsuch discussed a standard developed by the Ninth Circuit for the purpose of evaluating whether the content is protected under Section 230 as the ""neutral tools test"" – which assesses whether a tool like a search engine filters content only by user-generated criteria. In posing a question to one of the attorneys, he said the court ""could say the Ninth Circuit’s Neutral Tools test was mistaken because, in some circumstances, even neutral tools, like algorithms, can generate through artificial intelligence forms of content and that the Ninth Circuit wasn’t sensitive to that possibility."" AI chatbots often paraphrase existing information in responses to users – an action that would be protected under Section 230. But in some cases, AI chatbots have given users responses that appear to have been fabricated by the bot itself, which would likely fall outside the protections of Section 230 as it becomes original content. Depending on the nature of the content created by the AI chatbot, that could expose its creator to legal liability. GERMAN AUTHORS, PERFORMERS CALL FOR TOUGHER CHATGPT RULES AMID COPYRIGHT CONCERNS Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told Reuters that AI developers should be liable for the shortcoming of models they ""programmed, trained and deployed."" Farid added, ""When companies are held responsible in civil litigation for harms from the products they produce, they produce safer products. And when they’re not held liable, they produce less safe products."" A sign with logos for Google and YouTube are shown outside the Googleplex corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California, April 14, 2018.

Google that involves a lawsuit filed against Google by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed at the age of 23 in an ISIS terror attack in Paris more than seven years ago. The suit alleges that the algorithm used by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, helped ISIS recruit and incite violence because the platform’s recommendation algorithm featured extremist videos based on viewers’ interests and sent users notifications to the controversial videos.

"Fake remote and hybrid jobs are being shared online, TikTok users claim: 'Way to trick candidates'","Check out what's clicking on FoxBusiness.com Some job seekers who are looking for fully remote or hybrid jobs say they’re coming across opportunities that claim to be work-from-home-friendly, but will later hear from recruiters who end up revealing otherwise. The alleged bait-and-switch tactic has become a topic of discussion on social media, including on TikTok, where jobseekers have been sharing their experiences with surprise job terms and misleading job postings. On April 18, Jamie Jackson, 41, of Nashville, Tennessee, uploaded a video of an apparent mislabeled job posting to her TikTok account @humorousresources where she calls out job postings on popular career websites. 6 REMOTE JOB INTERVIEW TIPS FROM KNOWLEDGEABLE CAREER EXPERTS The role that caught Jackson’s eye was an administrative assistant job in Lake Worth, Florida, which is labeled as a ""remote"" and ""WFH"" (short for work-from-home) opportunity, but the job posting goes on to say that it’s actually not a remote position. Jamie Jackson, a TikTok content creator who runs the account ""Humorous Resources,"" says she suspects that recruiters and hiring managers could be intentionally labeling non-remote jobs as being remote- and hybrid-friendly. (Jamie Jackson/iStock / Fox News) ""Administrative assistant. Remote. Work-from-home."" Jackson read aloud in her TikTok video as she goes over the role that’s been shared to LinkedIn by a third-party recruiting company called Get.It Recruit - Administrative. ""What’s that down there in the yellow?"" Jackson continued as she called out the posting’s text, which she highlighted with a digital yellow marker. ""If you are looking for a remote position, please do not apply."" The job posting reads, to which Jackson replied. ""Why don’t you proofread? Proofread your postings."" FOX Business reached out to Get.It Recruit - Administrative for comment. WORKING FROM HOME COST EMPLOYEES MONEY BUT 35% WANT TO CONTINUE IT FULL-TIME In a TikTok direct message, Jackson wrote that she’s suspicious of job postings that have remote and work-from-home labels that are contradicted in job descriptions. ""I do not think it’s a proofreading mistake,"" she wrote. ""I believe it’s more a way to trick candidates into applying. Thinking candidates won’t read the fine details of the job posting."" TikTok users who are actively looking for a remote or hybrid job claim they've seen and have applied to opportunities that end up requiring in-person work. (iStock / iStock) Commenters under Jackson's TikTok post have shared that they’re also skeptical that human error is involved with mislabeled job postings. ""They do this on purpose to get attention.

""Done on purpose, just like one salary range in the header and then some nonsense about how that won’t be the salary in the meat of the listing,"" another TikTok user noted. ""Are recruiters trying to boost their ‘leads’ metrics? Tell their boss they have 30 phone calls with prospective candidates?"" one TikTok user questioned. Jobseekers who are searching for remote and hybrid work opportunities say they've been disappointed to learn that jobs they've applied for are actually looking for in-person workers, which has made them feel misled.

""One person said, ‘That was a mistake on our part. Really sorry to waste your time. I’m going to repost that and make sure it doesn't say work-from-home anymore,’"" the TikTok user recalled. ""She reposted the next day, and it still said work-from-home."" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The TikTok user who replied to Jackson theorized that companies are intentionally mislabeling job postings in order to get a larger pool of qualified candidates. Having more candidates to choose from could improve a recruitment service’s or hiring manager’s chance of finding someone to cave and accept a full-time in-person job, she concluded. Clarify Capital, a New York City-based financial consulting firm, released a survey in the fall of 2022 that consulted 1,045 hiring managers on ""ghost jobs,"" also known as job postings that have been uploaded, but aren’t actively being filled. Workplaces around the world use recruiting software is to sort through online job candidates.

Shares for First Republic Bank dropped in after-hours trading following the San Francisco-based regional bank’s first-quarter earnings report, which revealed the bank’s deposits dropped 40% amid the crisis that enveloped regional lenders following Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) collapse. First Republic reported that its deposits totaled $104.5 billion at the end of March – down 35.5% year over year and a drop of 40.8% compared to Dec. 31, 2022. That figure includes the infusion of $30 billion in uninsured deposits from 11 of the largest U.S. banks that were provided to stabilize the bank amid the crisis in March. First Republic shares dropped in after-hours trading following the release of its first-quarter results, falling as much as 20% before rebounding to about a 17% decline as of 5:30 p.m. Eastern.

Its implosion fueled concerns about other regional lenders, including First Republic, which prompted the deposit flight and steps to shore up its financial position.

Bud Light rivals stealing sales after Dylan Mulvaney controversy,"Former Levi’s brand president Jennifer Sey discusses Budweiser’s patriotic ad release after Dylan Mulvaney partnership controversy on 'The Bottom Line.’ Amid ongoing consumer backlash to the Dylan Mulvaney marketing campaign, Bud Light’s dollar share for the latest week lost almost the same amount as competitors like Miller Lite and Coors Light gained, according to a report from Beer Business Daily. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 13: Dylan Mulvaney attends her Day 365 Live! at The Rainbow Room on March 13, 2023 in New York City.  ((Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) / Getty Images) Data compiled for the week showed Coors Light and Miller Lite’s dollar share went up 3.5% and 3.1% respectively, suggesting Bud Light’s losses in dollar share resulted directly from consumer recoil rather than a lapse in beer demand, the report continued. BUD LIGHT MARKETING VP TAKES LEAVE OF ABSENCE IN WAKE OF DYLAN MULVANEY BACKLASH: REPORT Over the same period, Coors Light cases went up 10.6% and Miller Lite jumped 11.5%.

BUD LIGHT LOST MOST SALES IN DEMOCRAT-LED STATES: HARRY SCHUHMACHER As the backlash unfolds, some restaurant chains have come out vocally against the Bud Light, Dylan Mulvaney marketing campaign, while the company's Twitter account has been largely silent, tweeting just twice in April with the latest coming 10 days ago on April 14. Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Bud Light, has recently been accused of discriminatory practices related to a program aimed at providing opportunities to minorities and women. America First Legal, a conservative legal group set up by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has since filed a federal civil rights complaint against the brewing company with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. BUD LIGHT BACKLASH COULD HIT BEER SUPPLIERS On April 17, Beer Business Daily publisher Harry Schuhmacher told FOX Business Bud Light suffered the worst sales in blue states, due to the campaign not hitting with the younger generation of beer drinkers.

Comité Champagne, a professional organization that represents champagne growers, producers, merchants, traders and cooperatives in Champagne, the historic wine region of France, reached out to Belgian customs officials to destroy the confiscated beer shipment. In a press release issued on Tuesday, April 18, the champagne committee announced the General Administration of Belgian Customs followed through on the request and destroyed 2,352 cans of Miller High Life, which were bound for Germany.

""It is disingenuous for some American producers to use the Champagne name when their product is not from the region,"" the bureau continued.

National security expert warns there's likely more Chinese influence stations than what's been discovered,"America First Policy Institute senior fellow Steve Yates discusses the impact of Chinese influence in Sudan amid violent conflict. As the FBI and watchdog groups raise red flags around communist China influence centers based across America, one national security expert sounded alarms that the number of undercover police stations is likely to rise. ""I suspect that number of six is actually low, that all these community centers have been dual-use because the Communist Party ethnically targets its own citizens and friends and family,"" America First Policy Institute senior fellow Steve Yates said on ""Mornings with Maria"" Monday. ""They are the biggest racists in going after people to try to make them work for their politics."" Following the arrest of two New York City residents who were allegedly running secret ""police stations"" on behalf of Beijing, the New York Post reported last week that there are at least six more stations on U.S. soil in places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Nebraska and Minnesota, according to a Madrid-based human rights group.

""An official with the Chinese National Police directed one of the defendants – a U.S. citizen who worked at the secret police station – to help locate a pro-democracy activist of Chinese descent living in California.

"US Navy to use unmanned, AI-driven ships to counter smuggling, illegal fishing","Builder.ai founder Sachin Dev Duggal calls for proper regulation, understanding and control around the use of artificial intelligence. The U.S. Navy is planning to expand its use of unmanned ships using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by deploying drone ships in the waters around Central and South America to counter smuggling operations along with illegal fishing by China. The Navy launched a drone ship initiative known as Task Force 59 in late 2021 in the 5th Fleet area, which includes much of the Middle East and several critical maritime chokepoints where the U.S. and partner countries have sought to counter piracy and smuggling. Earlier this month, the Navy announced it will move forward this year with a similar plan to deploy unmanned ships to the 4th Fleet, which has an area of responsibility covering the waters off both coasts of Central and South America and extends to Antarctica. ""The 4th Fleet area of operations provides us with an environment best suited to operationalize the concepts that Task Force 59 has worked tirelessly to develop to increase our maritime domain awareness or MDA capabilities,"" Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said at a Navy League luncheon earlier this month. ""The MDA technologies and platforms we are bringing to the region will address several significant challenges,"" Del Toro explained. ""These include narcotics and human trafficking, as well as economic and ecological harm caused by illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which the People’s Republic of China, through their distant water fishing fleets, participates in on both the Pacific Coast and the Atlantic Coast of Central and South America.""

During the bilateral exercise between the United States and United Kin (U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Roland Franklin / DVIDS) Unmanned, AI-driven vessels are expected to make up a larger portion of the Navy’s fleet in the years ahead. In the Navy’s latest force structure and shipbuilding plan released last week, the service estimated that the service could have between 89 and 149 unmanned vessels by 2045 compared to between 323 and 365 manned ships. The use of unmanned drones that are driven by AI and utilize machine learning to analyze the vast quantities of data they obtain not only allows the Navy to sustain its surveillance of key waterways for longer periods of time but also frees up manned vessels for other tasks.

AI and other technologies will help the service process that information and respond to it. ""So we think that we can leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities with that information, that’s supplemented by the data that we pull in from unmanned platforms, to give us a much better common operational picture,"" Gilday said. ""But perhaps leveraging AI to be much more predictive in terms of where that traffic’s coming from, to be much more effective in terms of intercepting it.""

Gilday emphasized that it will be an ""iterative process"" to bring more unmanned vessels into the fleet and that leaders are thinking ""minimally manned before we go fully autonomous.""

The 60-40 investment strategy back after tanking last year,"A 'Mornings with Maria' Word on Wall Street panel discusses the earnings season outlook, recession possibilities and rising price pressures on oil. The classic 60-40 investment strategy is working again after a disastrous 2022. Americans planning for retirement have been advised for decades to diversify their holdings between stocks and bonds. It was a dependable way of investing that worked for millions of people. Last year’s tandem declines in stocks and bonds blindsided many of the strategy’s followers who were counting on bonds to help cushion their portfolios when equities had a bad year. Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (AP Photo/Seth Wenig / AP Images) The Federal Reserve’s aggressive bid to raise interest rates to tame inflation rattled everything from stocks and bonds to oil and bitcoin. Yet by the end of last year, the clouds began to part. Stocks rallied alongside bonds, boosted by hopes that the Fed was nearing an end to its tightening campaign. WHAT FACTORS SHOULD DRIVE YOUR ETF INVESTMENT DIRECTIVES FOR 2023? A portfolio with 60% of its money invested in U.S. stocks and 40% in the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate bond index has gained 5.9% in 2023 as of Monday, according to Dow Jones Market Data, building on a 5.3% advance in the fourth quarter. Last year, the portfolio fell 16%, its worst year since 2008. The recovery has emboldened individual investors who didn’t stray from the 60-40 investment mix during last year’s turmoil. Scott Owen, a 74-year-old retiree living in Ponte Vedra, Fla., said he briefly considered paring his stock exposure last year but ultimately opted not to. The former mechanical engineer sold shares at a loss during the 2008 financial crisis and missed out on the market’s rebound by waiting more than two years on the sidelines. He didn’t want to repeat the mistake. ""That probably cost me a lot of money,"" Mr. Owen said. ""At that time, I panicked—I didn’t know where the market was going."" ETFS AND YOUR PORTFOLIO: EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON WHAT PERCENTAGE TO OWN For decades, investors have relied on the 60-40 investment mix to generate stable returns, earning an average 9.3% annually through the end of 2022, according to DJMD, which reviewed data going back 35 years. An investor who put $10,000 in a 60-40 portfolio in 1988 would have a principal worth more than $180,000 now, after accounting for an annual rebalance. A trader looks at his screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange June 29, 2010. (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS) (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid / Reuters Photos) Behind 60-40’s success? The S&P 500 tends to rebound after steep declines and investors who buy the dip are often richly rewarded. The benchmark stock index has gained 7.5% this year, including dividends, and bonds have clawed back some of their value. Bonds helped offset some of the pain of the previous market crises, including the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the short-lived market panic brought by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. That didn’t happen in 2022. An index that largely holds Treasurys, highly rated corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities fell 13%, posting its worst year on record, while the S&P 500 declined 18%. Individual investors close to retirement were the hardest hit because their portfolios didn’t have time to recover from the losses. Mark Teister, a 66-year-old retiree in Glenview, Ill., says he switched to a more conservative investment approach from a traditional 60-40 strategy in late 2021. He bought funds holding dividend-paying companies and value stocks, along with securities that mitigate the risk of higher bond yields. If the market stabilizes, he hopes to revert to the 60-40 mix. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, March 20, 2023. Last year's stock market volotaility has many investors hunting for safer investment strategies. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Get (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) ""I’ve got to have something that protects me from doing something stupid,"" said Mr. Teister, who used to work as an executive at a coffee company. Of course, there is no guarantee that the 60-40 strategy will keep working, and the market’s trajectory is especially difficult to predict. The economy is still humming along, inflation remains hot and the banking crisis that erupted in March appears to be contained—all of which could propel the Fed to keep raising rates. Plus, stocks remain expensive historically, and strategists warn that valuations will likely be crunched in the event of a recession. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.2 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, down from 21.6 at the start of 2022 but above the 10-year average of 17.5. Investors have pared their stock exposure in light of the recent tumult in markets. Goldman Sachs expects households to be net sellers of $750 billion of equities this year, with investors instead piling into yield-bearing assets such as money-market funds and bonds. That is a stark contrast from the start of 2020 through mid-2022, when they were net buyers of $1.7 trillion in equities. Households own almost 40% of the total U.S. equity market, making them important drivers of financial markets. Meanwhile, a March survey from the American Association of Individual Investors found that investors have increased their bond exposure to the highest level since 2021, while their stock exposure has ticked down but remains above historical averages. The respondents had about 65% of their portfolios in stocks, 15% in bonds and 20% in cash. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP Still, Todd Schlanger, a senior investment strategist at Vanguard, said he expects the 60-40 strategy to work well for the next decade, pointing to lower stock valuations and attractive bond yields. Mr. Schlanger forecasts the annualized 10-year median return for a globally diversified 60-40 strategy at 5.4%. ""60-40 is used as a bellwether,"" Mr. Schlanger said. ""That strategy we believe is an enduring one."" Leslie Hollon, 68, retired in 2022 as a pastor in San Antonio. His 60-40-style portfolio fell about 15% last year, prompting him to withdraw less money to put toward his living expenses. Despite the declines, Dr. Hollon said he is confident in his investing approach and expects bonds to make a comeback this year. ""It was encouraging that there’s resilience in 60-40, and the resiliency was showing in still a very tumultuous market,"" said Mr. Hollon, who hopes to continue using his retirement funds to travel with his wife.

"Airbnb host hit with $640 utility bill after guests purposely leave gas, water on: Report","Check out what's clicking on FoxBusiness.com An Airbnb host in South Korea was reportedly hit with a $640 utility bill after his guests intentionally left the gas on and drove up the water usage. The host, identified as Lee, said a man and woman booked the home in Mapo-gu, Seoul, on Airbnb for a long-term stay of upward of one month, according to the English translation of a report from SBS. During their stay, Lee received a call from a meter inspector warning him that there may be a gas leak inside the home, according to the report. AIRBNB SEES 30% MORE NIGHTS BOOKED FOR THE SUMMER TRAVEL COMPARED TO PRE-PANDEMIC When Lee checked on the residence, he discovered a lit fire and a hot floor. The windows were left open and there were no guests inside the home, according to the report.

(Thiago Prudencio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images / Getty Images) Due to the high gas usage, Lee was hit with a charge of 640,000 won, according to SBS. That is equivalent to over $480. The couple also used 120 metric tons of water which added another nearly 170,000 won to his bill. That's another nearly $130 charge. AIRBNB CEO PREDICTS GUESTS WILL STAY 'WEEKS, MONTHS, OR EVEN ENTIRE SEASONS AT A TIME' Seoul's water authority said that water usage is equivalent to the amount that eight adults would use in a two-month span, the outlet reported. Lee claimed the couple ran up the bills on purpose because he refused to accept their last-minute cancelation request. According to the report, a few days before the reservation, the guests tried to cancel claiming they were infected with COVID-19. Lee refused to accept their request unless they had proof, according to the report. The guests decided to move ahead with their stay. Eventually, Lee started noticing their unusual behavior through his security cameras.

NASA CAPTURES PHOTO OF 'BEAR'S FACE' ON THE SURFACE OF MARS Scientists hope that by studying where and when clouds form on Mars, they will get a better understanding about the composition of the planet’s atmosphere, including the temperatures and winds within it. A cloud survey conducted in 2021 included images from the black-and-white navigation cameras and provided a look at the structure of clouds as they moved. NASA's Curiosity rover captured images of cirrus clouds on July 17, 2017.

""By looking at color transitions, we’re seeing particle size changing across the cloud. That tells us about the way the cloud is evolving and how its particles are changing size over time."" The Curiosity rover was launched on Nov. 26, 2011 and landed on Mars on Aug. 5, 2012. Its mission was to find out whether Mars ever had the right environmental conditions to support life, and early on, the rover discovered chemical and mineral evidence habitable environments from the past.

NASA's James Webb Space Telescope captures spectacular image of ultra-bright merging galaxies,"Four volunteers will live in NASA's Mars habitat for one year, helping the space center collect data for its first mission to the planet in outer space. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured a stunning photo of two galaxies merging galaxies some 700 million years in the making. Arp 220, the collective smash-up of two galaxies, is an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy with a luminosity of more than a trillion suns. For reference, the Milky Way galaxy has a luminosity of a mere 10 billion suns. A stunning smash-up of two spiral galaxies shines in infrared with the light of more than a trillion suns. (nasa.gov) Located 250 million light-years away in a constellation of Serpens, the name ""Arp 220"" derives its name from being the 220th object in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies, which was produced by the astronomer Halton Arp in 1966. NASA said the two galaxies began colliding around 700 millions years ago, sparking an enormous burst of star formation. Some 200 huge star clusters reside in a packed, dusty region roughly 5,000 light-years across – or 5% of the Milky Way’s diameter. The amount of gas in this region is equal to all the gas in the entire Milky Way. LYRID METEOR SHOWER: WHEN IT PEAKS AND HOW TO WATCH IT Webb viewed Arp 220 – which glows brightest in infrared – with its Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Prior radio telescope observations revealed around 100 supernova remnants in an area less than 500 light-years, NASA said. The Hubble Space Telescope was able to uncover the cores of parent galaxies around 1,200 light-years apart. In each of the cores was a rotating, star-forming ring blasting out infrared light that created diffraction spikes – the starburst feature that dominates the image, NASA said. The latest image includes significantly more detail than a 2008 photo of Arp 220.

"Flesh-eating bacteria infections may rise as climate warms, study finds","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A recent study suggests that the warming climate may increase infections from a flesh-eating bacterium along the coast of the eastern United States. The study, published in Scientific Reports on March 23, examined how climate change may affect the spread of Vibrio vulnificus, a bacterium that usually lives in warm, brackish seawater, farther north up the East Coast. ""Greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are changing our climate, and the impacts may be especially acute on the world's coastlines, which provide a major boundary between natural ecosystems and human populations and are an important source of human disease,"" geoscientist Elizabeth Archer said in the study. Archer and her colleagues used data models to predict the future disease distribution.

Its peak – which the agency notes is uncertain – has varied in past years, with the rate of meteors per hour also changing. The average peak rate is about 18 visible meteors per hour, but has shown higher rates of up to about 23 meteors per hour.

The Lyrids – one of the oldest known meteor showers – appear to radiate from near the constellation Lyra. Known for their fast and bright meteors, the Lyrids can produce the occasional fireball. Meteors come from leftover comet particles and bits from broken asteroids. When the comets move around the sun, they leave behind a dusty debris trail. Every year, the Earth passes through these trails, allowing the leftovers to collide with its atmosphere, creating streaks in the sky as they disintegrate.

"Scientists find concerning bird flu mutations, but US health officials say threat to humans is low","Lydia Wardle, JINYA Ramen Bar supply chain vice president, lays out the issues behind the egg shortage and the far-reaching costs on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ Although a man in Chile has been infected with a bird flu that has concerning mutations, the threat to humans remains low, according to U.S. health officials. Authorities said Friday that past animal studies suggest mutations could cause the virus to be more harmful or spread more easily, but that there is no evidence the mutations would make it easier for the virus to take root in a person's upper lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vivien Dugen said the mutations do not alter the assessment of the overall risk to people from H5N1, which ""continues to be low."" The agency's officials said the mutations may have occurred after the man was sickened. GRIZZLY BEARS, SKUNKS AMONG A DOZEN MAMMALS INFECTED WITH AVIAN INFLUENZA IN MONTANA New lab analysis examined the virus in the lungs of a 53-year-old man in the country's Antofagasta region. A World Health Organization summary of the case said he may have become infected through contact with sick or dead birds, or infected sea lions. The man had been healthy and had not traveled recently, but he started getting a cough, a sore throat and hoarseness on March 13. His symptoms worsened, and he was sent to an intensive care unit and treated with antiviral medicines and antibiotics.

But U.S. health officials said Friday, April 14, 2023, that the threat to humans remains low.  (AP Photo/Guadalupe Pardo, File) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the patient is still hospitalized and being monitored. Genetic sequencing this week revealed the two concerning mutations and Chilean and American health officials have been working together on the investigation. The case was the second human H5N1 bird flu virus infection reported in South America and the 11th globally since January 2022. In the U.S., one H5N1 case was reported last year in a person who reported fatigue without any other symptoms after poultry-culling activities. The mutations have appeared only in one hospitalized patient, and there is no evidence that the mutated virus has spread to others, mixed with other flu viruses or developed the ability to fight off current medicines or evade vaccines, they added.

""We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people."" Such changes have been witnessed in past bird flu infections. More than 450 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The majority of humans who have been infected have gotten it directly from birds. In the U.S., bird flu has recently been found in wild birds in every state, in addition to in commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks.

NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spots runaway black hole creating ‘trail of stars’,"During an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"", Jimmy Failla shares his thoughts on NASA announcing it is hiring two diversity champions. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has accidentally captured images of a ""runaway"" black hole barreling through space, leaving behind a contrail of newborn stars. The black hole, weighing as much as 20 million suns, is traveling through space so fast that if it were in our solar system, it could travel from Earth to the Moon in 14 minutes, according to NASA. An artist's impression of a runaway supermassive black hole.  (NASA) The 200,000-light-year ""contrail"" of stars that the black hole is leaving behind is approximately twice the diameter of the Milky Way. NASA said the phenomenon is likely the result of a game of ""galactic billiards among three massive black holes. The new stars are forming as the black hole is plowing into the gas in front of it to trigger new formations along a narrow corridor. NASA said the sighting is unprecedented. ""What we’re seeing is the aftermath. Like the wake of a ship we’re seeing the wake behind the black hole,"" Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, said in a statement. ""The trail must have lots of new stars, given that it is almost half as bright as the host galaxy it is linked to."" TOWNS UNDER 2024 SOLAR ECLIPSE'S PATH OF TOTALITY BEGIN PREPARING FOR RARE EVENT Van Dokkum said it was ""pure serendipity"" that researchers stumbled across the finding. According to NASA, van Dokkum was looking for globular star clusters in a nearby dwarf galaxy. ""I was just scanning through the Hubble image and then I noticed that we have a little streak. I immediately thought, 'oh, a cosmic ray hitting the camera detector and causing a linear imaging artifact,’"" van Dokkum said. ""When we eliminated cosmic rays we realized it was still there. It didn't look like anything we've seen before."" Spectroscopic observations reveal it is a 200,000-light-year-long chain of young blue stars.  (NASA) Van Dokkum investigated further and concluded that they were looking at the aftermath of a black hole flying through a halo of gas surrounding the host galaxy.

Former Ohio Gov. Bob Taft weighs in on hot-button constitutional amendment reform plan,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Former Republican Ohio Gov. Bob Taft urged state lawmakers on Monday against advancing a measure that would make it harder to amend the state constitution or reviving August special elections to do it — calling the combination ""especially bad public policy."" Taft, the scion of one of Ohio's most famous political families, sent a letter of protest to General Assembly members as a faction of GOP legislators and a coalition of powerful lobbyists scramble to get ahead of an amendment guaranteeing Ohioans' access to abortion that organizers hope to get on the November ballot. The Ohio Senate approved a resolution last week that would raise the threshold for citizens to pass future changes to the Ohio Constitution from 50%-plus-one to 60%, but the measure's fate in the politically fractured Ohio House has not yet been determined. OHIO REPUBLICANS PUSH TO RESTRICT CHANGES TO STATE'S CONSTITUTION AS ABORTION RIGHTS REMAIN A QUESTION A plan devised by Republican Senate President Matt Huffman and supported by Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose involves setting a special August election to put the 60% question before voters. The move comes only a few months after lawmakers passed legislation abolishing such elections in most cases. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed that bill in January, said on Monday that he would sign a bill to reverse it, should it clear both legislative chambers. Taft, who served as both governor and Ohio secretary of state, said he knows from running Ohio elections that few voters show up at the polls in the summer. Former Ohio Gov. Bob Taft has urged against fellow Republicans' plan to raise the public vote share threshold to 60% in order to pass new amendments to the Buckeye State's constitution. (Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""For more than 100 years, amendments to the Ohio Constitution have been decided by a simple majority vote,"" he wrote. ""The decision to change such a deeply embedded practice should not be made at a low turnout election."" He said such a question belongs on a general election ballot, when there is maximum turnout. But Taft said he also opposes raising the threshold for passing future constitutional amendments at all. Taft noted that two of his own signature initiatives as governor — the Clean Ohio Fund and the Third Frontier Project — would not have been approved under the higher threshold. The former passed with 57.4% of the vote, the latter — after an initial defeat — with 54.1%, he wrote. OHIO LAWMAKER MOVES TO FORCE VOTE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT RULES ""Both measures have stood the test of time, contributing importantly to the economy and quality of life of our state,"" Taft wrote. Taft, governor from 1999 to 2007, also warned that Ohio can't raise its debt limit above $750,000 without a vote of the people. Raising the threshold to 60% could mean that raising the debt limit to fund highway or school construction, environmental protection or job creation programs ""may become impossible in the years to come,"" he wrote. A similar argument was made in January by a coalition of voting rights, faith, labor and other organizations lined up to fight the measure. But Taft's last-minute opposition may do little to deter the 60% measure from moving forward, possibly as soon as this week. Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis said the necessary 60 representatives have committed to voting yes, and that list has been shared with Stephens. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gonidakis let lawmakers know that their votes on the resolution, as well as the bill setting a special August election, will be counted toward their ""pro-life"" records when scorecards are issued at election time, he said. The Buckeye Firearms Association, which supports raising the threshold to 60% to keep Ohioans from passing future gun control amendments, will use the same approach on its gun rights scorecards, Gonidakis said.

"Panel of Democrats, environmental activists blame climate change for whale deaths","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Climate change, spurred by the burning of fossil fuels, is the biggest danger to marine life including whales, a panel of Democratic officials and environmental groups said Monday. The gathering, held in an oceanfront conference room as a half-dozen dolphins frolicked in the ocean behind them, also strongly criticized a bill in the House of Representatives containing numerous incentives for oil and gas companies, and which eliminates several environmental protections currently in effect. It also was a retort to opponents of offshore wind development, who claim that preparation for wind farms off New Jersey and New York are killing whales along the U.S. East Coast. Numerous federal and state agencies say there is no evidence that the deaths are related to offshore wind survey work. MYSTERY OVER WHALE DEATHS SPARKS ALARM: WE NEED TO 'PAUSE AND INVESTIGATE' The event came a week after U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. and other New Jersey Congressional Democrats wrote to the White House Council on Environmental Quality ""demanding real solutions in response to the death of marine mammals off New Jersey’s coast."" But the letter did not seek pause in offshore wind projects as many Republicans demand. Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, two Republican Congressmen from New Jersey, want the work stopped at least temporarily. Neither responded to a request for comment Monday. No Republican elected officials were at Monday's event. Earlier this month, Republican New Jersey state senators Declan O’Scanlon and Ed Durr introduced a resolution calling on the federal and state governments to enact a moratorium on offshore wind preparation, saying ""We cannot ignore the surge in marine life deaths that has occurred while offshore wind project preparation activities have been conducted along the coast."" At Monday's event, Pallone said, ""The science has not linked the whale deaths to offshore wind activities. Climate change is the biggest threat to marine mammals."" Pallone and others said that as water temperatures rise, fish species that whales prey upon have been moving into different areas, bringing whales more frequently into the path of heavily traveled shipping lanes off the East Coast. A panel of environmental activists and Democrat politicians on Monday denied offshore renewable energy projects' potential effects on a recent uptick in whale deaths and beachings off the Atlantic Coast. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry) Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, said the migrating bait fish are ""bringing marine life into direct contact with the shipping superhighway that sits off our coast."" As Ed Potosnak of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters put it, ""They're having a picnic in the Parkway; they're getting hit."" Of the 32 whales that have died off the East Coast since Dec. 1, many have shown signs of being struck by ships or being entangled in discarded fishing gear, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month after a speech at Monmouth University, NOAA's administrator, Richard Spinrad, said ship strikes are a common cause of recent whale deaths. ""We study the fisheries, where the fish are, what the populations are, and there is some thought as to the whales following a change, a shift in where the prey is that the whales feed on, which may be a consequence of a change in the ocean itself,"" Spinrad said. ""By moving further inshore these whales are then more vulnerable to things like ship strikes. The science that we have conducted suggests there is not a link between the activities of offshore wind and the strandings we've seen along the East Coast."" U.S. Sen Cory Booker said burning fossil fuels ""is causing our house to be on fire, and we have been supplying the matches."" NOAA REPORT SAYS NEW JERSEY TURBINES MAY 'ADVERSELY AFFECT' WHALES, BUT DENIES LETHALITY Capt. Paul Eidman, of the group Anglers for Offshore Wind Power, said climate change is already affecting commercial and recreational fishing by changing where bait fish — and their predators — travel. ""Offshore wind energy offers a clean, economical, beneficial opportunity to combat the climate crisis and an alternative to continuing to burn fossil fuels,"" he said. ""We cannot ignore the fact that the impacts of climate change are disrupting species migration and holding patterns, posing serious risks to the long-term future of recreational fishing and the species we rely on."" Panelists sharply criticized HR1, a bill being pushed by House Republicans to lower energy costs by giving incentives to fossil fuel industries, rolling back many environmental laws and protections, and limiting the power of a president or government agency to limit or prevent energy projects on federal land.

"Portland, Maine's 'Valentine's Day Bandit' identified after dying at 67","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The identity of the so-called Valentine’s Day bandit, responsible for leaving hundreds of red hearts in downtown Portland for more than four decades, has been revealed in death. Kevin Fahrman, of Falmouth, was chief instigator of a group of feel-good pranksters who struck every year on Feb. 14, family and friends said, a tradition that put smiles on people’s faces while leaving behind an enduring mystery of who was responsible. He was 67 when he died late Thursday. Portland Mayor Kate Snyder said it was sad to lose such a local treasure ""and bittersweet to have him revealed."" HOW TO SEND VALENTINES TO KIDS IN HOSPITALS, NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND MORE ""The Valentine’s Day bandit has given so much to the Portland community. His gift of love was anticipated by so many each February. I hope the tradition continues — it would be a wonderful tribute to someone who brought love and hope to all of us annually,"" the mayor said. The love and levity started in the mid-1970s before Fahrman took it over in 1979. Over the years, simple white sheets of paper with large red hearts appeared in Old Portland and in downtown on Feb. 14. The hearts were plastered on storefronts and business windows. Kevin Fahrman, 67, was posthumously identified as Portland, Maine's ""Valentine's Day Bandit,"" a mysterious prankster who attained local celebrity through his anonymous, elaborate displays of large red hearts in the city's downtown every February. It grew more elaborate over the years, with larger hearts appearing in unusual places, like Fort Gorges in Portland Harbor, and over the entrance of the Portland Library. This year, a big heart was draped from the city’s tallest building, an 18-floor apartment tower, which is still under construction. It was a courtship made in heaven — Fahrman loved Portland, and Portland loved him back. Fahrman was an accomplished photographer, and one of his favorite subjects was SailMaine. Fahrman’s daughter was involved in sailing, and she was one of his subjects. The Valentine effort went to great lengths. OTTERS AT NEW HAMPSHIRE AQUARIUM SPREAD VALENTINE'S DAY LOVE BY 'PAINTING' THEIR OWN VALENTINES It was no small feat to put a giant heart on an old fort in the Portland Harbor, reachable only by boat, by the dark of night in February, or from high vantages like the top of an 18-floor apartment building, the state’s largest building. His wife, Patti Urban, told the Portland Press Herald that she was a Valentine's Day widow. She said her husband was usually too wiped out from his late-night shenanigans to enjoy the day himself.

Georgia Power bills likely to rise by 12% in June,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. State regulatory staff and Georgia Power Co. have agreed on a plan that will boost power bills by 12% in June to cover the higher costs of natural gas and coal that the utility burns to generate electricity for its 2.7 million customers. The unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. filed new figures Monday saying it needs to collect an additional $6.6 billion from customers over the next three years, under an agreement it reached with Georgia Public Service Commission staff earlier this month. Because of declining natural gas price forecasts, that's actually $1.1 billion less than Georgia Power had earlier projected. But it will boost a typical residential bill to $147.50 a month, up $15.90 from the current $131.60. The increase had originally been predicted to be as high as $23. The five-member elected commission is scheduled to vote on fuel charges on May 16. Any final plan is likely to closely track the agreement between the company and the staff. Bill increases are stacking up for Georgia Power customers. Rates went up 2.5% last month in January after commissioners approved a three-year rate plan in December. Increases of 4.5% will follow in 2024 and 2025. Customers will also have to pay the costs of the third and fourth nuclear units at Plant Vogtle near Augusta. Unit 3 is projected to begin operation in May or June, leading to a roughly $4 a month increase for residential customers. A larger rate increase is likely to follow when Unit 4 begins operations, now projected before March 2024. GEORGIA BOY, 13, CHARGED IN EASTER SUNDAY MURDER OF MAN SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES Typically, a utility is allowed to charge customers for the cost of fuel, but isn’t allowed to make a profit on those charges, unlike the profits Georgia Power is guaranteed for investing in power plants and transmission lines. The all-Republican commission typically decides how much Georgia Power can collect for fuel once every two years. In the meantime, if prices change, the company may collect too much or too little. During this two-year period, even though commissioners approved a 15% boost in fuel costs that began in January 2022, the company collected far too little money. Natural gas prices skyrocketed because of an improving economy and the Ukraine war, and coal prices rose even more steeply in part because of supply and labor shortages. Georgia Power Co. and state regulatory staff agreed on a plan that will likely rise power bills by 12% in June. Georgia Power says it will end the period roughly $4.5 billion in the hole for fuel already burned. Most of the proposed rate increase will make up for that deficit, repaying the company over three years instead of the normal two because the debt is so large. The utility says it forecasts it also needs another $2.2 billion to make up for higher fuel prices going forward. Georgia Power and commission staff have agreed to let the company make larger changes to cover cost swings between fuel-cost rate cases. The agreement would let Georgia Power raise or lower fuel charges by as much as 40% in the interim, instead of the current 15%. Because of unrecovered debt, that ability would likely only be used to further raise customer bills in the next two years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The company and staff also agreed to raise a fuel cost discount for low-income senior citizens from $6 a month now to $8 a month. The Georgia Association of Manufacturers argues commissioners should stretch repayment of the deficit out over five years to reduce rate increases. Georgia Power said Monday it opposes a longer payback period. Environmentalists argue that commissioners should force Georgia Power to bear some rising fuel costs because it has shifted its generation portfolio to depend on natural gas, whose price is volatile. The company argues the commission has already approved the current generation mix as the most economical and reliable option. ",674,us

Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET. Though Thomas Alva Edison’s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don’t realize that Edison almost wasn’t the world’s greatest inventor. A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers. At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as ""a dunce."" But his mother saw something else in her Al. GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE While creating my new ""Turnabout Tales"" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison’s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself.  I believe each of us has a ""Turnabout Tale,"" whether in our past or in the future. Raymond Arroyo (Courtesy Raymond Arroyo) Edison’s ""Turnabout"" really began at age eight.  Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle’s schoolhouse in 1855.   The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al.  He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD.  Edison said of this period: ""The teachers did not sympathize with me and…my father thought I was stupid.""  His teacher did as well. One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was ""addled"" and ""unable to be taught."" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself.  Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison’s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor. Thomas Edison (Associated Press) Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al’s daring, hands on experimentation. Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor’s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom’s pursuits. I don’t know why Thomas Edison isn’t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life: ""My mother was the making of me…she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor."" Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo is the author of ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" (Fox News) It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing. ""Deafness probably drove me to reading."" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone. But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life. Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands. Surrounded by books, at his ""Invention Factory"" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation. Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe.  The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car—all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught. At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison’s must be preserved and spread.  History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future. Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother.  If it hadn’t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems.

"Black history through the years: Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Former Olympian John Carlos and former NFL player Jack Brewer join Harris Faulkner on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia. Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture. Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today. BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today. Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years. Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports. Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court. BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner. Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance. Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850). Portrait of Frederick Douglass, who was born into slavery in 1818. (iStock) Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland. He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress. Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881). BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment. Harriet Tubman, American abolitionist leader (1820-1913), escaped slavery by marrying a free man and led many other slaves to safety through the use of the abolitionist network known as the Underground Railroad.    (MPI/Getty Images) Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross. She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished. Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more."" Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS. By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid. Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri. While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865. Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree. YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college. American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation. Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports. Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage. Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900). Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931. American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports. He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke. Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth."" Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization. The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism."" Thurgood Marshall, the great-grandson of a slave, was the first Black member of the United States Supreme Court. (Getty Images) Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore. He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports. From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights. THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal."" Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases. His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991. Rosa Parks, civil rights activist, was born in 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. (Getty Images) Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports. At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow. The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time. The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute. She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991. Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill. In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U.S. House of Representatives reports. Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director and educational consultant before entering politics. Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Getty Images) Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws. He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.

"Carbon monoxide deaths are climbing, putting families in peril: ‘My son is lucky to be alive’","Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary on American tourists' deaths in the Bahamas, calls out CDC vaccine advisory panel pushing for COVID boosters in children Often dubbed ""the silent killer,"" carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless — it’s been shown to cause severe injury or death in hours or even minutes. Between 2009 and 2019, deaths from non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisoning have been on the rise, according to a new report released by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) last month. There were 250 deaths related to consumer products in 2019, more than in any other year in the report. Some 40% of those deaths were caused by engine-driven tools, including generators, power washers and lawn mowers. BAHAMAS SANDALS DEATHS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING, A QUIET KILLER Heating systems were behind another 28% of the deaths, the report said. Kristie Dusenberry, a mother and grandmother who lives with her family on a farm in American Falls, Idaho, knows all too well the devastating impacts of carbon monoxide poisoning. Her 21-year-old son, Brenden Dusenberry, nearly died recently when fumes filled his small apartment. About four months ago, her son had moved to Iowa, where he was living in an apartment above his uncle’s garage. ""He was excited about living closer to friends and had started a new job,"" Dusenberry told Fox News Digital in an interview. When a few family members tried to call Dusenberry’s son over the weekend, no one was able to reach him. Brenden Dusenberry, 21, from Idaho nearly died recently when fumes filled his small apartment. He is still recovering.  (Kristie Dusenberry) Around midnight on Sunday, Dusenberry got a call from her niece, who also lives at the house. ""She said Brenden was on the floor in the bathroom, couldn’t feel his left side and was throwing up,"" she said. ""No one had seen or heard from him for more than 24 hours."" When first responders arrived, they suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. Tests confirmed dangerously high levels in the room where Dusenberry’s son was found. ""They did say that all the carbon monoxide is gone — but all the damage it caused is not."" Over the next few hours, Dusenberry slowly pieced together what had happened. Her son had gotten very sick over the course of the day, then woke up in the middle of the night with severe thirst. When he tried to get out of bed, his entire left side had gone completely numb. ""Brenden fell and hit his head on a dresser, then tumbled down the stairs to the bathroom, and that's where they found him,"" Dusenberry explained. Brenden Dusenberry, 21, is pictured with his siblings (left). He's shown in the hospital after he was poisoned by carbon monoxide (right). (Kristie Dusenberry) The source of the fumes was a new heater for the outdoor swimming pool, which had just been hooked up and was kept in the garage below the room where Dusenberry’s son was living. Something had malfunctioned with the heater — causing carbon monoxide to fill the air. One of the doctors told Dusenberry that carbon monoxide is lighter than air. ""It actually floats and can go through sheet rock, or through any crack in the wall,"" she said. While Dusenberry realizes her son is lucky to be alive, she worries about his long and uncertain road to recovery. ""Brenden’s heart is not fully working right now,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""His lungs were inflamed when he got to the hospital, and he had to be put in a hyperbaric chamber to increase his oxygen levels."" TEXAS CARBON MONOXIDE LEAK HOSPITALIZES 6, INCLUDING 5 CHILDREN Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is sometimes used ​​for people who have moderate to severe carbon monoxide poisoning as a means of reducing the long-term cognitive effects. That's according to Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, medical toxicologist and co-medical director at the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C. ""People who have confusion, heart rhythm abnormalities or other evidence of heart damage, and other serious signs or symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, are potential candidates for hyperbaric oxygen therapy,"" she told Fox News Digital. Brenden Dusenberry, 21, who experienced carbon monoxide poisoning just last week, gets some physical therapy in the hospital. (Kristie Dusenberry) The doctors also realized that Dusenberry’s son’s kidneys weren’t functioning correctly, which meant he had to receive dialysis treatments. ""Brenden also has nerve damage on the left side of his body, and the doctors said it could take up to a year before he can use his left arm again,"" Dusenberry said. ""He still can’t walk, and he can’t keep any food or fluids down."" She added, ""They did say that all the carbon monoxide is gone — but all the damage it caused is not."" Dr. Dung Trinh, a brain health expert and owner of The Healthy Brain Clinic in Long Beach, California, said the most dangerous outcomes of carbon monoxide poisoning can include death, permanent organ damage and long-term neurological effects. ""Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that can bind to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing its ability to carry oxygen, leading to tissue hypoxia and damage to vital organs,"" he told Fox News Digital via email. LOVE THAT ‘NEW CAR SMELL’? STUDY SAYS THERE ARE CANCER-CAUSING CHEMICALS TO CONSIDER In cases where carbon monoxide poisoning is fatal, Trinh said the specific cause of death is often related to severe tissue hypoxia (low levels of oxygen in the tissues) and damage to the brain, heart or lungs, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or other life-threatening complications. Each year, carbon monoxide poisoning claims at least 420 lives. The effects of carbon monoxide poisoning can vary, depending on the severity of the exposure and individual factors, the doctor explained. ""In some cases, with prompt and appropriate medical treatment, the effects may be reversible, while in other cases, they may be permanent,"" he said. Certain people may be at a higher risk of dying or not recovering fully from carbon monoxide poisoning, such as infants, elderly individuals, pregnant women and those with pre-existing respiratory or cardiac conditions, the doctor said. Those who survive carbon monoxide poisoning may experience adverse long-term effects. ""These can include neurological symptoms like memory problems, difficulty concentrating and mood changes, as well as respiratory and cardiac issues, depending on the severity and duration of exposure,"" Trinh said. Dawn Quintana, 56, shown here, experienced carbon monoxide poisoning at her workplace in 2013. She still experiences cognitive deficits today. (Dawn Quintana) Dawn Quintana, a 56-year-old former IT worker in Lake Point, Utah, experienced carbon monoxide poisoning at her workplace in 2013, when machinery was being used inside with all the doors and windows closed. TOXIC CHEMICAL POISONING: HAVE YOU BEEN AFFECTED? HOW TO KNOW After repeated daily exposure — 10 hours a day, five days a week, for 90 days — Quintana was regularly experiencing severe flu-like symptoms and lost her sense of taste. When she was finally tested at the hospital, her levels of exposure were dangerously high. To this day, even after seven years of therapy, Quintana still experiences the lingering cognitive effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. ""Carbon monoxide poisoning is a medical emergency and requires prompt medical intervention."" ""Sometimes I know what I want to say, but it doesn't come out,"" she told Fox News Digital in an email. She also struggles with reading: ""I can look at something and read it silently just fine, but if I try to read out loud, the letters start to fall away from the page and the left side of the page goes blank."" Quintana has not been able to return to work. She can no longer look at computer screens without getting dizzy and nauseated. Her relationships with friends and family have suffered. ""The struggle that I go through daily — the loss of dignity — I would not wish it upon my worst enemy,"" she said. Each year, carbon monoxide poisoning claims the lives of at least 420 people and sends more than 100,000 people to emergency rooms in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased for approximately $20."" The good news is that it’s 100% preventable. ""Some strategies for safety and precaution against carbon monoxide poisoning include regular maintenance and inspection of fuel-burning appliances, proper ventilation in enclosed spaces, using carbon monoxide detectors and avoiding the use of fuel-burning appliances indoors or in enclosed spaces without proper ventilation,"" Trinh said. You may not be able to see, smell or taste carbon monoxide — but a working carbon monoxide detector can enable you to ""hear"" it, said Johnson-Arbor. ""Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased for [about] $20 at big-box retailers, home improvement stores or even on Amazon,"" she told Fox News Digital. Residential carbon monoxide detectors can be plugged into an electrical outlet or can be hard-wired into a home’s electric system. (iStock) Residential carbon monoxide detectors can be plugged into an electrical outlet or can be hard-wired into a home’s electric system, Johnson-Arbor said. Experts recommend having a carbon monoxide detector installed within 10 feet of every sleeping area. ""Because carbon monoxide poisoning can cause excessive sleepiness, it’s important to have a detector installed within 10 feet of every sleeping area of your home,"" she said. Additionally, she recommends bringing a portable carbon monoxide detector when traveling, because some hotels or vacation rentals may not have them installed.

""Never ignore an alarming carbon monoxide detector,"" Johnson-Arbor added. ""These devices can save your life."" While many people associate carbon monoxide poisoning as a risk during the winter months due to malfunctioning furnaces and lack of ventilation, precautions should be taken year-round, warned Johnson-Arbor. ""During the summer months, people can be poisoned by carbon monoxide from faulty swimming pool heaters, indoor use of barbecue grills, gas-powered clothes dryers and other equipment,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Be well: Catch skin cancer warning signs early with regular self-exams,"Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the rise of artificial intelligence in medicine, including a new tool that accurately detects early markers of brain cancer. Every day, more than 9,500 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with skin cancer, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, a New York City-based nonprofit. Early detection and treatment is the key to a positive outcome, doctors say — and performing regular self-exams is the best way to catch the warning signs. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends checking your skin from head to toe at least once a month. HUGH JACKMAN UNDERGOES BIOPSIES FOR CANCER SCARE, EMPHASIZES SUNSCREEN USE ""A change to a mole, a sore that won’t heal or a new growth may be a warning sign of skin cancer,"" said Dr. Nandini Kulkarni, medical director of surgical oncology for Inspira Health in Vineland, New Jersey. ""By conducting regular skin checks, you will become familiar with the pattern of moles, blemishes, freckles and other marks on your skin,"" she said. Check your skin from head to toe at least once a month, says the Skin Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit. (iStock) ""When you notice a change, you should see your dermatologist."" Keep an eye out for any new, expanding or changing growths, spots or bumps on the skin, says the American Cancer Society. ""Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, even areas that are not exposed to the sun."" Other warning signs include a sore that bleeds and/or doesn’t heal after several weeks, a rough or scaly patch of skin, a wart-like growth, or an irregularly shaped or colored mole. ""The letters A-B-C-D-E can help you remember what to look for,"" said Dr. Kulkarni. These include: A - Asymmetry B - Borders (irregular, raised) C - Color (especially change in color of a prior mole) D - Diameter (larger than a pencil eraser) E - Evolving changes The best time to do a skin self-exam is after a shower or bath, according to Dr. Kulkarni. Keep an eye out for any new, expanding or changing growths, spots or bumps on the skin, experts recommend. (iStock) For consistency, do the exam the same way each time. Choose a well-lit room and use both a full-length mirror and a hand mirror to ensure that nothing gets missed, the doctor said. SKIN CANCER CHECKS AND SUNSCREEN: WHY THESE (STILL) MATTER VERY MUCH FOR GOOD HEALTH In addition to the more obvious areas, such as the face, arms, legs and sides, remember to check hidden spots like between the fingers, the soles of the feet and the scalp. ""If needed, ask someone for help when checking your skin,"" Dr. Kulkarni suggested. ""This can help with hard-to-see areas like your back and scalp."" The experts agree that self-exams should be a supplement to regular checks at the dermatologist — not a replacement.

"Strep throat infections have spiked above pre-COVID highs, says report: 'We've missed cases'","Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier discusses the rise of Group-A Strep and other respiratory illnesses after the deaths of two Colorado children. After plummeting during the COVID pandemic in 2020 and 2021, strep throat infections skyrocketed in February 2023, according to a report from Epic Research, a health analytics firm. The rate of infections of group A strep (caused by the Streptococcus bacteria) was 30% higher than the previous peak seen in February 2017, the report found. Leading up to the pandemic, between January 2017 and February 2020, cases of strep throat followed a consistent pattern. Usually, the cases would begin to increase in the fall and peak in February — before dipping again in spring and summer, said the reports from Epic, which is based in Verona, Wisconsin. 'GREAT CONCERN': INVASIVE GROUP A STREP CASES SPIKING IN PARTS OF US — CDC IS INVESTIGATING Starting in March 2020, amid stay-at-home orders early in the pandemic, strep throat infections plummeted. Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that severe cases of strep infections decreased by around 25% during the pandemic. After plummeting during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, strep throat infections skyrocketed in February 2023, according to a report from Epic Research of Wisconsin. (iStock) Strep cases didn’t start to increase again until September 2022, then skyrocketed in the winter leading into 2023. Epic’s data is based on the share of clinic and emergency room visits between January 2017 and February 2023 that resulted in positive group A strep cases across the U.S. and Lebanon. (The data come from ""Cosmos, a HIPAA-defined Limited Data Set of more than 184 million patients from 199 Epic organizations including 1,147 hospitals and more than 24,900 clinics,"" said Epic in its report, in part.) A majority of the cases affected children ages 4 to 13. HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SHOULD DROP MASK REQUIREMENTS, MEDICAL EXPERTS SAY ""The rates of group A strep infections, including the more dangerous invasive type, are at the highest levels seen in years,"" confirmed Dr. Shana Johnson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician in Scottsdale, Arizona. ""In February, strep cases were 30% higher than the previous peak seen in 2017."" The CDC’s early data also reflect these findings, showing that cases of both invasive and less severe strep are at elevated levels, ""similar to or higher than those seen in pre-pandemic years."" Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, told Fox News Digital that the spike in strep A cases is likely a result of other circulating viruses. ""The recent assault of viruses, including COVID-19, have weakened people’s immune systems,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Also, we haven't been on the lookout for it and have missed cases."" In most cases, strep A causes mild illness, with common symptoms including sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever, red and swollen tonsils, swollen lymph nodes and tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth, per the CDC. Occasionally, group A strep can lead to severe infections (invasive Group A strep, or iGA), which in rare cases can cause sepsis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis (a serious bacterial infection that destroys tissue). These cases require immediate treatment. The rate of Streptococcus (strep) bacteria infections was 30% higher than the previous peak seen in February 2017. (iStock) In the U.S., there are between 14,000 and 25,000 cases of invasive group A strep cases per year, with 1,500 to 2,300 of them causing death, the CDC reported. ""Unlike respiratory viral illnesses like the common cold and flu, group A strep is best treated with antibiotics,"" Dr. Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""Antibiotics for strep throat reduce how long you are sick and prevent the infection from getting more severe and spreading to other parts of the body."" With the current antibiotic shortage, some cases aren’t receiving timely treatment, Dr. Siegel said. ""When we don't treat it quickly, it has more time to spread,"" he told Fox News Digital. EUROPEAN UNION DRUG REGULATOR DETERMINES ANTIBIOTIC SHORTAGE NOT A ‘MAJOR EVENT’ In October 2022, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) reported a shortage of amoxicillin, which, along with penicillin, is among the most commonly prescribed treatments for strep. As of April 2023, amoxicillin remains on the drug shortage list. Group A strep bacteria spreads through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, per the CDC’s website. ""The recent assault of viruses, including COVID-19, have weakened people’s immune systems."" ""If you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes after touching something that has these droplets on it, you may become ill,"" the CDC said. In most cases, strep A causes mild illness, with common symptoms including sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever, red and swollen tonsils, swollen lymph nodes and tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth, per the CDC. (iStock) To help reduce the spread, doctors say to wash hands often with soap and water, avoid sharing glasses or utensils with those who are infected, and cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

"Flu diagnosis could significantly raise heart attack risk, new study finds","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. People who get influenza could be six times more susceptible to having a heart attack in the days following a flu diagnosis, a new study from the Netherlands has found. The study’s conclusions were scheduled to be presented on April 18 at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in Copenhagen, Denmark, as reported by Medscape. The lead researcher, Dr. Annemarijn de Boer with the Julius Center for Life Sciences and Primary Care at the University Medical Center Utrecht, analyzed test results from 16 labs in the Netherlands, as well as medical and death records. Of 26,221 cases of influenza between the years 2008 and 2019, 401 people experienced at least one heart attack within a year of the diagnosis, the report said. HEART DISEASE RISK COULD BE AFFECTED BY ONE SURPRISING FACTOR, NEW STUDY FINDS Additionally, people had a 6.16 times higher likelihood of having a heart attack in the week after getting the flu compared to the year before or after, the researchers found. However, when excluding the deaths that occurred outside the hospital, the increased risk was 2.42 times instead of 6.16. People who get influenza could be six times more susceptible to having a heart attack in the days following a flu diagnosis, a new study from the Netherlands has found. (iStock) This is likely because most flu testing in the Netherlands is performed in the hospital, which means patients are more likely to have severe illness, according to de Boer. Similar findings came from a 2018 Canadian study led by Dr. Jeffrey C. Kwong from the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto, Ontario. Researchers found that participants were 6.05 times more likely to have a heart attack in the week after diagnosis. Board-certified cardiologist Dr. Mary Greene with Manhattan Cardiology in New York City was not involved in the study, but reviewed the findings. HEART DISEASE, THE SILENT KILLER: STUDY SHOWS IT CAN STRIKE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS ""While the methodology of this particular Dutch study did not yield as much robust data, the study certainly echoes previous studies that have come to similar conclusions,"" Greene told Fox News Digital. ""Seemingly common colds can turn into serious medical issues."" ""I do agree that a flu diagnosis can increase the odds of heart attack in a select group of patients, especially those with underlying heart disease,"" she added. The increase in heart attacks among patients diagnosed with influenza, said Greene, largely stems from the inflammatory process and the environment that is created within the body when someone is fighting off the flu or other viral illnesses. To help minimize the risk of heart attacks, all people should have a cardiovascular screening starting at age 40, or earlier if there is a history of early heart disease in the family, says one cardiologist.

"AI model helps predict strokes with more accuracy, researchers say","'The CyberGuy' Kurt Knutsson gives a rundown on concerns over using artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and scammers using the software for voice cloning. Using machine learning methods and available data when patients enter the hospital, researchers have developed a model that predicts strokes with more accuracy than current models. The team from Carnegie Mellon University, Florida International University and Santa Clara University published their work in the Journal of Medical Internet Research earlier this year. Examining more than 143,000 hospital visits of patients in Florida acute care hospitals from 2012 to 2014, and social determinants of health data – including the conditions people are born into and live in, and what drives those conditions – from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, the study's authors sought to develop a stroke-prediction algorithm. Their model incorporated variables routinely collected by health care providers and payers, including basic demographics, the number of chronic conditions and insurance.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The authors said the model had 84% precision in predicting strokes, outperforming existing scales that miss as many as 30% of strokes. The authors said use of the model suggests that it is possible to predict the likelihood of a patient’s condition being a stroke at the time of hospital presentation, based on patients’ demographics and social determinants of health available at the time of entry – before obtaining any diagnostic imaging or laboratory test results. There were some limitations to the study, including that the study was retroactive, that confirming stroke cases relied on International Classification of Diseases codes and did not involve reviewing patients’ records, and the social determinants of health variables available in administrative data. Furthermore, they cautioned that their algorithm should not be considered as a gold standard for stroke diagnosis, but as a model that complements existing stroke-scoring systems used in hospitals.

"Hospitals and health care facilities should drop mask requirements, medical experts say","Walensky told Congress that masking guidance ‘doesn’t really change with time’ but with the level of disease. Even after mask mandates were dropped across the country amid dwindling COVID-19 cases and deaths, face coverings have still been required in many doctors’ offices, hospitals and other health care settings. Now, a group of esteemed medical experts is calling for a change. In an April 18 journal entry in the Annals of Internal Medicine, an academic medical journal, several physicians — including infectious disease specialists — wrote that it’s time to remove masking requirements in health care facilities. ""While critically important in the earlier phases of the pandemic, we’ve entered a more stable phase, with substantial population-level immunity, durable protection against severe disease, a series of less virulent variants, and other important and favorable changes,"" said corresponding author Erica S. Shenoy, M.D., PhD, in a press release. FACE MASKS MADE ‘LITTLE TO NO DIFFERENCE’ IN PREVENTING SPREAD OF COVID, SCIENTIFIC REVIEW FINDS She is the medical director of infection control for Mass General Brigham and an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""As conditions change, we need to re-evaluate our infection prevention policies, including masking requirements in health care settings, and adapt,"" she added. Even after mask mandates were dropped across the country amid dwindling COVID-19 cases and deaths, face coverings have still been required in many doctors’ offices, hospitals and other health care settings. Now, a group of doctors is calling for this to end.  (iStock) Other contributing physicians came from Harvard Medical School, Washington University School of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine and Trinity Health Michigan. ""Masking requirements in health care have continued longer than in the community because these settings have a higher proportion of individuals at high risk for complications of infection,"" the authors wrote in the journal entry. ""However, the context and conditions of the pandemic have changed dramatically and favorably since masking requirements in health care were initially adopted, and evidence-based public health policy should also adapt in response."" Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical and a Fox News contributor, agreed with the decision. ""It makes complete sense to remove the universal mask requirements for medical centers — and NYU did it weeks ago,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""It hasn't made sense for a while."" ""We should adapt mask policies to reflect this new reality."" Dr. Shana Johnson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician in Scottsdale, Arizona, reviewed the doctors’ recommendations. ""As we transition to the place where SARS-CoV-2 is a constant and stable presence in our community, we should adapt mask policies to reflect this new reality,"" she told Fox News Digital. In the journal entry, the authors pointed out that masking in health care settings was appropriate early in the pandemic as a means of limiting spread among medical personnel, patients and visitors. Dr. Marc Siegel of New York City said he continues to wear a KN95 or N95 mask in the room with most patients, especially those with respiratory symptoms. He said, however, that it ""makes complete sense to remove the universal mask requirements for medical centers."" (iStock) But as the population has achieved greater immunity and COVID has entered a ""more stable phase"" — and as public health agencies and the U.S. government have declared that the public health emergency is over — the physicians stated in the findings that the small benefits of continuing to require masks don’t justify the costs. ""Masks do have downsides, such as impaired communication and disrupted human connection."" ""After three years of universal masking in health care, the risk-benefit calculation has shifted,"" said Shira Doron, M.D., chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine health system and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, in the press release announcing the paper. ""Masks do have downsides, such as impaired communication and disrupted human connection.  We are at a stage of the pandemic where it now makes sense to end mandatory masking,"" she added. PARENTS NOW QUESTION WHETHER COVID MASK MANDATES DID MORE HARM THAN GOOD Among the drawbacks of masks, the study authors cited an ""increased cognitive load"" for doctors who are trying to listen to patients wearing face coverings. This is particularly difficult for patients who do not speak fluent English or who are hard of hearing, they added. ""Masks obscure facial expression; contribute to feelings of isolation; and negatively impact human connection, trust and perception of empathy,"" the authors wrote. ""Masking is not without its downsides,"" Dr. Johnson said. ""Masks make it more difficult to hear, understand and communicate with your provider. Some choice makes sense."" In lieu of universal masking, the study authors suggested that health care settings should follow ""Standard Precautions and Transmission-Based Precautions,"" as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""Masks obscure facial expression; contribute to feelings of isolation; and negatively impact human connection, trust and perception of empathy,"" the authors wrote. (iStock) Health care personnel should wear masks to prevent exposure as needed, according to those guidelines. Also, any people with respiratory symptoms (namely, coughing or sneezing) should use a face covering. Additionally, if a medical worker is ""caring for patients with suspected or confirmed respiratory infection, they should use personal protective equipment and other interventions."" Rather than having universal masking requirements, Dr. Siegel believes the decision should be ""based on individual risk."" ""Universal masking in health care is a policy whose time has come and gone ... for now."" ""It should be reserved for patients who are immunocompromised or severely or chronically ill or the doctors that care for them,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Patients who are acutely ill and those with chronic lung problems should continue to wear masks."" The doctor said he continues to wear a KN95 or N95 mask in the room with most patients, especially those with respiratory symptoms. ""Certain health care settings with high-risk patients could still choose to use universal masking, but it would not be required in other areas of normal risk,"" added Dr. Johnson. Along with dropping mask requirements in health care settings, the physicians wrote that other protocols should be reconsidered. The doctors wrote that in addition to universal masking, other early pandemic strategies, such as asymptomatic testing and contact tracing, should also be reconsidered. (AP) ""Moving away from universal masking policies should be accompanied by reconsideration of other pandemic-era strategies (for example, asymptomatic testing, resource-intensive contact tracing), which similarly have experienced a shift in their risk-benefit balance over the course of the pandemic,"" they stated in the discussion. The latest commentary doesn’t mean that masking policies won’t return sometime in the future, the physicians noted. ""Future pandemics or significant localized outbreaks may justify more widespread or targeted masking policies, respectively, as part of a bundled response,"" they wrote, noting that it’s important to educate health care personnel and patients as policies change. COVID-19'S LASTING IMPACT: 'LESS ATTRACTIVE' PEOPLE WEAR MASKS MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS, STUDY FINDS ""Change and adaptation are expected,"" said senior author Dr. Westyn Branch-Elliman, an infectious diseases specialist and clinical investigator at VA Boston Healthcare System. ""That does not mean 'the science has changed,' but almost everything around it has."" The doctors called for ""focused research"" to ""ensure requirements are not maintained longer than necessary and are reinstated when needed."" Additionally, the authors noted that the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ""is currently reevaluating existing approaches to Transmission-Based Precautions, which is likely to inform future considerations for health care transmission mitigation strategies."" The authors pointed out that masking in health care settings was appropriate early in the pandemic as a means of limiting spread among medical personnel, patients and visitors. Now, however, they said that ""universal masking in health care is a policy whose time has come and gone … for now.""

ChatGPT for health care providers: Can the AI chatbot make the professionals' jobs easier?,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he was ""a little bit scared"" of ChatGPT and admitted that his technology would likely destroy ""a lot of current jobs."" In addition to writing articles, songs and code in mere seconds, ChatGPT could potentially make its way into your doctor’s office — if it hasn’t already. The artificial intelligence-based chatbot, released by OpenAI in December 2022, is a natural language processing (NLP) model that draws on information from the web to produce answers in a clear, conversational format. While it’s not intended to be a source of personalized medical advice, patients are able to use ChatGPT to get information on diseases, medications and other health topics. CHATGPT AND HEALTH CARE: COULD THE AI CHATBOT CHANGE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE? Some experts even believe the technology could help physicians provide more efficient and thorough patient care. Dr. Tinglong Dai, professor of operations management at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School in Baltimore, Maryland, and an expert in artificial intelligence, said that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have ""upped the game"" in medical AI. Some experts believe that the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot could help physicians provide more efficient and thorough patient care. (iStock) ""The AI we see in the hospital today is purpose-built and trained on data from specific disease states — it often can't adapt to new scenarios and new situations, and can't use medical knowledge bases or perform basic reasoning tasks,"" he told Fox News Digital in an email. ""LLMs give us hope that general AI is possible in the world of health care."" One potential use for ChatGPT is to provide clinical decision support to doctors and medical professionals, assisting them in selecting the appropriate treatment options for patients. In a preliminary study from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, researchers analyzed the quality of 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions regarding clinical decisions. Out of the 20 highest-scoring responses, nine of them came from ChatGPT. ""The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low acceptance, bias, inversion and redundancy,"" the researchers wrote in the study findings, which were published in the National Library of Medicine. Dai noted that doctors can enter medical records from a variety of sources and formats — including images, videos, audio recordings, emails and PDFs — into large language models like ChatGPT to get second opinions. AI HEALTH CARE PLATFORM PREDICTS DIABETES WITH HIGH ACCURACY BUT 'WON'T REPLACE PATIENT CARE' ""It also means that providers can build more efficient and effective patient messaging portals that understand what patients need and direct them to the most appropriate parties or respond to them with automated responses,"" he added. Dr. Justin Norden, a digital health and AI expert who is an adjunct professor at Stanford University in California, said he's heard senior physicians say that ChatGPT is probably ""as good or better"" than most interns during their first year out of medical school. One potential use for ChatGPT is to provide clinical decision support to doctors and medical professionals, assisting them in selecting the appropriate treatment options for patients. (iStock) ""We’re seeing medical plans generated in seconds,"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""These tools can be used to draw relevant information for a provider, to act as a sort of ‘co-pilot’ to help someone think through other things they could consider."" Norden is especially excited about ChatGPT’s potential use for health education in a clinical setting. ""I think one of the amazing things about these tools is that you can take a body of information and transform what it looks like for many different audiences, languages and reading comprehension levels,"" he said. ""Currently, ChatGPT has a very high risk of being 'unacceptably wrong' far too often."" For example, ChatGPT could enable physicians to fully explain complex medical concepts and treatments to each patient in a way that’s digestible and easy to understand, said Norden. ""For example, after having a procedure, the patient could chat with that body of information and ask follow-up questions,"" Norden said. The lowest-hanging fruit for using ChatGPT in health care, said Norden, is to streamline administrative tasks, which is a ""huge time component"" for medical providers. In particular, he said some providers are looking to the chatbot to streamline medical notes and documentation. ""On the clinical side, people are already starting to experiment with GPT models to help with writing notes, drafting patient summaries, evaluating patient severity scores and finding clinical information quickly,"" he said. Some experts believe that AI language models such as ChatGPT could potentially help streamline patient discharge instructions.  (iStock) ""Additionally, on the administrative side, it is being used for prior authorization, billing and coding, and analytics,"" Norden added. Two medical tech companies that have made significant headway into these applications are Doximity and Nuance, Norden pointed out. Doximity, a professional medical network for physicians headquartered in San Francisco, launched its DocsGPT platform to help doctors write letters of medical necessity, denial appeals and other medical documents. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH CARE: NEW PRODUCT ACTS AS 'COPILOT FOR DOCTORS' Nuance, a Microsoft company based in Massachusetts that creates AI-powered health care solutions, is piloting its GPT4-enabled note-taking program. The plan is to start with a smaller subset of beta users and gradually roll out the system to its 500,000+ users, said Norden. While he believes these types of tools are still in need of regulatory ""guard rails,"" he sees a big potential for this type of use, both inside and outside health care. ""If I have a big database or pile of documents, I can ask a natural question and start to pull out relevant pieces of information — large language models have shown they're very good at that,"" he said. The hospital discharge process involves many steps, including assessing the patient’s medical condition, identifying follow-up care, prescribing and explaining medications, providing lifestyle restrictions and more, according to Johns Hopkins. AI language models like ChatGPT could potentially help streamline patient discharge instructions, Norden believes. AI VS. CANCER: MOUNT SINAI SCIENTIST SAYS BREAKTHROUGH TECH HAS ‘DRASTIC IMPACT’ ON DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT ""This is incredibly important, especially for someone who has been in the hospital for a while,"" he told Fox News Digital. Patients ""might have lots of new medications, things they have to do and follow up on, and they're often left with [a] few pieces of printed paper and that’s it."" He added, ""Giving someone far more information in a language that they understand, in a format they can continue to interact with, I think is really powerful."" While ChatGPT could potentially streamline routine health care tasks and increase providers’ access to vast amounts of medical data, it is not without risks, according to experts. Dr. Tim O’Connell, the vice chair of medical informatics in the department of radiology at the University of British Columbia, said there is a serious privacy risk when users copy and paste patients’ clinical notes into a cloud-based service like ChatGPT. ""We want medical AI software to be trustworthy."" ""Unlike ChatGPT, most clinical NLP solutions are deployed into a secure installation so that sensitive data is not shared with anyone outside the organization,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Both Canada and Italy have announced that they are investigating OpenAI [ChatGPT's parent corporation] to see if they are collecting or using personal information inappropriately."" Additionally, O’Connell said the risk of ChatGPT generating false information could be dangerous. Health care providers generally categorize mistakes as ""acceptably wrong"" or ""unacceptably wrong,"" he said. While ChatGPT could potentially streamline routine health care tasks and increase providers’ access to vast amounts of medical data, it’s not without risks, experts say. (Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""An example of 'acceptably wrong' would be for a system not to recognize a word because a care provider used an ambiguous acronym,"" he explained. ""An 'unacceptably wrong' situation would be where a system makes a mistake that any human — even one who is not a trained professional — would not make.""
