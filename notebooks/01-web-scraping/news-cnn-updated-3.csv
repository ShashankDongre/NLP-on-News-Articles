      Wall Street Journal: Bud Light owner places two execs on leave after transgender influencer backlash
    ","Anheuser-Busch has placed two executives who managed Bud Light’s sponsorship of two Instagram posts from a transgender woman on leave, according to the Wall Street Journal and other media reports. Ad Age was the first to report that Alissa Heinerscheid, Bud Light’s vice president of marketing, was placed on leave. Todd Allen, most recently Budweiser’s vice president of global marketing, is set to replace her. Daniel Blake, Anheuser-Busch’s vice president who oversees market for mainstream brands, was also put on leave, according to the Wall Street Journal. Anheuser-Busch did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. The executive shakeup comes after Bud Light saw both support from trans activists and backlash from conservative media for its collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who has 1.8 million followers on Instagram and 10.8 million on TikTok. The beer maker sponsored two Instagram posts by Mulvaney and sent her a can of beer with her face on it. “Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics,” the brewery giant told CNN last week. “From time to time we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Dylan Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public.” A few days after the post was published, musician Kid Rock posted an Instagram video of himself shooting cases of Bud Light, and conservatives called for a boycott of the company. The online backlash ramped up to physical danger when Anheuser-Busch facilities received threats. The Los Angeles police department told CNN last week that it responded to a bomb threat and conducted a sweep of an Anheuser-Busch brewery in the Van Nuys neighborhood. Heinerscheid said in a recent Make Yourself at Home podcast interview that Bud Light needs to attract young drinkers to ensure the company’s future, with one avenue being to promote inclusivity. The company has a history of appealing to LGBTQ+ drinkers, releasing beer in rainbow bottles for Pride Month and partnering with LGBTQ+ support organizations. Heinerscheid was appointed to the marketing vice president position in June 2022, becoming the first woman in the brand’s 40 year history to occupy that role. The backlash against Bud Light and Mulvaney comes against a backdrop of legislation targeting transgender people and the growth of anti-trans rhetoric among conservative politicians. The House last Thursday passed a GOP-led bill banning transgender athletes from women’s and girls’ sports at federally funded schools and educational institutions. The bill is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate. Pushes for other anti-trans measures have ramped up in Republican-led states, such as bans on gender-affirming health care for transgender youth in Idaho and Indiana. More broadly, a record 417 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in state legislatures this year, according to American Civil Liberties Union data as of April 3. That’s more than twice the number of such bills introduced in 2022. It remains unclear whether Anheuser-Busch will see blows to its bottom line from the controversy, with experts expecting no sizable damage — but the company could have to answer questions about the matter when it reports first-quarter earnings on May 4.

      NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell fired after allegations of sexual harassment were corroborated, Comcast says
    ","Comcast said Monday it fired NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell after corroborating a female employee’s allegations of sexual harassment. An attorney representing CNBC anchor and senior international correspondent Hadley Gamble acknowledged Comcast investigated Shell because of her client’s complaint. CNN typically does not name victims of alleged sexual misconduct but is identifying Gamble because she gave her attorney permission to issue a statement on her behalf. “The investigation into Mr. Shell arose from a complaint by my client of sexual harassment and sex discrimination,” said Suzanne McKie, a managing partner of Farore Law, who is representing Gamble, in a statement to CNN. “Given these circumstances it is very disappointing that my client’s name has been released and her privacy violated.” Gamble provided emails which backed up her complaint, and NBC quickly hired outside legal counsel to investigate, according to multiple sources. After looking into the allegations, Comcast moved quickly to remove Shell, they said. Two sources familiar with the matter said Gamble had been informed the network was not renewing her contract, though it was unknown why it was not renewed. As of Monday afternoon, Gamble is still listed as a CNBC anchor on the channel’s official website. Shell’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Shell announced his surprising and immediate departure in a statement Sunday. “I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret,” Shell said in his statement. “I’m truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege.” Comcast declined to comment on the allegations from Gamble’s lawyer. But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Comcast said it fired Shell due to allegations of sexual harassment. “Following a complaint that Jeffrey Shell, CEO of NBCUniversal, engaged in inappropriate conduct with a female employee, including allegations of sexual harassment, Comcast Corporation retained outside counsel to investigate the allegations,” the filing said. “During the investigation, evidence was uncovered that corroborated the allegations. As a consequence, on April 23, 2023, the company terminated Mr. Shell’s employment with cause under his employment agreement, effective immediately.” Shell carried out his normal duties while the company engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation, a person familiar with the matter said. There is no search underway for a successor to Shell, the person added. In the meantime, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh will assume Shell’s duties. Shell had been named CEO in January 2020 after leading content creation, programming and distribution for NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment.

      How coupons backfired on Bed Bath & Beyond
    ","For decades, blue and white paper coupons defined Bed Bath & Beyond’s brand, popping up everywhere from the movie “Old School” to notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s junk drawer. But the iconic 20%-off coupons, which became known as Big Blue, ultimately contributed to the cornerstone retailer’s fall into bankruptcy. On Wednesday, Bed Bath & Beyond will stop honoring Big Blue coupons for good. Once a hugely popular marketing tool, the coupons backfired as the retailing business changed. They eroded Bed Bath & Beyond’s profit margins, hurt its brand image and trained customers to only shop at stores if they had a coupon stashed away. This made it much harder for Bed Bath & Beyond to sell merchandise at full price, as customers began to perceive Bed Bath & Beyond’s products as overpriced unless they had a coupon. That led to a perhaps inevitable bankruptcy. “It’s a very effective short-term strategy in terms of generating sales, but coupons are not good for long-term loyalty,” said Yuping Liu-Thompkins, a professor of marketing at Old Dominion University and director of the university’s Loyalty Sciences Lab on customer loyalty. Bed Bath & Beyond used coupons to draw shoppers into its maze-like stores. Once customers were inside, the company hoped they would wander around and impulse shop — buying linens, towels, pots and everything else that caught their eye. Redeeming coupons makes shoppers feel smart — like they’ve outfoxed a brand. One study found customers who received coupons released feel-good oxytocin hormones and their heart rates decreased. As online shopping grew, coupons became a less effective tool because customers could compare prices across different sites to find the lowest one. Rival stores also began to offer price-match guarantees. By then, Bed Bath & Beyond was hooked on coupons and couldn’t successfully pivot away. “They never grew out of their coupon strategy, which is sadly what led to their current situation,” said Liu-Thompkins. In the company’s early years – it dates to 1971 – coupons were infrequent, attached to circulars and for offers like $5 off a purchase of at least $15, according to a 2020 New York Times oral history of the coupons. Bed Bath & Beyond’s coupons took off during the 1990s. The company tried different colors like red and yellow, but they were too harsh. Instead, it went with Pantone 2735c. Soon, Bed Bath & Beyond was sending out nearly a billion coupons by mail a year, according to the Times. “We started to realize that what customers really wanted was the darn coupon. To hell with the rest of the stuff,” Rita Little, the company’s former vice president of marketing, told the Times. In the marketing business, sentiment was turning away from coupons. Critics say offering coupons is a waste of money that would be better directed toward dropping prices across the board or investing in improving products’ quality. Bed Bath & Beyond tried to move away from coupons during the 2010s after they squeezed profit margins. In 2016, Bed Bath & Beyond began testing a membership model that for $29 a year offered a 20% discount on all purchases and free shipping. But the membership never caught on. Customers were too attached to Bed Bath & Beyond’s coupons and resisted any changes to the model. Other chains, such as JCPenney, also tried to pull back on coupons and faced customer backlash. In 2020, Bed Bath & Beyond said it was scaling back its coupon program to boost its business. “We have an overreliance on the coupon,” one executive said at the time. But two years later, company executives called the move a “big mistake,” admitting they had misjudged how much shoppers had come to embrace the regular cadence of the Big Blue coupons. “The coupon was both its greatest strength and weakness,” said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst at UBS.

      Appeals court largely sides with Apple on ‘Fortnite’ antitrust case
    ","A federal appeals court largely sided with Apple on Monday in a closely watched case about its app store policies, a decision that could complicate future efforts to regulate app store operators and frustrate claims that Apple behaves monopolistically. The decision in the case involving Epic Games, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite,” upholds a lower court ruling that found Apple is not a monopolist in the distribution of iOS apps, and that Apple did not violate antitrust laws by requiring app developers to use Apple’s proprietary in-app payment systems. In reaching its conclusion, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said Epic Games failed to show how Apple could have implemented “alternative means for Apple to accomplish the procompetitive justifications supporting iOS’s walled garden ecosystem.” Apple grounds its app store restrictions in security and privacy rationales that differentiate the company from other mobile operating system makers such as Google, the court said, creating “a heterogenous market for app-transaction platforms which, as a result, increases interbrand competition” between iOS and Android. In a statement, Apple said the court had handed it a “resounding victory.” “For the second time in two years, a federal court has ruled that Apple abides by antitrust laws at the state and federal levels. The App Store continues to promote competition, drive innovation, and expand opportunity, and we’re proud of its profound contributions to both users and developers around the world,” the company said. “We respectfully disagree with the court’s ruling on the one remaining claim under state law and are considering further review.” Epic said “Apple prevailed at the 9th Circuit Court.” It added: “Though the court upheld the ruling that Apple’s restraints have ‘a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers’, they found we didn’t prove our Sherman Act case.” The ruling comes as policymakers worldwide have begun circling around app store providers with legislation and investigations that view the industry’s practices skeptically. For years, app makers have accused Apple and Google of charging excessive fees, imposing burdensome restrictions and bullying developers who protest the policies. Epic and Google are embroiled in a separate lawsuit over similar issues. The high-stakes legal battle in Epic Games v. Apple first arose in 2020, when Epic sought to trigger a confrontation with Apple by telling Fortnite players they could purchase the game’s virtual currency, V-Bucks, at a lower price if they did so directly on Epic’s website rather than through the iOS app. Apple responded by removing Fortnite from the iOS App Store, a move Epic anticipated and that prompted Epic to sue. Apple countersued Epic, accusing it of breach of contract. On Monday, in addition to siding with Apple on the antitrust claims, the appeals court held that Apple is entitled to have Epic cover its legal fees stemming from the countersuit, reversing a lower-court decision. The appeals court agreed with the lower court, however, that Apple violated California’s unfair competition law when, in its developer agreement, Apple forbade Epic from informing iOS users about other ways they could pay for in-game virtual currency besides using Apple’s in-app payment system. Monday’s ruling upholds an injunction that, if allowed to take effect, would prevent Apple from intervening when developers include “buttons, external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms” apart from Apple’s own channels. The court also held that developer agreements such as the ones Apple signs with app makers are subject to the nation’s anti-monopoly laws, contrary to the lower-court ruling. That finding could give some ammunition to critics of app store operators. Both sides now have several weeks to determine whether to seek a rehearing from the appeals court or to appeal to the Supreme Court.

      Layoffs loom in the US manufacturing sector as backlogs shrink
    ","US manufacturers have now mostly worked their way through their backlogged orders — and that means job cuts could be on the horizon as soon as this year. Those orders, which accumulated because of supply chain disruptions in the early days of the pandemic, have helped keep the manufacturing industry mostly insulated from the mass layoffs seen in other sectors, like technology and finance. Supply chains, which clogged up during the pandemic and were choked off again after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have improved considerably in the past year, and manufacturing backlogs are dwindling fast. Meanwhile, demand for manufactured goods has fallen in recent months as consumers and businesses pulled back on purchases in favor of experiences such as travel and dining out. An analysis by Wells Fargo economists provided to CNN shows that unfilled orders of core capital goods adjusted for inflation, or backlogs, are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels within the next five months. And surveys from the Institute for Supply Management show that the manufacturing sector has been contracting for several months, while fewer manufacturers report an increase in backlogs. While softer demand has allowed manufacturers to reduce their backlog, once it runs out and demand remains subdued, companies will begin to consider reducing their workforce, said Shannon Seery, an economist at Wells Fargo. “We’re only seeing a gradual pullback in hiring for manufacturing, even as new demand slows, because these backlogs are still helping sustain activity,” she said. However, she noted: “All of last year we saw the level of outstanding backlog come down, so that and this hit to demand will make firms decide whether to pull back on their capital expenditures, which we’ve already started to see, or begin to lay off workers in an effort to protect profitability.” Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a key measure of business investment, declined in four of the seven months through February, according to data from the Department of Commerce. Overall orders for durable goods, such as appliances, cars and furniture, fell in three of the past four months through February. “New orders are starting to soften and supplier deliveries are improving slightly. This is allowing us to reduce our backlog and build a buffer in some categories,” one electrical equipment and appliances manufacturer said in the ISM’s March survey. Data gauging the manufacturing industry’s health has been mixed. S&P Global’s preliminary manufacturing index for April showed an improvement for the first time in six months, but manufacturers still expressed “some concerns regarding a shift away from goods towards services among customers following the end of the pandemic,” according to the report released on Friday. A survey of manufacturers in the Federal Reserve’s Chicago district showed that activity deteriorated in April from the prior month as the pace of hiring slowed. Respondents said they expect to pull back on hiring over the next 12 months. Manufacturing saw job losses in February for the first time in 21 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There were additional manufacturing job losses in the following month. Already, 3M announced earlier this year that it is cutting 2,500 manufacturing jobs globally because of weakened consumer demand and disruptions in its operations overseas. Dow Inc. also announced thousands of layoffs at the beginning of the year. However, while manufacturing layoffs are expected, they are likely to be limited. Companies are still struggling to hire and, due to a phenomenon known as labor hoarding, they will hesitate to shed workers because of previous difficulty in attracting and retaining talent. “Given how difficult it has been to find labor and keep it, manufacturing companies are going to do everything they can to try to avoid layoffs,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at forecasting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez. “But I think they can only do that for so long, so they will eventually have to bite the bullet and start laying people off.” ",654,economy,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/economy/manufacturing-layoffs-backlogs/index.html

      Jury selected in Ed Sheeran music copyright case
    ","A copyright infringement case against British pop artist Ed Sheeran is set to kick off this week, with the potential to further complicate the legal landscape for songwriters. The jury was selected Monday in the case against Sheeran, who is accused of copying the 1973 soul hit “Let’s Get It On” by the heirs of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song with Marvin Gaye. Jurors will return to Manhattan federal court Tuesday morning when opening statements in the trial are expected to begin. Sheeran is also expected to testify in the trial. The trial concerns Sheeran’s song “Thinking Out Loud,” which won the 2016 Grammy award for song of the year. “The Defendants copied the ‘heart’ of ‘Let’s’ and repeated it continuously throughout ‘Thinking,’” the lawsuit claims. It alleges there are “melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic compositions” in the two songs that are “substantially and/or strikingly similar.” Townsend’s daughter Kathryn Townsend Griffin, sister Helen McDonald and the estate of his former wife, Cherrigale Townsend, are the listed plaintiffs on the “Thinking Out Loud” case. Gaye died in 1984 and Townsend died in 2003. In legal filings, Sheeran’s lawyers have argued that “the alleged similarities between the two songs are actually not similar and that any remaining similarities consist of unprotectable musical elements.” Lawsuits such as the one filed by Gaye’s family have become increasingly common in the music industry over the past few years. Gaye’s family has previously sued other artists for copyright infringement—and won. The estate successfully sued singer Robin Thicke and producer Pharrell Williams for $7.4 million in 2015 for borrowing from Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up” for their hit “Blurred Lines,” though the case turned into a five-year legal battle that ultimately saw the judgment reduced to $5.3 million. The ruling also awarded Gaye’s family 50% percent of the royalties from “Blurred Lines” moving forward. But other, recent copyright cases have had different outcomes. Taylor Swift faced a similar case in 2017 over her smash hit “Shake It Off,” which was settled and dismissed last year. Led Zeppelin was sued in 2014 over its iconic tune “Stairway to Heaven” by the estate of late Randy California, former lead guitarist of the 1960s band Spirit,  for lifting part of their single “Taurus.” A 2020 appeals court ruled in Led Zeppelin’s favor. Sheeran, meanwhile, has faced previous legal battles over his music and won. In a 2022 case over his song “Shape of You,” a judge ruled in Sheeran’s favor that he did not copy grime artist Sami Switch’s song “Oh Why” after the musician accused Sheeran of plagiarizing a key part. He was also sued in 2016 over his single “Photograph,” which was settled out of court. After his successful 2022 legal battle, Sheeran posted a video to his Instagram voicing his concern over the recent wave of music copyright cases. “It’s really damaging to the songwriting industry. There’s only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That’s 22 million songs a year, and there’s only 12 notes that are available,” Sheeran said. “I’m not an entity. I’m not a corporation. I’m a human being. I’m a father. I’m a husband. I’m a son. Lawsuits are not a pleasant experience.” ",551,media,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/media/ed-sheeran-copyright-trial/index.html

      Disney begins largest wave of layoffs, targeting thousands at ESPN, Parks, and other divisions
    ","Disney is laying off several thousand workers across the company this week in the second and largest wave of cuts as part of the media giant’s previously announced plan to slash its workforce by 7,000 employees. The latest round of job cuts will impact ESPN, Disney’s entertainment division, Disney Parks, and its Experiences and Product division as part of a larger workforce reduction plan announced in February by chief executive Bob Iger in an aim to save $5.5 billion in costs, the company said. The company had suspended its dividend payments during the pandemic, but Iger announced in February that he expects them to return. The cuts this week are expected to take place Monday through Thursday, affecting employees from coast to coast, Disney said. The latest round of layoffs comes after an initial wave last month, and will bring the total number of jobs lost across the company to 4,000, it said. The layoffs, however, are not expected to affect hourly frontline employees at Disney’s theme parks and resorts. A third and final wave of layoffs to reach the 7,000 total is expected before the beginning of summer, the company said. Disney had about 220,000 workers as of October 1, of which approximately 166,000 were employed in the United States. A cut of 7,000 jobs represents about 3% of its global workforce. “The difficult reality of many colleagues and friends leaving Disney is not something we take lightly,” Iger said in a memo to staff last month. “In tough moments, we must always do what is required to ensure Disney can continue delivering exceptional entertainment to audiences and guests around the world – now, and long into the future.” The layoffs follow Iger’s return to Disney in November after the company’s board fired Bob Chapek as its leader. CNN’s Chris Isidore contributed. ",303,media,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/media/disney-begin-layoffs/index.html

      Officer who fired fatal shot in Breonna Taylor botched raid hired by a nearby county sheriffs office
    ","Myles Cosgrove, one of the Louisville Metro Police officers involved in the 2020 shooting of Breonna Taylor, has been recently hired by the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office, Cosgrove’s attorney told CNN. The move prompted the family of Breonna Taylor to release a statement expressing “disgust” and “disappointment” the officer who fired the fatal bullet in the botched raid was hired by a sheriff’s office only 50 miles away from Louisville. Cosgrove – the detective whose bullet ultimately killed Taylor according to the Kentucky Attorney General – began working for the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office on April 20, Sheriff Ryan Gosser told CNN affiliate WAVE. The sheriff told WAVE his office did a normal background check prior to hiring Cosgrove, and pointed out Cosgrove was never indicted. Gosser said Cosgrove brings experience which will be useful in the county, WAVE reported. Cosgrove’s attorney Scott Miller said his client was a scapegoat for the shooting death of Taylor. “He has been cleared by a state grand jury, a federal grand jury,” he said adding, “His actions that night, were what police officers are trained to react to when they’re fired upon,” Miller said. “We provided expert testimony that said he acquired sufficient target identification and target isolation. The city didn’t provide any expert testimony. They have nothing in their policy related to that.” Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said Cosgrove was justified because Taylor’s boyfriend fired at officers first. The Louisville Metro Police Department initially terminated Detective Cosgrove in January 2021 for use of deadly force for firing 16 rounds into Taylor’s home and failing to activate his body camera, according to a copy of his termination letter. In December 2021, the Louisville Metro Police Merit Board backed the decision to fire Cosgrove by a 5-2 vote, in a decision made after several days of hearings. Last November, the Kentucky Law Enforcement Council voted not to revoke Cosgrove’s state peace officer certification according to Louisville television station WHAS. The decision meant he could apply for other law enforcement jobs in the state. “The Kentucky law enforcement Council, consisting of citizens, mayors, Judge executives, police officers across the state as well as educators, also voted he should not lose his police officer certification [and] should be allowed to be a police officer in Kentucky,” Miller said. Sam Aguiar, who represents Taylor’s family, said he was “disgusted” when he heard about the hiring. “I was disappointed and disgusted to hear that an agency hired him. We had one of the best ballistics experts in the country review Cosgrove’s actions at length. He concluded without a doubt that Cosgrove shot Breonna continuously while she was unarmed, going to the ground, and on the ground,” Aguiar said. “Even if Carroll County was desperate for a body to fill a position, due diligence should’ve prevented this hire from happening. But we unfortunately know from Breonna’s case and so many others that in the world of policing, lots of undeserved favors are performed for officers simply because of the badge.” When reached, the Louisville Metro Police Department told CNN it had no comment. A protest was called in response to Cosgrove’s appointment outside the sheriff’s office in Carrollton, on Monday, the Carrollton Police Department confirmed to CNN. By midmorning, CNN affiliate WAVE reported, a small turnout of mostly Louisville residents. “We have activated our plans in regard to civil protests. Our agency has coordinated a response with other agencies that serve our city,” Carrollton Police Chief Michael Willhoite said in a statement to CNN. Carrollton Mayor Robb W. Adams addressed the controversial hiring on the city’s Facebook page. “As many of you may know, there has been some unrest in recent days related to a recent hiring at the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office. We do understand that there are groups who plan to come and exercise their right to assemble and peacefully protest this decision,” Adams said. “The City of Carrollton has been closely monitoring the situation and have plans in place to ensure everyone’s safety, although we do not expect any issues.” Meanwhile, Cosgrove, who has already started working for the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office, needs to work two more years to collect on his full retirement benefits, according to his lawyer. “He has a right to pursue a profession. And he’s pursued one for 20 years and done it honorably, up until this point when he was terminated by Louisville as a scapegoat for this entire situation,” Miller said.

      Former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter released from prison after serving time for deadly shooting of Daunte Wright
    ","Former Minnesota officer Kimberly Potter has been released from prison after serving 16 months of a two-year sentence in the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright, whom she shot after mistaking her gun for a Taser during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, according to the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Potter was released from the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Shakopee at 4 a.m. on Monday, the department said, noting the early hour was due to safety concerns and the potential for violent protests outside the facility. Potter was convicted of two counts of manslaughter in the killing of 20-year-old Wright, an unarmed Black man, during a 2021 traffic stop near Minneapolis. Wright was pulled over for having expired tags and for a hanging air freshener. Potter will be on supervised release for the remaining third of her sentence, in accordance with Minnesota law, which doesn’t provide time off for good behavior, the corrections department said. Potter’s supervised release expires in December. Potter’s attorney, Earl Gray, told CNN the former officer with 26 years of experience has no plans to return to Minnesota and will live in Wisconsin. Wright’s mother, Katie, said she was “dreading” Potter’s release and is struggling to find peace. She said she suffered a stroke that left her temporarily with blurred vision following the stress of Potter’s trial and conviction. “Some say I should forgive to be at peace but how can I? I am so angry. She is going to be able to watch her kids have kids and be able to touch them,” Katie Wright told CNN. “I am always scared I am going to forget my son’s voice. It gave us some sense of peace knowing she would not be able to hold her sons. She has two. I can’t hold my son.” She said Potter not being able to serve as a police officer again, due in part to her conviction, has given her “a sense of peace.” “She will never be able to hurt anybody as a police officer again,” Katie Wright said. “That is the only sense of peace we get as a family.” Potter wept when she testified during her 2021 trial, apologizing and insisting she “didn’t want to hurt anybody.” “I was very distraught. I just shot somebody. I’m sorry it happened,” Potter cried as a prosecutor asked her about her behavior moments after the fatal shooting. Potter testified she had been trained with a Taser since 2002 and testified she received a new model days before the April 11, 2021 shooting. The city of Brooklyn Center agreed to pay a $3.25 million settlement to the family of Daunte Wright in June 2022. The Wright family said the payment still has not been distributed due to other unrelated legal disputes but they are “hopeful” to receive payment in the next 90 days. Part of the settlement agreement requires Brooklyn Center Police officers undergo implicit bias training. The city’s newly elected mayor, April Graves, confirmed that training still hasn’t happened, though, she says, it’s in the works. Wright was killed just as the high-profile trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who was ultimately convicted of murdering George Floyd, was underway only about 10 miles away. Floyd’s death spurred outrage across the country with protests in many major cities – as well as some international locales – to decry police brutality and racial injustice. Soon after Wright’s death, the Brooklyn Center City Council approved “The Daunte Wright and Kobe Dimock-Heisler Community Safety and Violence Prevention Resolution,” which said the city would create an unarmed department to handle “all incidents where a city resident is primarily experiencing a medical, mental health, disability-related, or other behavioral or social need.” The resolution, which passed in 2021, was also named after Kobe Dimock-Heisler, a 21-year-old man living with autism, was also killed by Brooklyn Center Police after his family called 911 for help in 2019. The measure also said officers would not be able to make arrests or conduct searches for many lower-level offenses, including stops for non-moving traffic infractions. It was introduced by the city’s former mayor, Mike Elliott. “It was easy to get it passed but we still haven’t implemented anything and here we are two years later,” Katie Wright said. “It is roadblock after roadblock.” Mayor Graves told CNN the city is moving forward but “not as fast” as some in the community would like. She said the resolution “was crafted and written by the former mayor without the input of any staff or council members.” Graves, who was a city council member when the resolution passed in 2021, said the city council, which now has two new members since the killing of Wright, will vote on new recommendations for the policy changes in May. She added that last year the city held two town halls on policy recommendations. Another town hall was held Saturday. “There were some things within that resolution that just weren’t feasible,” Graves said, noting they only have about 35,000 residents and while they have “big city problems,” the council is working with a “small city budget.” “Creating three new departments was just not conceivable,” Graves added. “One of those departments that he called for was around a department of violence prevention or something along those lines. Our new office of community prevention, health and safety is aligned with those things.” Meanwhile, Graves said if the proposed traffic stop changes and consent searches are approved by the city council, officers would not be allowed to pull people over solely for minor traffic offenses, like invalid or expired registration, excessive window tints, and broken headlights or tail lights. She also said the current recommendations allow officers to pull someone over if a minor traffic offense could lead to serious damage. “I think if we’re able to actually vote on and approve these recommendations around consent searches and pre-emptive stops … it would bring down the likelihood of having these issues come up again,” Graves said, adding “community feedback is important.” In the last 18 months, Graves said the city has seen turnover in the police department and other city offices. The department, now led by its first Black chief, Kellace McDaniel, has 42 sworn police officers on patrol. Graves said the department is fully staffed at 49 officers. The city also “lost six out of seven department directors” but was able to rehire for those roles, including an equity and human resources director, Graves said. “When I first started, it was difficult to even have a resolution around racial equity but now, we have funding and staff trying to do that work internally and externally with the community,” Graves said. “I see definite changes. Government is slow. There’s definitely still a lot of obstacles, people’s fear and misunderstanding and, yes, bias getting in the way, but I think we have the right people in place to keep it moving forward.” Katie Wright and her husband, Aubrey, say they will continue to push for change. A red urn holding their son’s ashes sits above a fireplace in their living room. “Changing traffic stops is the only thing that is going to keep people safe. We need it in every city,” Katie Wright said. “I am not going to be quiet.” ",1210,us,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/us/kim-potter-release-prison-daunte-wright/index.html

      9 teens were injured when shots were fired at an after-prom party in Texas. Police say a second shooting may be connected
    ","At least nine teenagers suffered non-life-threatening injuries after shots were fired at an after-prom party in Texas over the weekend – and a second shooting less than 20 minutes away may be connected, authorities said. Deputies from the Jasper County, Texas, Sheriff’s Office responded to a disturbance at a home north of Jasper just after midnight on Sunday, the agency said in a Facebook post. Deputies found nine victims with non-life-threatening injuries, the post  said. The ages of the victims range from 15 to 19, sheriff’s office spokesperson Karli Cherry told CNN in an email Sunday morning. The violence is the latest in a relentless series of shootings in America, many of which have taken the lives of or seriously injured young people. Mass shootings have escalated, occurring at a record pace nationwide. At least 173 have been reported so far this year, leaving more than 225 people dead and at least 675 injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Last weekend, four young people were killed – including a beloved high school football player – and at least 32 others were hurt during a Sweet 16 birthday party in Dadeville, Alabama. The victims’ ages ranged from 17 to 23. At least six people – including four teenagers – have been arrested and face murder charges in the massacre, Alabama authorities have said. Following the Texas after-prom party shooting, at least eight victims were taken to a nearby hospital by personal cars and some victims were transferred to a hospital in Beaumont for further treatment, authorities said. While authorities have not yet identified a motive for the shooting, they are interviewing several witnesses and people of interest, the sheriff’s office said in a Sunday evening news release. The sheriff’s office said it is also investigating another shooting that occurred just miles away, adding there may be a “possible connection” between the two. Authorities did not offer further details about the second incident. Jasper is in eastern Texas, roughly 30 minutes west of the Texas-Louisiana border.

      DoorDash driver in Tampa is kidnapped and sexually battered by a man before she is rescued by family members, police say
    ","A woman delivering for DoorDash in Florida was attacked and kidnapped before being rescued by her family members, police say, and a male suspect has been arrested. The driver was trying to make a delivery to the Residence Inn in Tampa at night on April 18 when she was approached by an armed man – identified as 38-year-old Joseph Killins – who forced her back into her car at gunpoint and made her drive to another location more than 6 miles away, where he sexually battered her, the Tampa Police Department said in a news release. When the man first confronted the delivery driver, the victim had her AirPods in her ears and was on the phone with her girlfriend, who realized a robbery was taking place, police said in their initial news release. Family members then called police, and officers were dispatched to the hotel. The victim’s family, who had been tracking her phone, arrived at her location and rescued her from the car, authorities said. The suspect “responded by firing multiple times, with one shot striking a family member of the victim’s girlfriend, a female in her 20s, before fleeing the scene,” Tampa police said in a news release. Both victims were taken to a nearby hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. The next morning, Killins allegedly threw a woman to the ground at an apartment complex, punched her and stole her backpack, according to Tampa police. Detectives investigating the alleged robbery were led to Killins’ location at the Tampa Inn and “items related to the April 18 investigation were recovered,” police said. Killins was then arrested late Friday night and charged with the DoorDash delivery driver’s kidnapping and battery, among others. “This criminal is now off the streets thanks to the tireless efforts of every Tampa Police Department employee and the assistance provided by members of our community,” Interim Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw said. “My thoughts remain with the victims. I hope this arrest brings them a sense of comfort knowing that he will now face justice for the crimes he chose to commit.” Killins was charged with armed kidnapping, robbery with a firearm, armed sexual battery and aggravated battery with a weapon in the April 18 incident, authorities said. He also faces another robbery charge for the April 19 incident, according to police. “We are appalled by this heinous and abhorrent crime,” DoorDash spokesperson Julian Crowley said in a statement. “No one should ever have to endure something as horrific as this and we’re here to support the Dasher in any way we can. We’re grateful to Tampa Police for their work to hold the perpetrator accountable and we strongly hope justice is served.” ",452,us,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/us/tampa-doordash-driver-kidnapped-sexually-battered/index.html

      Death toll in Kenyan starvation cult rises to 58, police say
    ","Kenyan police have recovered 58 bodies from mass graves in the Shakahola forest in eastern Kenya, thought to be followers of a Christian cult who believed they would go to heaven if they starved themselves, the country’s police chief said on Monday. The death toll, which has been rising steadily over the past two days as exhumations have been carried out, could rise further as the Kenyan Red Cross has said 112 people have been reported missing to a tracing desk it operates. The cult was called the Good News International Church and its leader, Paul Mackenzie, was arrested following a tip-off that suggested the existence of shallow graves containing the bodies of at least 31 of his followers. Police near the coastal town of Malindi started exhuming bodies on Friday from the Shakahola forest. Earlier this month, police rescued 15 members of the group – worshippers at the church – who they said had been told to starve themselves to death. Four of them died before they reached hospital, police said. Local media, citing police sources, reported that Mackenzie has refused to eat or drink while in police custody. Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the entire 800 acre forest had been sealed off and declared a scene of crime. “This horrendous blight on our conscience must lead not only to the most severe punishment of the perpetrator(s) of the atrocity on so many innocent souls, but tighter regulation (including self-regulation) of every church, mosque, temple or synagogue going forward,” he said.

      Rival generals are battling for control in Sudan. Here’s a simple guide to the fighting
    ","Fierce fighting across Sudan has left hopes for a peaceful transition to civilian rule in tatters. Forces loyal to two rival generals are vying for control, and as is so often the case civilians have suffered the most, with dozens killed and hundreds injured. Doctors’ organizations and several eyewitnesses said medical facilities were being bombarded with military strikes in targeted attacks, as clashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary ramped up for the third day. Both sides later denied shelling hospitals, in comments to CNN. Here’s what you need to know. At the heart of the clashes are two men: Sudan’s military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. Until recently, they were allies. The pair worked together to topple ousted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and played a pivotal role in the military coup in 2021. However, tensions arose during negotiations to integrate the RSF into the country’s military as part of plans to restore civilian rule. The key question: who would be subordinate to who under the new hierarchy. These hostilities, sources told CNN, are the culmination of what both parties view as an existential fight for dominance. It is difficult to overstate how seismic Bashir’s overthrow was. He had led the country for nearly three decades when popular protests that began over soaring bread prices toppled him from power. During his rule, South Sudan split from the north while the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Bashir alleged war crimes in Darfur, a separatist Western region. After Bashir’s ouster, Sudan was ruled by an uneasy alliance between the military and civilian groups. That all ended in 2021, when the power-sharing government was dissolved by armed forces. The Rapid Support Forces are the preeminent paramilitary group in Sudan, whose leader, Dagalo, has enjoyed a rapid rise to power. During Sudan’s Darfur conflict in the early 2000s, he was the leader of Sudan’s notorious Janjaweed forces, implicated in human rights violations and atrocities. An international outcry saw Bashir formalize the group into paramilitary forces known as the Border Intelligence Units. In 2007, its troops became part of the country’s intelligence services and, in 2013, Bashir created the RSF, a paramilitary group overseen by him and led by Dagalo. Dagalo turned against Bashir in 2019, but not before his forces opened fire on an anti-Bashir, pro-democracy sit-in in Khartoum, killing at least 118 people. He was later appointed deputy of the transitional Sovereign Council that ruled Sudan in partnership with civilian leadership. Burhan is essentially Sudan’s leader. At the time of Bashir’s toppling, Burhan was the army’s inspector general. His career has run an almost parallel course to Dagalo’s. He also rose to prominence in the 2000’s for his role in the dark days of the Darfur conflict, where the two men are believed to have first came into contact. Al-Burhan and Dagalo both cemented their rise to power by currying favor with the Gulf powerhouses. They commanded separate battalions of Sudanese forces, who were sent to serve with the Saudi-led coalition forces in Yemen. Now they find themselves locked in a power struggle. Speaking with CNN, Burhan, characterized the RSF offensive as an “attempted coup.” “This is an attempted coup and rebellion against the state,” Burhan told CNN by phone. He said that RSF leader Dagalo had “mutinied” against the state, and if captured, would be tried in court of law. Burhan alleged in the CNN interview that the RSF had tried to “capture me and kill me.” When asked about that claim, an RSF spokesperson told CNN that the group was “seeking to capture him” and bring him to justice for “many treasons acts against the Sudanese people.” “We are fighting for all Sudanese people,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We [are] going to bring all responsible parties to justice and give them a fair trial.” When challenged on why the Sudanese people should trust him, given his former alliance with Dagalo, Burhan told CNN: “The Sudanese Army is the people’s army. “It is not owned by specific people or specific organizations,” he said. “It is a national institution, which is tasked with defending Sudan.” Where the fighting will end is unclear. Both sides claim control over key sites and fighting has been reported across the country in places far from the capital Khartoum. While various official and non-official estimates place the Sudanese armed forces at around 210-220,000, the RSF are believed to number approximately 70,000 but are better trained and better equipped. International powers have expressed alarm, with the UN Security Council holding its first meeting on the crisis in Sudan on Monday. Apart from concerns over civilians there are likely other motivations at play – Sudan is resource-rich and strategically located. CNN has previously reported on how Russia has colluded with Sudan’s military leaders to smuggle gold out of Sudan. Dagalo’s forces were a key recipient of Russian training and weaponry, and Sudan’s military leader Burhan is also believed by CNN’s Sudanese sources to have been backed by Russia, before international pressure forced him to publicly disavow the presence of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, in Sudan. Sudan’s neighbors Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate, but in the meantime all that is certain is more misery for the Sudanese people.

      ‘Beautiful lioness’ spotted in Chad’s Sena Oura National Park for first time in almost 20 years
    ","After a two-decade absence, at least one lion has returned to Chad’s Sena Oura National Park. An image of a “muscular female lion” in the park was captured by a remote camera in February, according to a news release from the Wildlife Conservation Society, which released the image on Thursday in collaboration with the government of Chad. Lions haven’t been spotted in the park for almost 20 years, says the news release. The conservationists who released the image described the big cat as “a beautiful lioness, in her prime and clearly in great health” in the release. Lions are considered extinct in Sena Oura, located near Chad’s border with Cameroon, by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The border region between Chad and Cameroon “saw a period of ruthless, organized poaching more than a decade ago, but has since benefited from a very strong commitment to conservation by the governments of both Cameroon and Chad,” the Wildlife Conservation Society said in the news release. “This has produced better protection of the national parks and wildlife populations are now starting to recover,” it added. Lions are categorized as “Vulnerable” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, with between 23,000 and 39,000 of the big cats left in the wild. Their populations are especially “small and fragmented” in west and central Africa, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Killing by humans, habitat loss, and the loss of their prey have all contributed to the population’s decline.

      First evacuations of foreign nationals stuck in Sudan announced
    ","Saudi Arabia has become the first country to announce evacuations of its stranded citizens from Sudan, a week after intense fighting broke out there between two rival forces. The Saudi foreign ministry said “several nationals of brotherly and friendly countries” were being evacuated along with the Saudi citizens. Kuwaiti citizens are among the dozens of people brought to safety but it is not clear which other nationals are involved. The announcement came after both the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said they were ready to help evacuate foreign nationals. The SAF said in a statement Saturday that its leader, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has “agreed to provide the necessary assistance” to facilitate the safe evacuation of foreign citizens from the country in response to “calls from a number of heads of states.” “The evacuation of all missions whose countries made such a request is expected to begin within the coming hours, as the United States, the UK, France, and China will evacuate their diplomats and nationals by air by military transport aircrafts belonging to their respective armed forces from Khartoum and this is expected to begin immediately,” the SAF said in the statement, posted on its Facebook page. According to a list released by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, 91 of its citizens had been evacuated, along with 66 nationals from 12 other countries which included Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Tunisia, Pakistan, India, Bulgaria, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Canada, and Burkina Faso. It did not provide an exact breakdown of how many evacuees came from each of the countries it listed. Kuwait thanked Saudi Arabia for evacuating its citizens from Sudan to Jeddah,  in a statement released by its foreign ministry on Saturday. But it did not specify how many Kuwaiti nationals had been evacuated. Iraq’s Foreign Affairs Ministry told CNN via phone that there had been a “special operation” to evacuate its diplomats from their embassy in the capital Khartoum. Ministry spokesperson Ahmad al-Sahaaf said the diplomats had been moved to “a safe place in Sudan” following the operation, but declined to give further details. The developments came as the United States evacuated government personnel in an operation involving special forces. The mission was led by US Africa Command and conducted in close coordination with the State Department, said Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense. Fierce fighting broke out in Sudan last Saturday between the SAF and the paramilitary RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. The two are former allies but tensions between them arose during negotiations to integrate the RSF into the country’s military as part of plans to restore civilian rule. More than 420 people have been killed and 3,700 injured in the fighting, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and on the ground the humanitarian situation is worsening. The UN says people are increasingly fleeing areas hit by fighting, including Khartoum. Up to 20,000 refugees have arrived in neighboring Chad, the UN says. On Saturday, fresh clashes between the two groups shattered a three-day ceasefire declared for the Muslim holiday of Eid. Fighting was reported in Khartoum on Saturday, with witnesses telling CNN fierce clashes were taking place in the vicinity of the presidential palace and the sounds of explosions and warplanes flying overhead could be heard. Dagalo said he spoke to French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna on Saturday and they discussed “the current situation, the reasons [that] led to the exacerbation of the situation” and the possibility of opening evacuation corridors. Also on Saturday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak chaired an emergency meeting to discuss the situation. CNN has learned that British evacuation efforts  will not be happening imminently, but a government spokesperson told CNN they were doing “everything possible” to support British nationals. A spokesperson for the European Union said that an estimated 1,500 citizens from various EU countries are currently in Sudan. “They are facing a very difficult situation and their safety is a priority. We urge both sides (the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces) to stop fighting and allow for safe passage out of the country,” the spokesperson said, adding the EU was working with member states to find solutions and get these people out of the country. It is unclear how many US citizens are in Sudan. The State Department does not keep official counts of US citizens in foreign countries and Americans are not required to register when they go abroad. US State Department officials told staffers estimated 16,000 American citizens in Sudan, most of whom are dual nationals. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

      ‘I’m tired. I’m just really, really tired.’ One woman describes living through Sudan’s crisis
    ","Two men are battling for control in Sudan, but stuck in the middle are the country’s people. Hundreds have died, tens of thousands have fled. Residents have been stranded at home and in shelters without food or water, and petrol has become an increasingly important commodity. Since the fighting began last Saturday, CNN has been regularly in touch with Iman Abu Garjah, a British-Sudanese doctor who became stuck while visiting family to celebrate Ramadan. We got this update from her on Friday. Her words have been edited for clarity. “I’m tired. I’m just really, really tired. Exhausted is the right word for it; burnt out. There’s just so much adrenaline. “We were happy about the 24-hour ceasefire [earlier in the week], which was extended, not because there actually was a ceasefire, but there was spacing out between the attacks. “[On Thursday] we all just felt really tired, we were still fasting in the midst of all of this, and everybody’s sentiment was Ramadan just has to come to an end. “I prepared supper, made some sunny side up eggs, trying to make something nice out of a can of tuna. I tried to moisten some stale bread. “Very late at night, we heard, I don’t know what they were, missiles maybe? “My dad has quite limited mobility because he’s sick. He’s been lying sleeping on this sofa bed. We just had to just push him from the living room where he has been sleeping to a safer area where there was a wall covering rather than just windows. “My cousin is also with us. My daughter was absolutely mortified and just inconsolable. My 96-year-old grandmother was in a room behind the place we were sheltering in. She could hear the shelling, she can feel the shaking, the sound coming into the house but I downplayed it for her. My mother was there as well. My sister. “We also have with us domestic helpers. There’s one from Kenya. She’s not Muslim so I started reading the Lord’s Prayer with her. I thought maybe it will bring her some solace and reassurance to know that she’s not alone. “We also have a couple of Ethiopian house helpers, and they were very scared. I kept thinking to myself, these poor people, they flee their countries to come to a place like Sudan, far from their families, to make money to send to them or to go to a safer place and this is what happens to them. It just seems so so unfair. “I think there were two or three very very loud thuds that were very close to the house. We just started reading [the] Quran, praying that we were going to be safe trying to calm the children. I wish I was an octopus so [I] have more hands, hands and arms to put around people just to hug them. “[Friday] has been a blur. I didn’t hear any of the Eid call to prayers, which is one of the things that usually fills me with a lot of joy. It’s one of the main reasons I came from the UK because I just wanted to have a nice fast with family and here it is. All the Eid clothes are in the bag. The nail polish, the hair stuff. I didn’t even put my mascara on. So it’s a really sad day. “A lot of people are fleeing. There are a lot of people offering places on buses to go to Egypt. Ours is a logistical nightmare. It’s a big family and each person or each group of people or household has different requirements. Moving [my grandmother] is not going to be like moving my eight-year-old nephew. “My brother’s daughter has certain health needs, she needs access to certain medications. My mother, my father, my grandmother and my sister, they also would all feel very poorly, or maybe not even survive if they don’t have their medications. “We try to be positive. We try to play games, we try to watch movies, but our attention span has just completely gone. No one can sit and watch a movie. “I focus on the good stuff: we have oil, we have electricity, we have running water because the water tank is working. We have cars in the driveway but no petrol for them. “I’m avoiding the news. Statements by both parties seem to have the same author: I am your saviour and victor. I know they are both untruthful, manipulative, blood thirsty men with no regard for the dignity nor lives of the people they are paid to serve and protect.

      Exclusive: Evidence emerges of Russia’s Wagner arming militia leader battling Sudan’s army
    ","The Russian mercenary group Wagner has been supplying Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces with missiles to aid their fight against the country’s army, Sudanese and regional diplomatic sources have told CNN. The sources said the surface-to-air missiles have significantly buttressed RSF paramilitary fighters and their leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as he battles for power with Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s military ruler and the head of its armed forces. In bordering Libya, where a Wagner-backed rogue general, Khalifa Haftar, controls swathes of land, satellite imagery supports these claims, showing an unusual uptick in activity on Wagner bases. The powerful Russian mercenary group has played a public and pivotal role in Moscow’s foreign military campaigns, namely in Ukraine, and has repeatedly been accused of committing atrocities. In Africa, it has helped to prop up Moscow’s growing influence and seizing of resources. Dagalo and Burhan had been jockeying for power in negotiations over restoring civilian leadership in Sudan before talks broke down, erupting into some of the worst violence the country has seen in decades. The fighting has claimed hundreds of lives and deprived millions of people from electricity, water and food. Satellite images analyzed by CNN and open-source group “All Eyes on Wagner” show one Russian transport plane shuttling between two key Libyan airbases belonging to Haftar and used by the sanctioned Russian fighting group. Haftar has backed the RSF, sources say, although he denies taking sides. And increased Wagner activity at Haftar’s bases, combined with claims by Sudanese and regional diplomatic sources, suggests that both Russia and the Libyan general may have been preparing to support the RSF even before the eruption of violence. The uptick in movement by the Ilyushin-76 transport aircraft started two days before the conflict in Sudan began on Saturday, and continued until at least Wednesday, according to satellite images and Netherlands-based open-source specialist Gerjon. That plane, one of a class of aircraft known by the NATO designation Candid, flew from Haftar’s Khadim airbase in Libya to the Syrian coastal city of Latakia – where Russia has a major airbase – on Thursday, April 13. The next day, it flew from Latakia back to Khadim. The day after that,  it flew again to another Haftar airbase in Libya’s Jufra. It parked in a secluded area, something flight tracker Gerjon considered highly unusual. This was the day the conflict erupted. The transport plane returned to Latakia on Tuesday before flying back to the Libyan militia airbase of Khadim and then to Jufra, according to Gerjon’s research.  That day, Russia airdropped surface-to-air missiles to Dagalo’s militia positions in northwest Sudan, according to regional and Sudanese sources. For years, Dagalo has been a key beneficiary from Russian involvement in Sudan, as the primary recipient of Moscow’s weapons and training. A July 2022 CNN investigation exposed deepening ties between Moscow and Sudan’s military leadership, who granted Russia access to the east African country’s gold riches in exchange for military and political support. The relationship began in earnest after Moscow’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, when Russia began to eye African gold riches as an avenue to circumvent a slew of Western sanctions. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the wave of sanctions that followed accelerated Russia’s gold plunder in Sudan and further propped up military rule, increasing Wagner activity in the country. On the day before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Dagalo headed a Sudanese delegation in Moscow to “advance relations” between the two countries. Burhan and the Sudanese army also previously received backing from Russia. Burhan and Dagalo were allies before the start of the fighting. Together they led coups in 2019 and 2021. Both leaders were also previously backed by the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Both Middle Eastern powerhouses have called for calm in Sudan, amid fears of broader regional repercussions. Yet foreign actors are already beginning to intervene in the conflict. Egypt has a long-standing relationship with Burhan and has privately backed him in the power struggle, according to Sudanese and regional diplomatic sources. A group of Egyptian soldiers were captured by the RSF at a military airport in northern Sudan on the first day of the violence, and released days later. In a statement to CNN, the RSF denied receiving aid from Russia and Libya. It reiterated its denial on Friday and alleged that its rival, al-Burhan’s Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), had aligned itself “with these foreign forces, not RSF.” CNN has reached out to SAF for comment. Russian Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin denied any involvement in the conflict. “Let me reiterate once more: Wagner PMC is in no way involved in the Sudanese conflict,” Prigozhin said on the group’s official Telegram Channel. “Questions from the media about any assistance to General Daglo, or Al-Burhan, or any other individuals in Sudan are nothing more than an attempt at provocation.” Haftar has yet to respond to CNN’s requests for comment.

      Brazil’s Lula pitches ‘peace coalition’ for Ukraine, but he treads a thin line
    ","Calling for peace in Ukraine from thousands of miles away, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been trying to position himself as a possible mediating force in the conflict for months now. Without offering much detail on the plan, Lula, as he is known, seems to be fully embodying his government’s line that “Brazil is back” — that is, back to claim a role in global politics. He says he aims to form a coalition of countries willing to intervene and lead efforts for peace in Ukraine, though in the process is finding himself treading a thin line with the world’s biggest powers. Lula’s proposal is to create “a G20 for peace” – a group of countries strong enough to be respected at the negotiating table, but that are still considered by some as neutral in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Indonesia, India, and China would play a crucial role in his vision, but Latin American countries are also invited to join the apparent initiative. When he launched his political comeback in 2022, Lula told Time magazine that he thought both Russia and Ukraine were responsible for the conflict. Lula condemned Russia’s decision to invade its neighbor, but controversially claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could have done more to avoid the conflict. Once in office, he insisted that Brazil would not take a side. But when German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz recently encouraged Brazil to contribute weapons to Ukraine’s defense, Lula felt compelled to do something, explains Guilherme Casarões, political scientist and professor at Fundação Getúlio Vargas’ Public Administration School. “He was sitting on the fence, he was very comfortable where he was, and now he had to get off the fence,” Casarões said. Lula could not contemplate sending weapons – a step that would go far beyond Brazil’s traditional foreign policy, suggested the analyst. “No Brazilian administration, not even Bolsonaro’s, I’d say, would send weapons to Ukraine. Brazil doesn’t engage in wars we have nothing to do with, Brazil doesn’t participate unless it’s a world war of sorts,” Casarões said. But he couldn’t do nothing, either – after all, Lula had promised to bring Brazil “back” to the world stage. “He could have just said ‘no’, but he did not,” says Casarões. “Instead he said, ‘Ok I’m not sending weapons to Ukraine but let’s try to broker peace, let’s use Brazil’s reputation and my own skills as a mediator to allow for a peace summit to take place, let’s try to work it out. If I am to take sides, let me take the side of dialogue’.” The United States, France, and Germany have heard Lula’s pitch to create a team of peacemakers. Lula has also broached the idea with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but left Beijing earlier this month without any formal commitment. Lula has struggled to make his proposal widely persuasive. One controversial idea that he has floated for a possible resolution would see Ukraine cede Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 – a concession that Kyiv has ruled out and which the White House has described as “simply misguided.” Lula’s shoot-from-the-hip approach to consensus-building has also been rocky. Until recently, the US – a close ally to Kyiv – had largely kept quiet about Lula’s comments on Ukraine. But while still in Beijing last week, Lula took aim directly at Washington, who along with the EU have been major suppliers of defensive arms and aid to Ukraine. Lula told reporters the US should stop “encouraging” the war “and start talking about peace”  – a comment that drew praise from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and anger from Washington. Two days later, US National Security spokesman John Kirby accused Brazil of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda.” It is “deeply problematic how Brazil has substantively and rhetorically approached this issue by suggesting that the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war,” Kirby said. “Quite frankly, in this case, Brazil was parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda without at all looking at the facts.” Chastised, Lula later seemed to soften his tone; during a speech at the occasion of the visit of the president of Romania the very next day, the Brazilian leader emphasized that his government “condemns the violation of territorial integrity of Ukraine” and at the same time “defend[s] a negotiated political solution.” To do otherwise would risk isolating Brazil from its friends and trading partners in the West, experts told CNN. “If we are in this environment of saying we condemn Russia’s aggression and we will try to find solutions for peace together, then yes, of course we will value Brazil’s efforts,” said Ambassador of the European Union to Brazil, Ignacio Ybáñez, told CNN Brasil Tuesday. “Where we start having some difficulty understanding the ideas of the Brazilian government is precisely when they place the attacker and the attacked on the same level,” he said. Lula needs to hone his message and show his willingness to engage with Ukraine now if he hopes to maintain credibility in Europe and the US, and to ultimately claim any credit for peacemaking, says Casarões. “Lula hasn’t really thought about what kinds of things he was going to say, in this effort of building this unaligned position,” he said. “If Lula keeps on reaffirming that Russia and Ukraine are equally responsible for the war, I think that his capital is going to wane at some point, so it’s important for Lula to take a step back, maybe reconsider some of the things that he has said on the war, and maybe change the way he puts it, even if slightly. I think that will be enough for people to understand where Brazil really stands.” He suggests that Lula could invite a Ukrainian delegation to Brasilia, to match Lavrov’s visit last week. “Let’s show them that we are really willing, really committed to talking to both sides,” Casarões says. As of Friday, Lula had asked foreign policy adviser and former foreign minister Celso Amorim to travel to Ukraine, although no date has been set for the trip. Amorim also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month in Moscow. But Lula’s position will remain complicated as he attempts to protect Brazil’s economic interest while catapulting himself into a fraught geopolitical arena. China is Brazil’s biggest trading partner and a major buyer of Brazilian soy and beef. For both of these commodities, Brazilian farmers also depend on Russian fertilizers. The economic and diplomatic agendas could come crashing down, if he slips. Andre Pagliarini, assistant professor of history at Hampden-Sydney College and a non-resident fellow at the Washington Brazil Office and Quincy Institute, says China is ultimately part of the reason why a Lula-brokered peace deal is unlikely to take shape. “China, like Brazil, has an interest in getting Russia to end the war. Unlike Brazil, however, it has the ability to force Putin’s hand and unlike Brazil has no interest in sharing credit for peace,” Pagliarini said. As Lula continues his world tour of “Brazil is back”, he also faces a variety of challenges at home — from the firing of his chief of security over leaked video of the January 8 riots in Brasilia, to the growing political threat of Brazil’s radical right. His country’s economy is shrinking and inflation is rising; indigenous communities in the Amazon are in crisis; and food security haunts the nation. A strategy of maintaining Brazil’s tradition of nonalignment and charting an independent path from the great global powers could be good for both him and for Brazilians. The government’s view is that the sanctions imposed on Russia by the US, Japan, and EU countries have severely disrupted global commerce and agriculture, and this impact is outsized for developing countries whose economies are still reeling from a pandemic – Brazil included. There is a chance Brazil can look good brokering peace while still doing what is best for its own economic growth – but the stakes are high. “If it can deliver real material gains for Brazilians, I think it’ll be considered a success,” Pagliarini says. “If living standards don’t improve for Brazilians, however, Lula’s foreign policy will likely play into a narrative that he is too old and backward to lead Brazil into the next decade.” ",1384,americas,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/americas/brazil-lula-ukraine-peace-coalition-intl-latam/index.html

      New CCTV footage fuels debate over January 8 riots in Brazil
    ","A man dressed in the yellow and green of the Brazilian flag walks towards a glass table inside the Planalto Presidential Palace in Brasilia with a metal rod in his hand. In one decisive swoop he swings it towards the table, shattering it to pieces. The moment — one of many supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro ransacked the seat of the Brazilian presidency on January 8 — was captured on new CCTV footage, exclusively obtained by CNN affiliate CNN Brasil. The footage provides new insight into one of the darkest days in in the life of Brazil’s young democracy. It also appears to bolster the claims of those who accused police of failing to act to stop protesters from breaking into the Presidential Palace, among other government buildings. Days after the incident, President Lula da Silva said he believed that some police had colluded with protesters, alleging political bias among security forces. “There were a lot of people colluding, it’s important to say, there were a lot of conniving people from the military police, there were a lot of conniving people from the armed forces,” he told journalists at the Presidential Palace on January 12. The newly obtained footage shows police forces seemingly retreating as supporters of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who was ousted in a vote last fall – march on the palace. Some police support vehicles drive away and groups of police with riot shields appear to disperse. Inside, security is seen locking the main glass door of the Palace, but then seemingly moving away as rioters enter the building. Once they, do the ransacking begins; protesters can be seen breaking antique clocks, smashing tables, phones and nearly everything else they can get their hands on. Former policeman and public security researcher Cassio Thyone says that some officers may have conducted themselves inappropriately, possibly believing that the protestors could not break in. “I don’t believe it was incompetence, maybe some negligence. It wasn’t all of them but some police officers ended up thinking there was no risk of an invasion,” Thyone said. The Institutional Security Office, known as GSI, which advises the president on security matters and handles law enforcement and security personnel tasked with safeguarding Presidential Palaces and their staff, said its officers were being investigated, but defended their conduct as an attempt to strategically concentrate demonstrators onto a single floor to arrest them. “The GSI states that the images show the performance of security officers, which was, at first, with the intent of evacuating the fourth and third floors of the Planalto Palace, concentrating the demonstrators on the second floor, where, after waiting for the reinforcement of the military police riot squad, it would be possible to arrest them,” the GSI said in a statement on Wednesday. “It must be known that the conduct of the GSI public officers involved is being investigated in an inquiry initiated within the scope of this Ministry and if irregular conduct is proven, the corresponding authors will be held responsible,” it also said. Conspiracy theorists on Brazil’s right have seized on the new footage. At the time of the riots, many in the opposition argued the incidents had actually helped cement Lula’s leadership and claimed, without evidence, that the government had set police up to fail for that exact reason. Bolsonaro’s party — the Brazilian Liberal Party — has used the footage to once again call for a parliamentary inquiry into the incident, tying the incidents to Lula and his government. “We need justice and transparency to identify the real culprits,” the party tweeted on Wednesday. Brazil’s Minister for Institutional Relations Alexandre Padilha has also said that the current government supports an inquiry. Speaking to journalists on Thursday in Brasilia, Padilha also said that the footage had created “a new political situation” that risked bolstering unfounded theories about the insurrection. “[This footage] has created a new political situation, which makes those that tried to sweep the terrorists acts of January 8 under the rug try to create an absurd conspiracy theory, a real bulldozing, the theory they try to build is that the victims of those terrorist acts had responsibility over the behaviour of the terrorists of January 8.” The minister in charge of the GSI, General Marcos Gonçalves Dias, resigned this week, after critics raised questions over new CCTV footage that showed him walking alongside some of the rioters just feet away from the Presidential office. Minutes later, the same camera captures military officers greeting rioters and handing out bottles of water. When asked about his particular role, Dias – a long-time ally and friend of President Lula – denied that he was colluding with the protesters. “To liken my behaviour to that Major distributing waters to protesters is absurd,” he told Brazilian broadcaster Globo. “I entered the Palace after the Palace had been broken into, and I was taking people out of the third and fourth floor, to the second floor, so that they could be arrested.” Leaving more questions than answers, the video has added fuel to both sides of a fiery division still plaguing Brazilian politics.

      US President Joe Biden pledges $500 million to curb Amazon deforestation
    ","United States President Joe Biden pledged a $500 million investment to the Amazon Fund on Thursday, a sum that would make his country one of the world’s largest donors to the international conservation program to protect the Amazon rainforest from deforestation. “Today, I’m pleased to announce that I will request the funds so that we can contribute $500 million to the Amazon Fund and other climate-related activities over the next five years to support Brazil’s renewed effort to end deforestation by 2030,” Biden said during a virtual meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. The Amazon Fund uses foreign funds for projects that fight deforestation and preserve the environment in the Amazon, and was set up in Brazil during President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s previous term in office. Major donors include Norway and Germany. During the presidency of former Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, the fund was left untouched while then-environmental minister Ricardo Salles dissolved committees responsible for managing the resource. Lula has touted curbing deforestation of the Amazon as a top priority since becoming president earlier this year. Biden also promised a $1 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund, which is the main climate financing mechanism of the United Nations. “We’re at a moment of great peril but also great possibilities, serious possibilities.  With the right commitment and follow-through from every nation on the — in this room, in this — on this call, the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees can stay within reach,” Biden added. The announcement comes the same day Biden welcomed Colombian President Gustavo Petro to the White House, saying he considers Colombia “the key to the hemisphere,” in efforts to ensure the Western Hemisphere is “united, equal, democratic, and economically prosperous.” At Thursday’s Oval office meeting with Petro, Biden also spoke to efforts to combat narcotics trafficking in the region, and “to address historic levels of migration in the hemisphere.” Biden touted the $500 million investment to the Amazon Fund as part of the two nations’ efforts to deal with climate change.” And he took special care to thank Petro “for the hospitality support Colombia continues to show to Venezuelan refugees.” “It’s a humanitarian and generous thing that you’re doing,” he added. “You know we’re working closely with regional partners to help Columbia meet this challenge. It’s consequential and costly.” Petro noted that the United States and Colombia have a shared commitment to democracy, freedom and peace together with a strong push for decarbonizing the economy. “In the Americas, humanity has the greatest potential for democracy and freedom and the greatest potential for carbon free energy. We have a busy agenda together and work to do,” Petro stated. Petro is in Washington as part of a five-day trip to the US to celebrate the 200th anniversary of US-Colombia relations. He held talks at the United Nations and the Organization of American States and visited Capitol Hill to meet with congressmen in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

      Zelensky speaks to Mexican lawmakers as Ukraine and Russia turn toward the Americas
    ","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday appealed to Mexico’s Congress for support in the war against Russia, as both Kyiv and Moscow seek to reinforce ties in the Americas. “Your vote in the UN General Assembly and other international organizations is very important. It is the vote to defend the principles and objectives of the UN Charter and therefore to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine and all nations of the world,” Zelensky told Mexican lawmakers in his speech, via video-link, that received a standing ovation. Zelensky’s appeal comes after many Latin American countries have adopted a policy of non-intervention over the war in Ukraine, rebuffing efforts led by United States President Joe Biden to unite the global community in opposition to Russia’s invasion. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has raised eyebrows among Ukraine supporters for criticizing Western arms shipments into Kyiv. Still, Mexico has voted alongside the United States in UN resolutions calling for Russia to leave Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has meanwhile been on a trip around Latin America in a bid to strengthen ties with regional allies, stopping in Havana, Cuba, on Thursday. Earlier in the week, Lavrov met with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has criticized US military assistance to Ukraine as “encouraging war” – words that White House national security spokesperson John Kirby later described as “deeply problematic” for “suggesting that the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war.” “Quite frankly, in this case, Brazil was parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda without at all looking at the facts,” Kirby said Monday. China, an increasingly close ally to Russia, is Brazil’s greatest trading partner. Lula recently returned from a multi-day trip to Shanghai and Beijing, where he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The two leaders discussed forming a group of like-minded leaders on Ukraine, according to Lula. The Brazilian President has sought be a global statesman who could broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine, and controversially suggested Kyiv should relinquish sovereignty claims over Crimea in exchange to the end of the conflict. That’s a view Kirby on Monday described as “simply misguided – especially for a country like Brazil, which has voted to uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, quite frankly, at the UN General Assembly.” Zelensky has ruled out peace talks as long as Putin remains in power.

      Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel wins a second term
    ","Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel was given a second five year term by the country’s National Assembly on Wednesday, despite the severe economic conditions currently faced by the communist-run island. Diaz-Canel’s reelection by the 470 member Assembly was widely expected. He replaced Raul Castro as president in 2018 and as First Secretary of the Cuban communist party in 2021. He is the first person born after the 1959 revolution and not named Castro to hold both of those powerful titles. While officially retired, Raul Castro still retains a seat in the National Assembly and the title of Army General. He is considered to wield great influence on affairs of state from behind the scenes. Since taking office, Diaz-Canel, a 62-year-old electrical engineer by training, has faced a succession of calamities that pushed Cuba even nearer to the brink of economic collapse. Following the Obama administration’s policy of rapprochement with Cuba, former President Donald Trump abruptly reversed course, implementing some of the toughest economic sanctions in decades. Then the pandemic all but closed Cuba to tourism, exacerbating already widespread food and medicine shortages. On July 11, 2021, thousands of Cubans, angry over blackouts, lack of personal freedoms and worsening living conditions took to the streets in the largest anti-government protests since the Cuban revolution. Within hours, Diaz-Canel appeared on state-run TV and gave supporters what he called “the order to combat,” saying, “the streets belong to the revolutionaries.” Hundreds of Cubans were arrested and put on mass trial. Diaz-Canel said the protestors were pawns of the US, part of a plot to bring down the Cuban government. The Biden administration responded with additional economic sanctions and has called on Diaz-Canel to release the prisoners. “The sanctions hurt but serve as a scapegoat for the economic problems,” former Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told CNN. “They enhance the idea that this is a city under siege, that this is a country under siege. There are many ways that Americans would look at this: ‘rally around the flag,’ ‘circle the wagons,’ so the Cuban government is very good at doing that.” Following his election, Díaz-Canel announced the ministers of his government who remained largely the same. By law, presidents of Cuba are restricted to two five-year terms and are required to begin their terms before turning 60. But the lack of any major changes or new faces in the upper levels of government on Wednesday meant there is still no hint of a designated successor for Díaz-Canel.

      Australia unveils biggest defense overhaul in decades with wary eye on China
    ","Australia has unveiled a radical shakeup of its defense spending billed as the most significant review of its military preparedness since World War II, shifting its emphasis onto long-range strike capabilities and building munitions at home. Launching the Defense Strategic Review in Canberra, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government’s strategy was designed to make Australia more self reliant, more prepared and more secure. “We cannot fall back on old assumptions. We must build and strengthen our security by seeking to shape the future rather than waiting for the future to shape us,” Albanese said. The review examined billions of dollars committed by the previous government and reassessed their value against perceived threats, including from an increasingly muscular China under leader Xi Jinping. Though the unclassified version of the report didn’t include confidential assessments of specific threats, it noted that Australia’s largest defense ally, the United States, is “no longer the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific”. “China’s assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia’s national interests,” the review said. The highest level of strategic risk that Australia now faces is the prospect of a major conflict in the region, the review added, suggesting a strategy of greater self-sufficiency combined with stronger relationships with its allies and key powers in the region, including Japan and India. For decades, Australia’s remoteness fostered the assumption that any attack would come with a 10-hour warning. Now, countries are able to “project combat power” through assaults on supply routes and cyber warfare, the review said. “The rise of the ‘missile age’ in modern warfare… has radically reduced Australia’s geographic benefits (and) the comfort of distance,” the report said. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic had exposed Australia’s vulnerability to global supply chains, Albanese told reporters, meaning it was necessary for the country to become more self-sufficient. “We need to have greater control over our national sovereignty. So not only is manufacturing things in Australia, good for jobs and good for our economy, there’s also a national security issue,” he said. Defense Minister Richard Marles said the defense posture that had served Australia well for decades was “no longer fit for purpose” and the review recasts the mission of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Its new redefined purpose is to defend the nation, project power to its northern approaches, and to maintain the global rules based order with its allies, Marles said. The review recommended Australia adopt a “strategy of denial,” defined as “a defensive approach designed to stop an adversary from succeeding in its goal to coerce states through force, or the threatened use of force, to achieve dominance.” To that end, the review recommended six priorities starting with developing a nuclear powered submarine program, previously announced under the AUKUS deal with the United States and the United Kingdom. It also recommends speeding up the acquisition of long-range strike missiles and manufacturing munitions within Australia. The country also wants to improve its defense cooperation with regional neighbors, particularly in the Pacific. Technical requirements include the need to upgrade the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft to operate long-range anti-ship missile systems. An urgent recruitment campaign is also needed to boost the ADF workforce, including the numbers of workers in shipyards to expand the submarine force. The shuffling of priorities means funding for some programs will be cut. For example, plans to purchase 450 Infantry Fighting Vehicles have been slashed to just 129. The money saved will be spent on more HIMARS rocket systems, which have been used to deadly effect in Ukraine, and landing crafts, to give the army greater mobility. The Infantry Fighting Vehicles were to have been sourced from either Hanwha Defense Australia and Rheinmetall Defence Australia, the two shortlisted tenders that are Australian arms of South Korean and German companies. The government has already held talks with the governments of those countries, said Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy. “An infantry fighting vehicle capability is an important part of a modern Australian army. But we also need the capacity to deploy them and that’s why we’re investing in landing craft medium and heavy and investing in a generational change in long range strike for the Australian Army as well,” Conroy said. Previous shifts in Australia’s defense procurement plans have angered allies, particularly France, which fumed over the former government’s cancellation of a 90 billion dollar ($60 billion) submarine deal in favor of the AUKUS program. This government has vowed to be more nimble in making decisions about defence projects, streamlining those that are considered more strategically important. The review pointed to the need for the Australian government to “abandon its pursuit of the perfect solution.” “The pursuit of the perfect has often been done at the expense of time. There is an opportunity cost and a capability cost associated with that. So we need to rebalance that,” said Marles.

      Cyclone Ilsa sets a new wind record as it smashes into Australia’s western coast
    ","Cyclone Ilsa smashed into a remote stretch of coast in Western Australia around midnight Thursday local time with wind speeds that broke previous records set more than 10 years ago in the same place. After brewing off the coast for days, Cyclone Ilsa made landfall between De Grey and Pardoo Roadhouse as a category 5 storm, according to Australian Bureau of Meteorology – the equivalent of a category 4 Atlantic hurricane. The cyclone has since weakened and is moving southeast across the state, bringing heavy rain and sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour (74 miles per hour). Just before it hit the mainland, Ilsa sped over Bedout Island, a tiny uninhabited island, where its sustained wind speeds reached 218 kph (135 mph) over a 10-minute period. “Cyclone George was the previous record holder with 194 kph back in 2007 at the very same location!” the BOM tweeted. Overnight, wind gusts on the island, which is a breeding ground for seabirds, reached as high as 288 kph (179 mph). It’s not yet clear what damage the cyclone has inflicted on Western Australia, though the winds had the potential to cause significant damage to trees, buildings, power lines and other infrastructure. Officials were planning to survey the damage from the air when it was safe enough to fly helicopters over the area. On Friday, Superintendent Peter Sutton, of the Western Australia department of fire and emergency services, said the cyclone appears to have missed the main population centers, including the town of Port Hedland, home to about 16,000 people, mostly mine workers. “There will certainly will be damage up along the coastal areas where the crossing occurred, but largely the populated areas did escape the brunt of the eye as it crossed the coast,” Sutton said. Port Hedland mayor Peter Carter told the Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the wind gusts sounded like a freight train. “I think the town was very lucky … the town is still here,” he told CNN affiliate Seven News. Port Hedland is the world’s biggest bulk export port, where large volumes of iron ore are loaded and shipped to countries including China, Japan and South Korea. Pilbara Ports Authority said the port reopened Friday after safety inspections to check for any damage to infrastructure. Bidyadanga, the largest Aboriginal community in the state, home to around 850 people, was also relatively unscathed, according to early reports. Early Friday, reports emerged of “great damage” at Pardoo Roadhouse, a popular destination for travelers on the highway along the coast. One of its owners, Will Batth, told the ABC that he endured “four hours of hell” and eventually sought shelter in a shipping container while Cyclone Ilsa tore off the roof. Authorities had warned residents to tie down anything that might take flight in strong winds – caravans, trampolines, trailers and any loose objects. “Winds of this strength are extremely dangerous. Not only can they bring down trees, power lines, and damage roofs and houses, but they can also lift large loose objects from your yard – boats, trailers or caravans – and loft them into the air,” BOM’s senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury warned. As the storm approached on Thursday, coastal areas were put under a red alert, meaning people needed to stay in place and shelter within buildings, well away from windows and doors. Evacuation centers were opened for people brought in from remote communities at risk of being pummeled by the winds and cut off by debris and flooding. Cyclone Ilsa is expected to dump heavy rain on the region – as much as 200 to 300 millimeters, according to BOM – and vast areas of the state are under flood watch. “Riverine flooding may significantly impact roads and access routes, with many paths becoming muddy or even inaccessible over the coming days,” Bradbury said on Thursday. The strongest storm ever to hit any part of Australia was Cyclone Monica, which arrived in 2006 with sustained winds around 290 kph (180 mph), as it swept across the eastern and northern parts of Australia. That cyclone missed highly populated areas but brought down trees and caused severe damage to vegetation along with a storm surge up to six meters high.

      Cyclone Ilsa rapidly intensifies as it approaches landfall in Western Australia
    ","A massive cyclone swirling off Australia’s western coast will likely make landfall as a category 5 storm – the strongest on the national scale – according to the country’s official forecaster. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) expects Cyclone Ilsa to cross the Pilbara coast of Western Australia Thursday evening or Friday morning local time, between Port Hedland and Wallal Downs, lashing the region with wind gusts in excess of 285 kilometers per hour (177 miles per hour). Late Thursday, a red alert was put in place for a 450 kilometer (280 mile) stretch of coastline, meaning people still in that area need to shelter in the strongest part of the house, well away from windows and doors. “Communities in those coastal areas hopefully are already hunkered down, ready to ride this one out. And hopefully communities inland are finalizing their preparations because we’ll start to see impacts in that part of the world from tomorrow,” said Todd Smith, BOM’s hazard preparedness and response manager for the north and west. Evacuation centers have been set up across the sparsely populated area, with residents bussed in from remote communities at risk of being pummeled by the winds and cut off by debris and flooding. “Any houses that aren’t built to code are going to suffer extensive damage. Fortunately it looks like the system is going cross in a relatively unpopulated part of the coast … so hopefully, most people have cleared out of the the main impact zone,” Smith added. Strong winds were felt along the coastline hours ahead of Ilsa’s predicted landfall, as emergency services implored people to lock up anything that might take flight. “Winds of this strength are extremely dangerous. Not only can they bring down trees, power lines, and damage roofs and houses, but they can also lift large loose objects from your yard – boats, trailers or caravans – and loft them into the air,” said BOM’s senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury. Australia uses a five-tier system to categorize cyclones, a different system to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center which earlier clocked Ilsa’s winds at 215 kph (134 mph), making it the equivalent of a category 4 Atlantic hurricane. The largest town near the storm’s eye is Port Hedland, home to around 16,000 people. Aboriginal communities, cattle stations, mining sites and tourist operators are also dotted around the area. Cyclone Ilsa is also expected to dump heavy rain on the region – as much as 200 to 300 millimeters, according to BOM – and vast areas of the state are under flood watch. “Riverine flooding may significantly impact roads and access routes, with many paths becoming muddy or even inaccessible over the coming days,” Bradbury said. The last major cyclone of this strength to hit the Western Australian coast was Cyclone George in 2007 with winds that reached 275 kph (170 mph). The strongest storm ever to hit any part of Australia was Cyclone Monica, which arrived in 2006 with sustained winds around 290 kph (180 mph), as it swept across the eastern and northern parts of Australia.

      Cyclone Ilsa threatens to hit Western Australia as strongest storm in a decade
    ","A powerful cyclone is intensifying off the coast of Western Australia and is expected to make landfall later Thursday or Friday morning local time as one of the most destructive storms to hit the region in more than a decade. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said Cyclone Ilsa is expected to make landfall somewhere between Port Hedland, a major port hub for the export of iron ore, and Bidyadanga, the home of the state’s largest Aboriginal community. Early Thursday, the cyclone was moving southwest along the coast but its “very destructive core” was expected to swing southeast to make landfall bringing extreme wind gusts of up to 275 kilometers per hour (170 miles per hour), the BOM said. Australia uses a five-tier system to categorize cyclones, and on Thursday it strengthened to a Category 4 cyclone. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center is predicting Ilsa to reach 240 kph (150 mph) in sustained winds prior to landfall, but it may weaken slightly before moving onshore. According to the US scale, that would make it a Category 4 hurricane. “Winds of this strength not only have the ability to bring down trees and power lines but lift items from your yard and home – caravans, trampolines,” BOM’s senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury warned Wednesday. Local authorities warned residents to tie down anything that could become airborne. Emergency services have been checking in on remote Aboriginal communities, mines, pastoral stations and tourist sites, to warn them of potential chaos ahead. People camping at Eighty Mile Beach, a popular holiday spot, have been told to move to safer ground, while officials have evacuated sick and elderly people from local communities. Bidyadanga is home to about 850 Aboriginal people, the biggest Indigenous community in the state. Earlier warnings suggested Broome, a town of about 15,000 may be hit, but the system has moved south, putting it out of the main alert zone. Port Hedland is home to about 16,000 people, many who work in the mining industry. On Tuesday, the Pilbara Port Authority said it was clearing boats from all berths in the inner harbor of the Port Hedland port, and urged recreational boat owners to secure their vessels. Cyclones are common on the west coast of Australia, with the Bureau of Meteorology logging seven of them last year. Darren Klemm, Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner of Western Australia, said it had been 10 years since a cyclone of Ilsa’s size had hit the WA coast. “There’ll be many people up there who haven’t experienced a Cat 4 cyclone before,” he said. The northern coast of Western Australia has been hit by 13 storms equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane since 1960, but this would be the first since Tropical Cyclone Laurence in 2009, which hit in a very similar location with winds of 150 mph (240 kph) at landfall. The strongest storm ever to hit any part of Australia was Tropical Cyclone Monica, which arrived in 2006 with sustained winds around 180 mph (290 kph), as it swept across the eastern and northern part of Australia. Australia has experienced a series of natural disasters in recent years. Last year, flooding affected parts of the states of New South Wales and Queensland.

      Man charged after platypus is taken from the wild and onto a train
    ","A 26-year-old man has been charged with allegedly removing a platypus from its natural habitat in Morayfield, a town in Australia, Queensland Police said on Thursday following a hunt for the suspect and animal. Police allege that the man, accompanied by a woman, took the platypus from a local waterway on Tuesday and traveled by train to the nearby town of Caboolture where they entered a shopping mall and showed the animal to members of the public. The man, who has not been named, was charged with one count of taking a protected animal and a restriction on keeping or using a protected animal. Such charges can carry a maximum penalty of 431,250 AUD (about $289,000), police added. The platypus’ current condition is unknown. Although police were advised that the animal was released into the nearby Caboolture River, it has not yet been located by authorities. Queensland Police cautioned that a platypus can become sick or die while out of its natural habitat and warned that it should not be fed or introduced to a new environment. Male platypuses also have venomous spurs on their hind feet, making them dangerous for humans to handle. “If you are lucky enough to see a platypus in the wild, keep your distance. Never pat, hold or take an animal from the wild,” police said in a statement. The platypus’ removal from its habitat sparked a police hunt, as both the force and the Department of Environment and Science made a joint appeal for the animal’s surrender to an emergency vet or police station. Police released pictures of two people – one carrying the platypus and another carrying a bag – in their initial appeal for information, and later added that a woman had spoken with them. Investigations are ongoing and the man is due to appear in court on Saturday, police added. Native to Australia, platypuses are small amphibious mammals, known for their distinctive duck-like bill and, unlike most other mammals, for laying eggs as well as producing milk for their young.

      Chinese ambassador sparks European outrage over suggestion former Soviet states don’t exist
    ","European countries are demanding answers from Beijing after its top diplomat in Paris questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet republics, in comments that could undermine China’s efforts to be seen as a potential mediator between Russia and Ukraine. The remarks by China’s ambassador to France Lu Shaye, who said during a television interview that former Soviet countries don’t have “effective status in international law,” have caused diplomatic consternation, especially in the Baltic states. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia would be summoning Chinese representatives to ask for clarification, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis confirmed on Monday. Officials including from Ukraine, Moldova, France and the European Union also all hit back with criticisms of Lu’s comments. Lu made the remarks in response to a question on whether Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, was part of Ukraine. “Even these ex-Soviet countries don’t have an effective status in international law because there was no international agreement to materialize their status as sovereign countries,” Lu said, after first noting that the question of Crimea “depends on how the problem is perceived” as the region was “at the beginning Russian” and then “offered to Ukraine during the Soviet era.” The remarks appeared to disavow the sovereignty of countries that became independent states and United Nations members after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 – and come amid Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine under leader Vladimir Putin’s vision the country should be part of Russia. The Chinese embassy in France said later that Lu’s comments were “not a statement of policy, but an expression of personal views.” “On territorial sovereignty, the Chinese side’s position is consistent and clear. The Chinese side respects the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries and upholds the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,” the embassy said in a statement on Monday. “Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the countries concerned… The Chinese side respects the status of the republics born after the dissolution of the Soviet Union as sovereign countries,” it added. The statement followed similar comments from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a press briefing earlier Monday. Beijing has so far refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or call for a withdrawal of its troops, instead urging restraint by “all parties” and accusing NATO of fueling the conflict. It has also continued to deepen diplomatic and economic ties with Moscow. The statement from the Chinese embassy in France continued: “On the issue of Ukraine, China’s position is consistent and clear. It is ready to continue working with the international community to make its own contribution to the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.” Meanwhile, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said that China will be discussed during a foreign ministers meeting on Monday. “We have been talking a lot about China (over) the last days, but we will have to continue discussing about China because it’s one of the most important issues for our foreign policy,” Borrell said. The EU foreign ministers will also raise the situation in Moldova and Georgia, as those countries “see the war (in Ukraine) very close, they feel the threat,” he added. Moldova is a small country on Ukraine’s southwestern border that has been caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion. Georgia, which shares a frontier with Russia further east, has also come under the spotlight, after protests erupted over a controversial foreign agents bill similar to one adopted in the Kremlin to crack down on political dissent. “For us Georgia is a very important country and remember that it has specific security issues because its territory is partially occupied by Russia,” Borrell said. On Sunday, he tweeted that the remarks by the Chinese ambassador were “unacceptable” and “the EU can only suppose these declarations do not represent China’s official policy.” France also responded Sunday, with its Foreign Ministry stating its “full solidarity” with all the allied countries affected and calling on China to clarify whether these comments reflect its position, according to Reuters. Germany on Monday also called for China to clarify, especially since the statements “were not in line with the Chinese position known to us so far.” “Of course we expect China to explain its position unequivocally,” German Foreign Office spokesman Christian Wagner said. “The sovereignty and territorial integrity of these states is inviolable,” he added. Several leaders in former Soviet states, including Ukraine, were quick to hit back following the interview, which aired Friday on French station LCI. Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics called for an “explanation from the Chinese side and complete retraction of this statement” in a post on Twitter Saturday. He pledged to raise the issue during a meeting of EU foreign ministers Monday. “We are surprised about Chinese (ambassador’s) statements questioning sovereignty of countries declaring independence in ’91. Mutual respect & (territorial) integrity have been key to Moldova-China ties,” the Moldovan ministry said on its official Twitter account. “Our expectations are that these declarations do not represent China’s official policy.” “It is strange to hear an absurd version of the ‘history of Crimea’ from a representative of a country that is scrupulous about its thousand-year history,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s Presidential Administration, also wrote on Twitter. “If you want to be a major political player, do not parrot the propaganda of Russian outsiders,” he added. This is not the first time that Lu – a prominent voice among China’s so-called aggressive “wolf-warrior” diplomats – has sparked controversy for his views. “He’s been a well-known provocateur,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. “But he’s a diplomat, he represents his government, so it reflects some thinking within China about the issue,” he said. adding, however, that it’s “not the time for China to put at risk its relationship” with France. The comments place Beijing under the spotlight at a particularly sensitive moment for its European diplomacy. Ties have soured as Europe has uneasily watched China’s tightening relationship with Russia and its refusal to condemn Putin’s invasion. Beijing in recent months has sought to mend its image, highlighting its stated neutrality in the conflict and desire to play a “constructive role” in dialogue and negotiation, further fueling debate in European capitals over how to calibrate its relationship with China, a key economic partner. That debate intensified this month following a visit to Beijing from French President Emmanuel Macron, who signed a raft of cooperation agreements with China during a trip he framed as an opportunity to start work with Beijing to push for peace in Ukraine. Voices in former Soviet states, where many remember being under Communist authoritarian rule, have been among those in Europe critical of such an approach. “If anyone is still wondering why the Baltic States don’t trust China to ‘broker peace in Ukraine,’ here’s a Chinese ambassador arguing that Crimea is Russian and our countries’ borders have no legal basis,” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Landsbergis wrote on Twitter Saturday following Lu’s interview. Moritz Rudolf, a fellow and research scholar at the Paul Tsai China Center of the Yale Law School in the US, said China had been “increasingly successful in being perceived as a responsible power that might play a constructive role in a peace process in Ukraine.” Lu’s comments “directly undermined China’s latest diplomatic outreach efforts to Europe and Beijing’s ambition to be viewed” in this light, Rudolf said. They also contradicted China’s “official position and practice,” including as Beijing had not recognized Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea or any territory it annexed since 2014, he added. “Beijing is now exercising damage control underlining that the stakes are high for the (People’s Republic of China),” he said, pointing to the statements from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassy in France. Others suggested Lu’s remarks may also shed light on Beijing’s real diplomatic priorities. For Russia, giving up control of Crimea is widely seen as a non-starter in any potential peace settlement on Ukraine. This means Beijing may have a hard time giving a straight answer on this question, according to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center. “The question is impossible to answer for China. China’s relationship with Russia is where its influence comes from,” she said, adding that didn’t mean Lu could have given a “better answer.” “Between sabotaging China’s relationship with Russia and angering Europe, (Lu) chose the latter.” ",1413,china,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/china/china-ambassador-lu-shaye-baltic-soviet-states-europe-intl-hnk/index.html

      Chinese zero-Covid protesters released after four months in custody
    ","A young Chinese woman who was arrested after attending a peaceful protest against Covid-19 restrictions in Beijing last year has been released alongside several of her friends after four months in police custody, according to a source familiar with their situation. Cao Zhixin, a 26-year-old publishing house editor, recorded a video in December days before she was detained, as she learned of her friends disappearing into detention one by one after they joined a vigil together to commemorate losses they attributed to China’s now-scrapped zero-Covid policy. Cao was released Wednesday evening, according to a source with direct knowledge. Three of her friends who were detained around the same time in December were also released, according to the source, who learned of their situation through mutual friends. The circumstances of their release were not immediately clear, nor was it clear whether they still face any charges. CNN has not been able to contact the women. Police in Beijing’s Chaoyang district, believed to be handling the cases, hung up when CNN phoned for comment and a fax to the bureau did not go through. CNN’s fax to Beijing’s municipal police department also did not go through. The women were among eight people, mainly young, female professionals in the same extended social circle, that CNN in January confirmed had been quietly detained by authorities in the weeks following the peaceful protest in the Chinese capital on November 27. Their detentions garnered global attention, with supporters and rights groups calling for their release and pointing to their case as a symbol of the ever-narrowing space for public expression of dissent in China under leader Xi Jinping. As she emerged from her months-long detention, Cao remained unaware of the huge attention her case has garnered, according to the source, even as her own words, recorded in a video prior to her detention and released by friends afterward, have been widely viewed and reported. “At the scene, we followed the rules, without causing any conflict with the police … Why does this have to cost the lives of ordinary young people? … Why can we be taken away so arbitrarily?” she asked in that video. The November 27 event attended by the young women in the group was one of many sweeping through Chinese cities at that time, as young people held vigils and demonstrations, many spurred to the streets in sadness and anger over the heavy human cost of three years of the Chinese government’s draconian zero-Covid policy. Participants at the event carried flowers to remember the at least 10 people killed in a fire that consumed their locked-down building in the northwestern city Urumqi. Public anger had grown following the emergence of video footage that appeared to show lockdown measures delaying firefighters from accessing the scene and reaching victims. Some held up blank sheets of white A4-sized paper – a metaphor for the countless critical posts, news articles and outspoken social media accounts that were wiped from the internet by China’s censors, according to CNN reporting at the time. Following the protests, the Chinese government scrapped its zero-Covid policy in an abrupt about-face that also came in the face of steep economic challenges, though it did not directly acknowledge nationwide protests in public statements. But authorities also unleashed a security crackdown against what had been the largest showing of public discontent since the 1989 pro-democracy student protests in Tiananmen Square. In Beijing, authorities tracked people suspected of demonstrating, interrogating and detaining some – like Cao and her friends. The detentions and arrests among that group sparked shock and concern from those who know the women, who described them as young female professionals working in publishing, journalism and education, that were engaged and socially-minded, but not dissidents or organizers. The overall number of people detained in connection with the protests within China’s notoriously opaque security and judicial systems also remains uncertain, as does the number of people, if any, that remain in custody. Beijing authorities have made no official comment about the detentions. There has been no public confirmation from the authorities involved that these or any other detentions were made in connection with the protests. Of the eight detained by January, at least two, including Cao, were formally charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” people directly familiar with their cases told CNN at the time. The loosely defined charge, which carries a maximum sentence of up to five years, has become a catch-all used by Chinese law enforcement in their crackdown on dissent, protest and advocacy. Under Chinese law, the two others released alongside Cao would also likely have been formally charged to remain in custody until Wednesday, though CNN has not confirmed their charges. Two others in the group were released on bail in January, CNN confirmed at the time, while two more were released in February, according to the source familiar with the situation of those released this week. It was not clear whether they were also released on bail. The source familiar with Cao’s situation said that police still had her phone, and that she had been let go from her editing job. Teng Biao, a renowned human rights lawyer who took on many politically sensitive cases in China before moving to the US, said if the four protesters were released on bail, their cases would likely be dropped later. “By law, being granted bail doesn’t mean the case is over. But in practice, many human rights cases (in China) were closed like this,” Teng said. But while the release of those in the Beijing group, whose circumstances are now known globally, is “welcome news,” he said, they may only be a fraction of those arrested for participating in the protests across the country. In the case of Cao and those released in Beijing, Teng said, “All they did was attend a peaceful protest, which is not against the law.” “Nor did it have any harm to society,” he added. “Quite on the contrary, they pushed for progress in society and helped end China’s zero-Covid policy.” ",1006,china,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/china/beijing-zero-covid-vigil-protesters-released-intl-hnk/index.html

      A hospital fire killed 29 in Beijing, but residents were kept in the dark for hours
    ","The deadliest fire to hit the Chinese capital in two decades killed 29 people in a hospital Tuesday, but most people didn’t hear about it until several hours later, and even then the details were slim as authorities kept a tight lid on details. As flames tore through the Changfeng Hospital in Fengtai district from around 1 p.m. Tuesday, forcing some to desperately clamber out of windows and huddle on air conditioning units, state media kept silent and censors appeared to scrub the internet of any mentions. The extent of information control and censorship came as a shock to internet users, as well as Beijing residents, many of whom complained online that they had no idea a deadly fire had erupted in their city until late on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Beijing officials offered more details about the fire during a news conference, which was delayed for half an hour and lasted less than 20 minutes. The blaze that engulfed an inpatient building of Changfeng Hospital was caused by sparks from interior renovation work that ignited flammable paint, said Zhao Yang, an official at Beijing’s fire department, on Wednesday. Twelve people were detained on suspicion of gross negligence, including the hospital’s director and construction workers, said Sun Haitao, an official with the Beijing Public Security Bureau. In videos shared on social media Tuesday – before they were censored – smoke could be seen billowing out of several hospital windows as people desperately attempted to escape the blaze. At least one person appeared to use a rope made from bedsheets to descend from a window onto a lower level terrace. Others were seen either huddling on air conditioning units positioned on the exterior of the building, or trying to use the units to maneuver themselves from one level to the next. One person was seen jumping from one level of the building to the lower terrace. The blaze is the most deadly in Beijing in recent years, surpassing the toll from a fire in 2017 that killed 19 in a cramped two-story building in Daxing district in the capital’s southern suburb. It’s also one of the most heavily censored incidents in recent years – and a sign of the tightening controls on media in China under leader Xi Jinping, the country’s most authoritarian leader in a generation. The fire broke out in a busy neighborhood in western Beijing around noon on Tuesday, but it wasn’t reported by Chinese media until about eight hours after firefighters answered calls for help. At 8.43 p.m., a terse report on the incident was published by the Beijing Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese capital – more than 7 hours after the blaze was put out and over 5 hours after rescue efforts wrapped up. On Chinese social media, many questioned why the public had been kept in the dark for so long. “The incident happened after 12 p.m., and not a single media outlet reported on the breaking news at the time,” said a top comment on Weibo, noting that most state media outlets only carry standardized press releases after 9 p.m.. “The media has now basically become copy machines for standardized press releases,” it added. China’s social media platforms, which had been fast to spread information about similar incidents in the past, were also largely silent about the fire throughout the afternoon. The information control is extraordinary especially given the popularity of short video platforms and livestreaming sites in China. “It is often said that in the era when everyone has a microphone, it is difficult to prevent news from spreading, but now it seems that it is not that difficult after all,” a commentator said on Wechat. “Although 21 people have died, as long as (the authorities) don’t announce it, it will be as if nothing has happened in society,” the commentator said Tuesday before the death toll jumped to 29. In the short news conference Wednesday, officials revealed details of those who died. Among them were 26 inpatients with an average age of 71. The oldest victim was 88. A nurse, a care worker and a family also died in the fire, according to Li Zongrong, deputy head of the Fengtai district government. A total of 142 people were evacuated, including 71 patients. As of Wednesday, 39 injured remained in hospital, with three in critical condition, said Li Ang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Heath Commission. The family members of patients at the Changfeng Hospital said even as the tragedy was unfolding, they were oblivious. On Tuesday evening, some rushed to the hospital to search for their loved ones after learning about it on the news, according to China Youth Daily, a state-run newspaper. “Seven or eight hours have passed and I didn’t receive a single phone call,” a relative was quoted as saying. But the hospital refused to give them a list of names of the victims, and instead asked them to register their information and wait for an official notice, the report said. Following state media reports on the incident, social media discussions remained tightly controlled. Footage and photos of the fire were censored in real time, as were posts critical of the government’s handling of the fire and subsequent censorship. Many questioned why the incident did not become a trending topic on Weibo throughout Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Some compared the limited social media visibility of the fire to the overwhelming coverage of a fatal explosion at an Ohio metals plant in the US in February, which dominated Weibo trending topics for days. While some Chinese media outlets have since published in-depth reporting on the aftermath of the fire, the initial, lengthy silence has come at the dismay of some liberal Chinese journalists. On Wechat, a newspaper editor in Beijing lamented the tightening grip of censorship and control of society. “The most terrifying thing is not the death of 29 people, but eight hours of silence,” the editor wrote in a post. “The former is an accident and dereliction of duty, while the latter is a deliberate act with full effort, to unscrupulously show off its ability of social control, to treat us like deaf, blind, fools and worthless subjects. Accidents can be prevented, but the deliberate act may become the norm.” ",1045,china,2023-04-19,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/china/china-beijing-fire-censorship-intl-hnk/index.html

      Hospital fire in Beijing kills at least 21 people
    ","At least 21 people have died in a fire that tore through a hospital in China’s capital Beijing, state media CCTV reported on Tuesday. Amateur video shows people hanging from the façade of the building while attempting to escape the blaze which started around 1 p.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) in what Chinese state media described as the inpatient department of Changfeng Hospital. “As of 6pm local (6am EST), 21 people have unfortunately died,” CCTV said. Additionally, 71 patients were evacuated. The blaze is one of the most deadly in Beijing in recent years, surpassing the toll from a fire in 2017 that killed 19 in a cramped two-story building in Daxing district in the capital’s southern suburb. That tragedy prompted authorities to demolish large swathes of buildings deemed illegal or unsafe in the neighborhood and forced thousands of migrant workers out of their homes and businesses. In videos shared on social media Tuesday, smoke can be seen billowing out of several hospital windows as people attempt to escape the blaze. At least one person appears to use a rope made from bedsheets to descend from a window to a lower level terrace. Others people are seen either sitting on air conditioning units positioned on the exterior of the building, or trying to use the units to maneuver from one level to the next. One person is seen jumping from one level of the building to the lower terrace. It is unclear if all those seen outside the building escaped the fire or not. At least two ladders are seen leaning against the building amid rescue efforts. Several other clips that showed the exterior of the building and were posted on Weibo have since been removed.

      China has ramped up construction on its new Antarctic station, new report reveals
    ","China is making “significant progress” building the country’s fifth research facility in Antarctica after a several years-long lull in construction, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). New support facilities and groundwork for a larger structure have appeared at the site following several years of dormancy after construction began in 2018, the Washington-based think tank said in a report released Tuesday. The findings were based on satellite imagery taken in recent months by Maxar. The site – a research station China has hailed as a means to expand its scientific investigation in the Antarctic – could also be used to enhance the country’s intelligence collection, according to CSIS. China is far from alone in bolstering its presence and research activities in the frozen continent, where a number of countries including the United States, Britain, and South Korea all operate research stations. But attention has turned to potential dual-use of China’s facilities amid increasing power competition with the United States and Western concerns about Beijing’s assertive foreign policy and surveillance capabilities. The new station’s position, on Inexpressible Island near the Ross Sea, is triangulated with China’s other coastal stations on Antarctica to “fill in a major gap in China’s coverage” of the continent, and could support intelligence collection given its inclusion of a satellite ground station, according to the CSIS report. The station’s position may enable China to “collect signals intelligence from US-allied Australia and New Zealand” and “collect telemetry data on rockets launching from newly established space facilities in both countries,” it said. Once completed, the 5,000-square-meter (53,820-square-foot) station is expected to include a scientific research and observation area, an energy facility, a main building, a logistics facility and a wharf for China’s Xuelong icebreakers, according to CSIS. In February 2020, a team of US inspectors visited the station, where they were hosted by station leader Wang Zhechao of the Polar Research Institute of China. They found no military equipment or military support personnel at the site, according to a report of the inspection published by the United States State Department. Once completed the scientific research at the station would focus on physical and biological oceanography, glaciology, marine ecology, zoology, atmospheric and space physics and geology, the account said, citing a 2018 draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation about the project submitted by China to an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. China has established four scientific research bases in Antarctica since 1984, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A 2022 Department of Defense report on China’s military notes that “(China’s) strategy for Antarctica includes the use of dual-use technologies, facilities, and scientific research, which are likely intended, at least in part, to improve PLA (People’s Liberation Army) capabilities.” China, however has stressed the scientific nature of its ambitions in the region. In an address to researchers based in polar regions at the start of this year, then-Vice Premier Han Zheng hailed the teams’ contributions to “humanity’s scientific understanding and peaceful use of polar and ocean regions.” Han has since been appointed China’s vice president. Under the 1959 treaty Antarctic Treaty, to which China is party, activities on the continent are restricted to “peaceful purposes.” Military personnel are allowed to conduct scientific research, but may not set up bases, test weapons of carry out maneuvers.

      Russia’s deputy defense minister is under sanctions. His ex-partner is still living the high life in Europe, investigation reveals
    ","On a rainy Sunday afternoon, a handful of protesters gather outside an upscale Parisian apartment complex. “Freedom for political prisoners!” they chant. “Down with Putin! Putin is a war criminal!” Several hold signs: “He makes money off the war in Ukraine. His family lives in France,” or “Family of a war criminal lives in Paris.” What’s brought them here is the Russian socialite who reportedly rents one of the apartments inside, and her other half, Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov. Svetlana Maniovich is a woman of expensive tastes: invite-only Parisian jewelers, couture clothing and yacht vacations on the Mediterranean. The lifestyle isn’t unusual for people in her elite Russian circle, and her lavish spending has been on display on social media and in Russia’s society pages. But she’s no ordinary Moscow highflyer. Her former partner, Ivanov, is a senior architect of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – a man who, on paper, reportedly has an official income of around $175,000 per year. He’s also the subject of European Union (EU) and American sanctions over the war on Ukraine. Maniovich is the subject of an extensive investigation by the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), an investigative team founded by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The ACF, which organized the Paris protest, alleges that it is Ivanov, and ill-gotten gains brought in by his government position, that has funded Maniovich’s lifestyle. “For the uber-corrupt people, it’s almost like it was – almost like nothing changed,” said Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations for the ACF, in reference to the impact of Western sanctions. Drawing on a trove of 8,000 leaked emails, Pevchikh and her team assembled a picture of a woman who has seemingly escaped all scrutiny for Ivanov’s role in Ukraine, and the extreme profits he’s allegedly reaped. A video about Maniovich produced by the ACF has racked up over six million views on YouTube. Using invoices found in her email, the ACF investigation claims, for instance, that on March 25, 2022 – as Russian missiles were raining down on Kharkiv – Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewelry store on the famed Place Vendome. Just last month, and more than five months after the EU placed Ivanov on its sanctions list, a Ukrainian video crew caught Maniovich on camera shopping and dancing in Courchevel, the elite French ski resort. Maniovich – who also goes by Svetlana Ivanova, as well as by her maiden name, Svetlana Zakharova – did not return CNN’s request for comment. CNN has not independently verified the source of Maniovich’s apparently unexplained wealth. Her lifestyle is funded, the ACF alleges, by the graft of Ivanov, who holds “one of the most lucrative jobs that one can have in the Ministry of Defense,” according to Pevchikh. “He is responsible for construction,” Pevchikh said. “So every building site (that) there is for the Russian army, that’s his domain.” His extreme wealth – with assets including, the ACF says, a historical house in one of Moscow’s most expensive districts, and a luxurious dacha – has a simple explanation. “The answer is corruption,” Pevchikh argued. “Corruption, and specifically kickbacks. This is the system, the core concept of Russian corruption.” The Russian Ministry of Defense did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. The ACF alleges that Ivanov, already a wealthy man, is benefitting extensively from the invasion of Ukraine. The minister is frequently pictured in Russian-occupied Mariupol by state media, cutting ribbons on various construction projects. When Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Mariupol in March, he held what was billed as an impromptu middle-of-the-night encounter with residents at one of Ivanov’s new apartment blocks. “They destroyed Mariupol first, and then they designated a little plot of land where they built display houses,” Pevchikh said. “The same company that built the display houses in Mariupol is paying for Timur Ivanov’s personal bills, personal construction projects, like his house on the outskirts of Moscow and his house in the center of Moscow,” she claimed. So how is Maniovich able to get away with her luxurious, European lifestyle? “It’s a very simple trick that they’ve played,” Pevchikh said. First, she said, Maniovich has an Israeli passport, through her first husband. But more to the point, the ACF alleges, Maniovich and Ivanov have severed their ties – at least on paper. The pair finalized their divorce in August 2022,  according to court documents included by ACF in their investigation – six months after the war began and just two months before the EU placed an asset freeze and travel ban on him – but not her. Yet no public records show Maniovich and Ivanov have even begun the process to divide assets or custody (which can take years), the ACF says. “The biggest indication of a real divorce is the division of assets afterwards. We see none of that,” Pevchikh said, referring to the evidence uncovered by ACF’s investigative team. “In terms of the things that legally point to a real divorce, we don’t see any changes. It all still looks the same.” In a statement to CNN, the French Foreign Ministry said it does not comment on individual cases, but that it had targeted 1,499 Russian officials with sanctions. “We are continuing discussions with other member states in order to adopt new sanctions, to maintain pressure on Russia and to hinder its war effort,” the ministry said. Whether the protesters’ demand that Maniovich herself face a reckoning is, so far, a question without a satisfactory answer.

      Foreign powers rescue nationals while Sudanese must fend for themselves
    ","Foreign powers have rescued embassy staff, diplomats and nationals caught in Sudan’s deadly fighting, even as on the ground many Sudanese are stuck in deteriorating and deadly conditions. At least 50 people were injured and an unknown number killed in shelling that rocked the capital Khartoum on Monday, the Preliminary Committee of Sudan Doctors’ Union said in a statement. Meanwhile foreign governments led rescue efforts to evacuate civilians from the intense conflict. US special forces helped bring almost 100 people – mostly US embassy staff, as well as a small number of diplomatic professionals from other countries – to safety over the weekend, US officials said. Many other nations are scrambling to do the same, with more than 1,000 European Union nationals evacuated so far. The United Nations has temporarily relocated its Khartoum-based staff to Port of Sudan, it said in a statement. Around 700 UN, international NGO and embassy staff and their dependents traveled by road to the Red Sea city, the statement said. The evacuations have been complicated by ongoing clashes. The two sides at the center of more than a week of fighting – Sudan’s army and a paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – blamed each other after a French evacuation convoy came under fire trying to leave Sudan, with one French national injured. An Egyptian diplomat, Mohamed Al-Gharawi, was shot and killed on his way back to the Egyptian embassy in Khartoum on Monday following “evacuation procedures for Egyptian citizens in Sudan,” Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. The Sudanese Armed Forces accused RSF for the death, which CNN has been unable to independently verify. The RSF responded by offering their sincerest condolences to the Egyptian government and said that they will “spare no effort in cooperating with the brothers in the Republic of Egypt to uncover the facts about the Gharawi incident.” Meanwhile, many Sudanese civilians are either trapped in their homes with dwindling food, or desperately looking to find exit routes out of the country via its land borders, with the capital’s main international airport still shuttered. Sudan’s military leader, Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, and commander of the RSF, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, seized control of the country in a military coup in 2021 and were due to hand over power to a civilian government but turned on each other instead. More than 420 people have been killed and 3,700 injured in the fighting, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The humanitarian situation on the ground is deteriorating without access to medical services, and with many left stranded without food or water. A series of ceasefires, including the latest called for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, have been broken. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the warring factions had agreed on a new 72-hour ceasefire to begin at midnight, “following intense negotiation over the past 48 hours.” Residents in parts of Khartoum told CNN early on Sunday morning that there were no signs that the cessation of hostilities was being adhered to, as they awoke to aerial attacks, heavy artillery, explosions and gunfire. They relayed that clashes were raging around the military headquarters and presidential palace in the city center. Despite the risks, foreign governments continue to announce rescue missions for their citizens. French Foreign Minister spokesman Anne-Claire Legendre told CNN’s  Isa Soares on Monday that France evacuated approximately 500 people including almost 200 of them from 36 other countries. Legendre said, “We’ve evacuated approximately 500 people. Now they’re safe and in security in Djibouti in our air force base there,” and added “We offered support to our friendly partners and allies. And there’s more than 36 nationalities, different nationalities that have been rescued, so almost 200 people from 36 other countries that we managed to evacuate.” France evacuated “12 American citizens as well as British, Irish but also from Africa, Asia and rest of the world,” Legendre pointed out. Several other countries have successfully carried out evacuations, including Spain, Jordan, Italy, Denmark and Germany, while the United Kingdom has evacuated embassy staff. Several of those convoys also carried citizens from other countries, including Swedes, Portuguese, Mexicans, Palestinians, Iraqis and Syrians. US citizens in Sudan were advised they could join evacuation convoys organized by the UAE and Turkey on Sunday, with the US government saying it has no plans for its own citizen evacuation. There are an estimated 16,000 American citizens in Sudan – most of whom are dual nationals. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said Monday that more than 1,000 EU nationals have been evacuated so far, calling it a “successful operation.” More evacuations are still being planned or are underway for the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Egypt, Turkey, Libya, India, Russia, Australia, Japan, China and the Philippines. About 500 Indian nationals reached Port Sudan with more on the way, India’s Minister of External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar said Monday. The German Armed Forces evacuated 311 people on Monday morning, including Germans and evacuees from more than 20 other nations. A Spanish military plane with 34 Spaniards and 38 citizens from 11 other nations landed in Madrid on Monday morning, according to Spain’s foreign ministry. Uganda is evacuating 300 of its citizens via buses to the Ethiopian border, where they will fly out of Ethiopian city of Gondar, Dickson Ogwang, the head of the chancery of the Ugandan embassy in Khartoum, told CNN. Up to 50 Irish citizens have been extracted from Sudan in the last 24 hours with the assistance of France and Spain, the country’s foreign minister said Monday. In Rome, the first Italian nationals evacuated from Sudan landed in the capital on Monday evening local time. Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that some Japanese nations evacuated from Sudan had arrived in Djibouti, with the help of the French government. At the same time, Britons in Sudan said they feel “abandoned” by the UK government’s move to evacuate diplomats only. One British citizen, named Fatima, told the BBC that she feels “abandoned” by the government, calling the situation on the ground “traumatizing.” Meanwhile, the UK’s Africa Minister Andrew Mitchell has stressed that the government “will do everything” it can to get thousands of British citizens out of Sudan. But as foreign nationals rush out on evacuation planes, millions of Sudanese citizens have been left to fend for themselves – stranded for days in their homes and uncertain of how to make their way out to safety. International organizations have condemned the fighting, which has targeted hospitals. Out of 79 hospitals in the Sudanese capital, only 22 are currently operational, according to the Central Committee for Sudan Doctors. One doctor told CNN that food and medical supplies are running precariously low. Howeida Al-Hassan, who is a doctor at Khartoum’s Alban Jadid Hospital, told CNN that  most victims coming into the hospital have suffered multiple gunshot wounds. “Every injured person we get has multiple gunshot wounds – bullets in the chest, stomach, leg. Each surgery takes a long time,” Al-Hassan told CNN on Monday. She also says the medical team at the hospital have been working around the clock for the past 10 days. “It’s the same staff from the first day [of the fighting].  We went in and never left. We are very exhausted. We sleep sitting down,” Al-Hassan said. “You can’t really call it sleeping, it’s more like passing out.” As regions of Sudan are battered by the violence, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it will have to “adapt” its emergency response. “We have managed to relocate some our staff by road to Kassala and Gedaref and will try to evacuate some non-essential personnel by road to Ethiopia and Chad,” Africa’s regional spokesperson Alyona Synenko told CNN in a statement. “We are also urgently looking for ways to deploy additional personnel and deliver supplies to provide emergency response in Khartoum and other regions of Sudan affected by fighting.” Isma’il Kushkush, a Sudanese-American journalist based in Khartoum, was trapped with 29 residents, including children and foreign nationals, in a building in downtown Khartoum near the presidential palace for days. “No power or water for five days. Using little water remaining in water tank. Running out of food rations. Unable to leave the building which is located two blocks from the presidential palace. Epicenter of the fighting since the conflict began,” he said in a string of text messages to CNN. The group was later safely evacuated. In neighborhood WhatsApp group chats and on social media, others were deliberating over where to get water, to charge phones, find medics and find safe passages out of Khartoum free of fighting. Many asked for advice on routes to Egypt on public transportation. A woman in her 30s, who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CNN that she managed to flee Khartoum by bus to Egypt. She said she was driven to do so by the unpredictability of the RSF and the worsening conditions in the capital. While her family had a generator and they were able to supply water to houses in their neighborhood, it was unclear how long they would be able to carry on or when the tide of clashes might bring fighters to their doorstep. “It was a case of do we stay and risk starvation. Or be killed by a stray bullet? … We decided to take the risk,” she said, adding that she had heard of people without food and water dying in their homes. “We just figured we were sitting ducks  sheltering in our houses.” A group of her relatives, including two babies and an elderly woman with a serious medical condition, found a bus driver willing to take them to Egypt. They left Friday morning and arrived at the border on Saturday evening; the group was only stopped once by Sudan’s armed forces in Omdurman, she said. But they struggled to get men without visas into Egypt and a few people without passports – including newborn babies – were turned away. “They had to be left behind. And we’re still trying to work out how to get them paperwork to get them across the border,” she said.

      Russia’s Lavrov hosts UN meeting on ‘international peace,’ gets slammed by Western diplomats
    ","Western diplomats slammed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for his country’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine during a face-to-face session hosted by Moscow’s top diplomat at the United Nations Security Council on Monday. Lavrov was in charge of the meeting, titled “Maintenance of international peace and security,” because Russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council. The last time Russia presided over the Security Council was February 2022, when it launched its invasion of Ukraine. UN ambassadors for the United States, United Kingdom and Switzerland all used their speeches at the meeting to condemn Russia’s invasion. The three women – the US’s Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Britain’s Barbara Woodward and Switzerland’s Pascale Baeriswyl – all voiced strong, direct criticism of Russia and Lavrov, at times looking directly at the top Russian diplomat. “Our hypocritical convener today, Russia, invaded its neighbor, Ukraine, and struck at the heart of the UN Charter. This illegal, unprovoked and unnecessary war runs directly counter to our most shared principles – that a war of aggression and territorial conquest is never, ever acceptable,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “As we sit here, that aggression continues. As we sit here, Russian forces continue to kill and injure civilians. As we sit here, Russian forces are destroying Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. As we sit here we brace ourselves for the next Bucha, the next Mariupol, the next Kherson, the next war crime, the next atrocity,” she added. Opening the session, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned Russia’s actions. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, is causing massive suffering and devastation to the country and its people and adding to the global economic dislocation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said, sitting right next to Lavrov. Russian diplomats have been largely cut off from various international conferences since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. However, the leadership of the Security Council, UN’s most powerful body, rotates alphabetically among its 15 member nations. Five countries – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – have permanent seats on the council. The remaining 10 members are elected for two-year terms by the UN General Assembly. Russia assumed the presidency on April 1, an event that multiple diplomats described as an “April Fool’s joke.” The meeting on Monday was attended by Elizabeth Whelan, whose brother Paul Whelan has been detained in Russia for more than four years. The US considers Whelan to be wrongfully detained. The US government was unable to secure Whelan’s release last year when it brought home two other Americans who the US said had been wrongfully detained in Russia – Trevor Reed in April and Brittney Griner in December. European Union countries issued a joint statement before the meeting, condemning Russia’s actions in Ukraine and criticizing Lavrov’s appearance at the meeting. “Russia is trying to portray itself as a defender of the UN charter and multilateralism. Nothing can be further from the truth. It’s cynical,” said Olaf Skoog, European Union representative to the UN. “We all know that while Russia is destroying, we are building. While they violate, we protect.” In his opening remarks, Lavrov launched into a tirade of unsubstantiated accusations against Ukraine and its western allies, blaming the conflict on them. “As was the case during the Cold War, we have reached the dangerous, possibly even more dangerous threshold,” Lavrov said, accusing the “United States and its allies” of “abandoning diplomacy and demanding clarification of relations on the battlefield.” Lavrov repeatedly described the Ukrainian government as “the putchists” and “the Nazi Kyiv regime,” a baseless claim that Russia has repeatedly made to justify its illegal invasion of the country. Lavrov also criticized Western countries for not recognizing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea as Russian territory, despite “a referendum being held there.” Russia forcefully annexed Crimea in 2014 after holding a sham referendum there. Ukraine and its Western allies consider the area occupied Ukrainian territory. The UN overwhelmingly rejected the referendum as illegitimate and the annexation as illegal.

      Silence along Ukraine’s southern front fuels speculation over counteroffensive
    ","Miles of empty fields where you might expect a build-up of armor. Tank tracks that emerge in the mud from nowhere, and lead there too. Distant artillery duels that locals say peak and ebb. The silence is beginning to be telling. Ukraine has made extraordinary efforts to conceal the start of its strategically vital counteroffensive. Like with its fast and smart push around Izyum and Kharkiv in the late summer last year, we may only learn of success once it has been conclusively achieved. Ukraine’s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar stated last week that the counteroffensive would not be announced. Russia, for its part, is also reluctant to speak of Ukrainian momentum, perhaps in case that shatters flaky morale among its own troops; little, too, has emerged from its side. Just Sunday, the US-based Institute for the Study of War reported comments by Russian military bloggers suggesting that Ukrainian forces had crossed the Dnipro River near Kherson – in small numbers, but in places where Moscow would prefer to think they were not. It was unclear how sustained or unprecedented the apparent small Ukrainian landings were, or how they fitted in to Ukraine’s wider plan. Ukraine’s Southern Command said little but opaquely called for “patience.” Its spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said: “The conditions of the military operation require information silence until it is safe enough for our military.” Over the past 10 days, Ukraine has been noticeably silent about the whole Zaporizhzhia area where its counteroffensive is largely expected. Only there can its military separate the occupied peninsula of Crimea from occupied territory in eastern Ukraine and the Russian mainland. There have been tiny comments from Russia’s legion of military bloggers who have been, given the tight operational security deployed by Kyiv, often the first source of information about Ukrainian maneuvers in the past offensives. Kopani, Marfopil, Kamianske, Polohy – these are all places where pro-Russian bloggers have suggested Ukrainian attempts to move forward. The evidence for these claims is frustratingly unclear, and bloggers have a poor track record. Russian aviation is also trying to hit what it thinks are Ukrainian targets. The town of Orikhiv, about 40 miles southeast of Zaporizhzhia, has seen the repeated bombardment of anything that might resemble a military hub: a sports school, a farming warehouse - empty buildings now featuring a vast crater. The tiny settlement of Vuhledar, on the further eastern end of where Ukraine might launch a counteroffensive in the south, has been hit by several heavy airstrikes in the past 48 hours. The intense and indiscriminate Russian firepower suggests the high stakes of the weeks ahead. This is a fight that Moscow has known is coming for six months. The Russians have had ample time to prepare. Russian President Vladimir Putin himself even visited the theater of war last week and met with the head of the airborne forces, Mikhail Teplinsky, whose paratroopers will be at the forefront of any defense. They have dug networks of winding trenches and defenses, which Ukrainian troops will likely either stumble on, or just go around. It is a decisive moment in the war for the Kremlin. Russia’s leaders have publicly invested what little resources they have left in a so-far unsuccessful push for the strategically unimportant city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The enormous losses on both sides, over a savage winter in which the city has been mauled beyond recognition, have not reflected the small advantage Russia would have if it eventually gained control of the entire city. It has yet to do so, and – as now is often the case – would be the victors over uninhabitable rubble. Gains for Ukrainian forces in Zaporizhzhia, however, could strike a more potent blow to Russia’s wider campaign. It is the land corridor from occupied Donbas to occupied Crimea – the piece of territory seized by Russia last year that is in the long term the most useful, linking by land a peninsula annexed in 2014 with the Russian mainland. Losing this would greatly imperil Russia’s military in Crimea and split its occupation in two. It would also betray the strategic incompetence of its military, if they were unable to prevent this most glaringly obvious of Ukrainian ambitions. This is also as decisive a moment for Kyiv. NATO has been uncharacteristically united and bold in its support and arming of Ukraine. This sort of clarity of purpose is an outlier in Western democracies, and one that elections, economic variables, and other distractions may dilute in the year ahead. Ukraine cannot count on this level of support this time next year, whatever the press releases today say. The Ukrainians face an enemy weaker than it has been for months, with the Russians even sending wounded convicts back to fight on the frontline, according to accounts from convict recruits. Kyiv’s forces have better weaponry and training from NATO than ever before. And they surely have good, real-time information from their Western allies to pry open any advantage. And the silence that we see now – the near total absence of TikToks or commentary from the Zaporizhzhia front line – may be the clearest indicator yet that this vital step is afoot.

      Former Indian lawmaker killed live on TV while in police custody
    ","A former lawmaker in India’s parliament, convicted of kidnapping, was shot dead along with his brother while police were escorting them for a medical check-up in a slaying caught on live television on Saturday. The dramatic footage of the men being killed was shared across broadcast channels and social media. A gunman is seen reaching over the shoulders of police to point a pistol at the temple of the former lawmaker, Atiq Ahmed, whose turban is blown off as the gun discharges. His brother, Ashraf Ahmed, was shot and the two victims died within minutes, while police quickly detained three men suspected of carrying out the slaying. Media reports say the assailants had been posing as journalists. One surrendered immediately after the shooting, while officers subdued the other two suspects. They had been among a crowd that had gathered as the two brothers, allegedly kingpins in a local criminal organization, were being brought, handcuffed from a hospital Prayagraj city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday evening. After carrying out the slaying, the suspected gunmen shouted Hindu religious chants. One policeman was wounded during the attack. Fearing the possibility of violent unrest in the wake of the killings, the Uttar Pradesh government barred gatherings of more than four people across the entire state. “The state government imposed restrictive orders after the killings of Atiq Ahmed and Ashraf Ahmed who were members of a large mafia involved in land grabbing and in murder cases,” said a senior police official. “We don’t want any form of protest to gain momentum,” the official said on conditions of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak with the press. The state government, controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party, has ordered a judicial probe into the killings. Last week police shot dead Atiq Ahmed’s son in Jhansi city. He had been wanted in connection to a murder case that was being investigated as part of a wider crackdown into a land mafia operating in Uttar Pradesh. Police in Uttar Pradesh have killed more than 180 suspected criminals during encounters over past six years. The head of the opposition Samajwadi Party, said the slaying of his ex-party member while in police custody demonstrated the failure of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to bring law and order to Uttar Pradesh. “When someone can be killed in firing openly amidst the security cordon of the police, then what about the safety of the general public,” said Akhilesh Yadav, chief the opposition Samajwadi Party, in a tweet.

      Tibetan leader defends Dalai Lama after ‘suck my tongue’ request to boy
    ","The head of the Tibetan government-in-exile has defended the Dalai Lama over a video in which the spiritual leader kisses a child on the lips and then asks him to “suck my tongue.” The Dalai Lama’s actions were “innocent” and had been misinterpreted, Penpa Tsering told reporters at an event in the Indian capital New Delhi on Thursday, adding that the controversy over the video had “hurt” the leader’s followers. “His holiness has always lived in sanctity, (following the life of) a Buddhist monk, including celibacy. His years of spiritual practice have gone beyond sensorial pleasures,” Tsering said. “His holiness is now being labeled all kinds of names.” In a statement Monday, the Dalai Lama – a Nobel peace laureate – apologized after a video of his exchange with the boy went viral on social media and prompted a wave of international criticism, including accusations of child abuse. Tsering claimed that internal investigations suggested “pro-Chinese sources” were behind the spread of the video on social media, but gave no evidence for the claim. “The political angle of this incident cannot be ignored,” he said. The current Dalai Lama, 87-year-old Tenzin Gyatso, is the world’s best-known living Buddhist figure. The principal spiritual leader of the “Yellow Hat” school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama is revered by millions as the reincarnation of his 13 predecessors. He has been based in India since 1959, following an unsuccessful Tibetan uprising against Chinese occupation. He later established a government-in-exile in Dharamshala, leading thousands of Tibetans who followed him there. Some of the Dalai Lama’s supporters claim his actions in the video, which was filmed in the northern Indian hillside city of Dharamshala in February, have been misinterpreted under a Western lens. “Expression of emotions and manners today has been melted together and become vividly westernized,” Namdol Lhagyari, a Tibetan activist in exile, wrote on Twitter Monday. “Bringing in narrative of other cultures, customs and social influence on gender and sexuality to interpret Tibetan way of expression is heinous.” February’s incident isn’t the first time the octogenarian has sparked controversy in recent years. He apologized after a 2019 interview with the BBC, during which he said if a female Dalai Lama should succeed him, she “should be more attractive.” The previous year, he suggested Europe should be kept for Europeans, when speaking about the rising level of African refugees entering the continent.

      Dalai Lama apologizes after video asking child to ‘suck’ his tongue sparks outcry
    ","The Dalai Lama has apologized after a video emerged showing the spiritual leader kissing a child on the lips and then asking him to “suck my tongue” at an event in northern India. In a statement Monday, the office for the Dalai Lama said he “wishes to apologize to the boy and his family, as well as his many friends across the world, for the hurt his words may have caused,” adding he “regrets” the incident. “His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras,” the statement said. His apology comes after a video of the exchange, which took place during an event in the hillside city of Dharamshala in February, went viral on social media with many users criticizing the Dalai Lama’s actions. In the video, the young boy can be seen approaching the Nobel Peace Prize winner before asking, “Can I hug you?” The 87-year-old spiritual leader then invites the boy on stage and points to his cheek and says, “first here,” prompting the boy to give him a hug and a kiss. The Dalai Lama then points to his lips, and says: “then I think finally here also.” He then pulls the boy’s chin and kisses him on the mouth. “And suck my tongue,” he says after a few seconds, poking his tongue out. The identity of the boy is not known. He was at an event with the M3M Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Indian real estate company M3M Group, based in Dharamshala, where the Dalai Lama lives in permanent exile. CNN has reached out to the M3M Foundation for comment. In response to the incident, prominent Delhi-based child rights group, Haq: Center for Child Rights, told CNN in a statement it condemns “all form of child abuse.” It added: “Some news refers to Tibetan culture about showing tongue, but this video is certainly not about any cultural expression and even if it is, such cultural expressions are not acceptable.” Some of the Dalai Lama’s supporters have decried the criticism, however, arguing the leader’s actions have been misinterpreted under a Western lens. “Expression of emotions and manners today has been melted together and become vividly westernized,” Namdol Lhagyari, a Tibetan activist in exile, wrote on Twitter. “Bringing in narrative of other cultures, customs and social influence on gender and sexuality to interpret Tibetan way of expression is heinous.” Sticking out one’s tongue is a sign of respect or agreement and was often used as a greeting in traditional Tibetan culture, according to the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

      Palestinian reporter breaks barriers by reporting in Hebrew on Israeli TV
    ","Sitting at the oversized crescent desk on a set lit up by massive screens, smartly-suited Suleiman Maswadeh fits right in with his colleagues at Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11. But between his name and very slight accent in Hebrew, it’s clear Maswadeh is something not often seen on Israeli television. He is one of the few Palestinian reporters who report in Hebrew, on Israeli TV. Maswadeh is not the first or the only Palestinian reporter on Israeli TV – there are several on the Arab affairs beat. But Maswadeh doesn’t cover only “Palestinian” stories. Recently promoted to political correspondent and anchor, he’s leaving his hometown of Jerusalem for the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv. All this by the age of 27, when only seven years ago, he did not even speak Hebrew. Speaking to CNN from Kan’s Jerusalem studios, Maswadeh said he lives his life now between worlds, feeling a constant internal debate and sometimes struggle, not only from being a reporter, but from the pressures of a community that doesn’t always approve of what he does. “I was born in East Jerusalem to a Palestinian family, to a Palestinian culture. I’m not ashamed to say that I’m Palestinian. But I also live in Israel and also feel Israeli in some ways,” Maswadeh said. “When people ask me, ‘who are you?’ I don’t know. I just say I come from Jerusalem and I’m a journalist. And that’s the two most important things of my identity.” From the Old City of Jerusalem, Maswadeh does not hold Israeli citizenship. He is one of the many Palestinians, mostly from East Jerusalem, who hold Israeli identity cards and residency, but a Jordanian passport. That passport, Maswadeh explained, is only a travel document that many Palestinians hold, and does not bestow Jordanian citizenship. He grew up in and around some of the most prominent and newsworthy places in the world. He attended a strict, all-boys Islamic school in the Old City, and played as a child in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound – known to Jews as the Temple Mount – the site of regular clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian Muslims that often trigger broader conflict. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in a 1967 war and now considers it, with West Jerusalem, as part of its “undivided capital.” Most of the international community however considers it to be occupied territory and the Palestinians want it as the capital of their future state. Maswadeh says his first interest in journalism came during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s, when there were frequent suicide bombings and other attacks in Jerusalem. “We were there looking at the TV – Israeli TV – and saw, you know, the smokes and people screaming and I didn’t know what’s happening, I didn’t speak Hebrew. I just looked at TV and I felt that I want to be there, like I want to report, I want to do something,” Maswadeh said. But his path to journalism was far from straightforward. While studying accounting at the Palestinian Birzeit University, Maswadeh worked at a high-end hotel in Jerusalem, where he said he quickly realized the mostly-Jewish waiters who spoke Hebrew made better money, because they would earn tips in the lobby where they could converse with the customers. “I decided to drop out of university and go find work because I told myself it’s better not to, you know, spend my years just working for nothing,” Maswadeh said. A friend tipped him off about a scholarship that would help him learn Hebrew in under a year. He then transferred to an Israeli college, where he studied journalism – and landed an internship at Kan’s Arabic channel. After a few months, he moved to the main Hebrew channel and worked as a field producer. His first on-air role was as Arab affairs reporter. “I really hated that. I don’t know why, it’s just I saw that all the Arab reporters, or most of the Arab reporters in Israel, report about the Arab society or something and I didn’t like that,” Maswadeh said. “I said that I can be a reporter that covers Arabs and Jews, I can cover the police and we can cover Knesset [the Israeli Parliament] or cover the prime minister’s office as any other Jewish journalist.” It was as Jerusalem correspondent that Maswadeh really made his mark, reporting from Palestinian refugee camps during police raids, on protests in East Jerusalem between Israelis and Palestinians, and on Israeli politics. He’s been a mainstay of recent coverage of the massive protests against the Israeli government’s planned judicial overhaul, and has even sat down with the extreme right-wing figures of Israel’s new government, like National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who was once convicted of racist incitement against Arabs and supporting terrorism. If at first he thought his background would hinder his ability to report on all the complex, intertwined and tense sectors of Jerusalem, Maswadeh said, instead he feels it has opened the city up for him. “When we have stories in East Jerusalem, actually the fact that I’ve come from there and people know me and people hear me, speak their language … it makes them feel comfortable talking to me and has given me access as well,” Maswadeh said. “I come to the [Israeli] police officers, I tell them my story and they see that I can understand both the Arab society and also the Jewish society, which gives me access to police officers as well. So if at the beginning I thought that it’s going to restrict me – being an Arab, or you know, covering Jerusalem as an Arab – it actually was the other way.” But one of his first major scoops as Jerusalem correspondent laid bare what he says is a “constant dilemma” – reporting on when “something bad happened in my society.” In 2020, Maswadeh revealed how Covid-19 restrictions were being violated at the Al-Aqsa mosque. Worshippers were crowding inside the mosque, many, if not most, without masks, according to his report. “I remember my grandfather calling me and telling me that everyone there is talking to him and telling him that what his grandson did was a shame to the community. And I should, you know, just leave my job right now,” Maswadeh said. “I told him, ‘it might be bad what I did, but I wouldn’t forgive myself if you died because your son prayed there and he came back and sat with you (at) dinner and infected you’.” The pressure from his family hasn’t let up, he says. “Every day that I go to a Friday dinner with my family they told me ‘Please just leave the job. Just leave it. We love seeing you on TV, it gives us a lot of pride, but you can’t do this anymore,’” Maswadeh said. Maswadeh said he gets death threats for his work, and sometimes goes into the field with security. He now only visits his parents at night. “I get threats from both sides [Palestinian and Israeli], but it was mainly from Palestinians who don’t like the fact that I work for Israeli TV,” he added. He says he tells his detractors that his presence in the newsroom and on Israeli TV helps bring the Palestinian voice to a place where it’s missing. “Sometimes when I go to the field I get people threatening me that I have to leave because I work for an occupying system. My answer to that is, this is where you make things different. I can make an effect on people’s life,” Maswadeh said, citing at least one police investigation and ultimate suspension of several officers after he reported on Israeli police injuring a Palestinian girl. And, he says, his presence is also a way to show Israelis that if young Palestinians are given the resources, and the opportunity, they can succeed. “As someone who’s from East Jerusalem, most of the chances [are] that at 25 years old he won’t be a reporter, but a terrorist who carries a knife, or you know, someone [who] was cleaning this building. For me to actually be a journalist, I feel that I am giving a message for Jewish people that if you gave all the people, citizens of East Jerusalem a chance like I got, everyone can be like me.” ",1392,middleeast,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/middleeast/palestinian-reporter-israeli-tv-mime-intl/index.html

      One-fifth of water pollution comes from textile dyes. But a shellfish-inspired solution could clean it up
    ","Every year, the textile industry uses 1.3 trillion gallons of water to dye garments – enough to fill 2 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Most of this water, loaded with harmful chemicals and dyes, flows untreated into rivers and streams. That’s why researchers at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), have created a new nanomaterial that they say can clean up these dyes and other pollutants from industrial wastewater. The material consists of tiny sand-like grains, only visible to the naked-eye in clusters, which collect pollutants on their surfaces and in their pores, says Enas Nashef, project lead and a professor of chemical engineering at Khalifa University. The nanomaterial consists of a substance called a polymer that mimics the “glue” that mussels use to stick themselves to rocks, combined with a solvent. Finding the right solvent was a challenge, says Nashef, because most solvents are toxic, but the team identified one which is both effective and, crucially, eco-friendly. “If the thing you use will pollute the water, then what is the benefit?” he says. The team tested their nanomaterial on a red-orange dye called Alizarin Red S, and published their findings earlier this year. “So far, there are no toxic effects,” says Nashef, adding that the polymer can be cleaned of the pollutants and then reused. “We’re looking at the efficiency and also the environment at the same time,” he says. While the textile industry is one of the biggest contributors to industrial wastewater, it’s not alone: manufacturing, mining, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and agriculture all add to the problem. The United Nations estimates that globally, nearly 95 trillion gallons of wastewater are produced every year – roughly equivalent to 41 years of drinking water for the entire human population. A landmark report, published last month by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), found that just 20% of wastewater is currently treated, with far less being recycled, contributing to a global shortage of clean water. The report anticipates that demand for freshwater will outstrip supply by 40% by 2030. The textiles industry accounts for up to 20% of industrial wastewater globally – one of the reasons that Nashef and his team decided to focus their efforts on dyes. They targeted “anionic dyes,” because there are not many effective methods to remove these types of dye from water. Nashef’s hopes his high-efficiency material can make a dent in the sector’s dirty wastewater problem. “Right now, they can treat the (other) dyes, but with the anionic dye, they are facing problems,” says Nashef. “So they will need (this nanomaterial) to treat it.” Now that the mussel-inspired nanomaterial has shown promising results in the lab, Nashef is looking for industrial partners, to test it in the field. He also hopes to devise solutions for cleaning more than just textile dyes from water. Nashef is developing another nanomaterial that he says could remove viruses from hospital wastewater – an innovation that could help manage the spread of future pandemics. These water-cleaning polymers could also help to make desalination processes more sustainable – an important factor in the Middle East, where freshwater sources are scarce. Desalination plants consume a lot of energy to remove salt from water. Nashef says that using membrane-based nanomaterials in pre-treatment could cut the energy needed to clean the water. “If we can target that, it will reduce the load on the desalination plants,” Nashef adds. Ultimately Nashef hopes his work in his lab will have a real-world positive impact on water supplies – and “do something for the next generation.” ",593,middleeast,2023-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/middleeast/textile-wastewater-pollutant-cleaner-hnk-scn-spc-intl/index.html

      ‘People sacrificed their lives for just 10 dollars’: At least 78 killed in Yemen crowd surge
    ","Dozens of people were killed in a crowd surge in Yemen’s capital on Wednesday as needy residents in the war-torn nation flocked to receive charity handouts from local merchants during the holy month of Ramadan, officials have confirmed. Video of the tragedy in Sanaa showed a chaotic scene with dozens of people packed tightly together, unable to move and shouting for help. Those trapped formed a tangled wall of bodies with some desperately stretching out their arms for help. A couple of men who were freed could then be seen attempting to pull others out of the deadly crush. Images from the aftermath showed shoes and slippers heaped into piles as well as scarfs strewn on the floor. “What happened tonight is a tragic and painful accident, as dozens of people were killed due to a large stampede of a number of citizens caused by a random distribution of sums of money by some merchants and without coordination with the Ministry of Interior,” the spokesman of the Houthi-run Ministry of Interior, Abdul-Khaleq al-Ajri, said in the statement. At least 78 people were killed in the crush and dozens injured, Mutahar al-Marouni, the director of the Houthi-run Health office in Sanaa, told the Houthi-run Al-Masirah news agency. According to Reuters, hundreds of people had crowded into a school to receive donations of about $9. The incident came just a few days ahead of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. During this time of the month, people start giving away Zakat al-Fitr, or the Zakat of Breaking the Fast of Ramadan, to people who are in need. Naseh Shaker, a journalist who was at the scene, told CNN there was a “very long line of people” gathered at the entrance to the school, which was being used for distributing food and financial aid. They had begun queuing after sunset with the hopes of receiving the donation, he said. When officials in charge of the distribution arrived and opened the door, “a lot of people rushed into the school.” “This is a disaster to find people sacrificed their lives for just 10 dollars,” Shaker said. “People are very hungry people are very poor.” Another eyewitness who was inside the school when the crush happened told Houthi media that more than 3,000 people had gathered to collect donations, and that they were all “standing, pushing and climbing on top of each other.” “We tried reasoning with them, told them to go back. But there were too many people,” he said. Police and rescue teams rushed to the scene, according to the Interior Ministry statement. “The dead and injured people were transferred to hospitals, and two merchants in charge of the matter were arrested,” the statement added. The head of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, Mahdi Al-Mashat, ordered an investigation into the incident on Thursday. The Houthi-run General Authority for Zakat announced in a statement it would give one million Yemeni Riyal (about $4,000) to each family of the crowd surge victims. It also said it would take care of the treatment of those injured and pay 200,000 Yemeni Riyal (about $800) to each injured person. The stampede and its overwhelming death toll reflect the current poverty rate in Yemen, said Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. “Poverty rates have greatly increased and there are more people in need,” Nagi told CNN. “The merchant who used to help 1,000 or 2,000 people now has to help 5,000 or 10,000 people.” And while the humanitarian situation is dire all over Yemen, it is particularly bad in Houthi-held areas, he said, noting that nearly 65% of Yemen’s population is under Houthi control. Houthis deal with the economic problems in areas under their control “as if they are not responsible,” attributing the different crises plaguing their cities to the war, the blockade, or other foreign actors in Yemen, Nagi said. “Assistance is not enough,” he said, “And the authorities are not concerned with society’s conditions … that is the root cause of the problem.” A top Houthi official last week told CNN that talks with the Saudis were focused on meeting the Houthis’ humanitarian demands, such as removing the blockade on ports, opening Yemen’s airspace and paying the salaries of public sector employees. Yemeni journalist Shaker said Wednesday’s tragedy was the result of years of economic desperation and the international community should “act now” to stop the war. “People are no longer killed by air strikes or by shelling of warring parties. Now they are dying because they are rushing to get food,” he said. Yemen has been described by the UN as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nine years of war have killed thousands, destroyed the economy and left 21.6 million people – two-thirds of the country’s population – in dire need of humanitarian assistance. Tens of thousands of Yemenis are living in famine, according to the UN. The country’s conflict began as a civil war in 2014, when Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government. It spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis. But it eventually became a proxy war between Iran – which has been accused of arming the Houthis – and Saudi Arabia, and the main arena for their competition for regional influence. On Sunday, a Saudi delegation arrived in Sanaa for talks with the Houthis aimed at securing a permanent ceasefire. Last Friday, negotiations bore their biggest fruits yet with a three-day prisoner swap of nearly 900 detainees from both sides. Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam tweeted on Friday that talks had been “serious and positive.” ",963,middleeast,2023-04-19,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/middleeast/yemen-sanaa-crowd-surge-intl/index.html

      Israeli police say two men shot near Jewish tomb in Jerusalem in suspected ‘terror attack’
    ","Two men have been wounded in what Israeli police say was a suspected “terror attack” that took place near the Shimon Hatzadik tomb in East Jerusalem early Tuesday local time. A police statement said the force received a report of a shooting at a vehicle in the area of Shimon Hatzadik, which is located in East Jerusalem where tensions between Palestinians and Jewish settlers have been simmering in recent years. The Shimon Hatzadik tomb is a revered holy site in Judaism located in the largely Palestinian neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem. Two people were “moderately injured,” according to medical officials and were transferred for further medical treatment, the police statement added. “Police and Border Police officers are at the scene conducting searches for the suspect who fled the scene,” it continued. In a follow-up statement, police said forces located a “Carlo” style submachine gun near the site of the shooting. A spokesperson for the Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service the two injured men involved a 50-year-old male who was sent to be treated in Shaare Tzedek Hospital and a 48-year-old to Hadassah Mt. Scopus Hospital. The attack comes amid escalating Israeli-Palestinian violence. Last year was the deadliest for both Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and for Israelis in nearly two decades, and this year is on pace to be worse. Tensions have boiled over during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which coincided this year with the Jewish Passover holiday, after Israeli police twice raided the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, whose compound is also known as the Temple Mount – one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism. Israeli police arrested hundreds whom they accused of barricading themselves inside the mosque and throwing fireworks and stones, leading to wide condemnations from the Arab and Muslim world. The complex and the neighborhood where Tuesday’s shooting took place lies in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state and which most of the international community considers to be Israeli-occupied territory. Israel captured it from Jordan in a 1967 war and considers both East and West Jerusalem as its united, “eternal capital.” ",360,middleeast,2023-04-18,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/middleeast/jerusalem-shimon-hatzadik-tomb-attack-intl-hnk/index.html

      Houthis try to reassure skeptics they won’t seek full control of Yemen, as Saudis eye exit
    ","Yemen’s Houthi rebels are not interested in spreading tyranny in the country and are willing to share power with other political factions if a permanent ceasefire with Saudi Arabia is reached, a top Houthi official has said. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, member of the Supreme Political Council and former head of Yemen’s Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said that other Yemeni factions have nothing to fear in case of a withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, promising an inclusive form of governance. “If we were not looking for full control during the war, then we will not look for full control at any other time,” al-Houthi told CNN. His attempts at reassurance will likely be viewed skeptically by the Houthis’ rivals, and come amid concerns from other stakeholders that a truce with Saudi Arabia will give the heavily-armed Iran-backed rebels free rein to take over the entire country. Yemen’s conflict began as a civil war in 2014, when Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government. It spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis. Eight years later, the coalition has been unable to dislodge the rebels, who have fired hundreds of rockets toward Saudi cities in retaliation. The war has sparked one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, leaving thousands dead and pushing parts of the country into famine. A Saudi delegation arrived in Sanaa on Sunday for talks with the Houthis aimed at securing a permanent ceasefire. And on Friday, negotiations bore their biggest fruits yet with the beginning of a three-day prisoner swap of nearly 900 detainees from both sides. Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam tweeted on Friday that talks had been “serious and positive.” Saudi Arabia has begun mending ties with old foes of late, namely Iran, Syria and now Yemen’s Houthis as it redirects its focus on economic growth at home, which requires regional stability. “Saudi Arabia currently needs stability on its southern border and to (eliminate) threats to it from Houthis and others,” said Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, adding that it will transform its role in Yemen from a military one to one of soft power. Al-Houthi told CNN the group is willing to share power and resources with the Yemeni people. “We do not want to tyrannize anything,” he said, adding that it is keen to speak to other Yemeni factions and work with them to achieve what is in their interests and “in the interest of the public.” Experts have argued that a Saudi deal with the Houthis that does not address the pre-existing political problems among Yemen’s disparate groups will only end the international dimension of the war and could escalate the civil conflict. Other factions, especially the internationally recognized government and the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) that controls parts of the south, may find al-Houthi’s promises difficult to believe, experts say, as all other stakeholders in the conflict – including the United Nations – have been excluded from the current Houthi-Saudi talks. CNN has reached out to the Saudi government for comment. “What (al-Houthi) means by Yemen’s interests is recognizing the Houthis as the only legitimate authority to rule the country,” Nadwa Al-Dawsari, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN. “What he means is that the Houthis have no intention of forcefully taking over Yemen if all other parties accept to be subordinates to the Houthis in any future arrangements.” The STC, she said, is heavily dependent on the UAE’s support and if that ends with the withdrawal of foreign forces, they don’t have a great chance to stand up to the Houthis, “who have much more sophisticated weapons, fighting experience, training, and (Iranian) commanders helping them.” The STC didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment but has said previously that it stands by its rejection of a Houthi-controlled Yemen. The group has demanded a split of the country into north and south. The Houthi leader told CNN he expected Saudi Arabia to ensure the departure of all foreign forces, including the UAE, from the country.”Our real demand is the exit of all foreign forces from the Republic of Yemen,” he said. “There is no complete resolution that can be reached unless all occupying forces leave the Yemeni republic, and this includes all islands and other areas.” The UAE is a member of the Saudi-led coalition but partially withdrew its troops from Yemen in 2019. Abu Dhabi nonetheless retains strong influence over Yemen’s south. Al-Dawsari said Abu Dhabi and Riyadh may not see eye to eye on the future of Yemen, but the UAE has repeatedly said that it supports Saudi Arabia’s efforts in the country. On Monday, a senior UAE official told CNN that the UAE “supports current efforts by Saudi Arabia to bring a political solution to the crisis, to bring peace and a permanent end to hostilities between all the various Yemen parties.” Mohamed Ali al-Houthi told CNN that talks with the Saudis haven’t included “political things,” insisting that Riyadh instead focus on meeting the group’s demands such as removing the blockade on ports, opening Yemen’s airspace and paying the salaries of public sector employees. Internal matters, including demands by the STC for the south of the country to secede, will be dealt with “in the future,” he said. The STC will be given “what is rightful (to them),” he said, but not more. He did not rule out a separation of the south but stressed that any solutions to the “southern issue” must be taken without foreign influence. Al-Houthi repeatedly stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia meeting the group’s “humanitarian demands,” referring to a compensation package that would have Riyadh pay for the rebuilding of the country and the salaries of public sector workers. The discussions remain secretive, and it is unclear how much compensation the Houthis have demanded, but experts expect it to be substantial. The Houthis have said in the past that it is seeking compensation for 1.3 million public employees and that the war has led to a cut in salaries and other expenses of nearly 95%, according to Houthi media. But some experts are concerned that the Houthis would use the money to pay its militia members. “Even if the Saudis agree to pay the salaries, we have no clear image of what that might look like,” Nagi said, adding that the internationally recognized government may also require payments. Even if a Saudi-Houthi deal is reached, there’s no guarantee that other Yemeni factions will accept it, experts say. “Based on what we see, it is clear that those who are negotiating are closer to winning,” Nagi said, “While those who are excluded from the talks are closer to losing.” ",1148,middleeast,2023-04-14,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/middleeast/yemen-saudi-houthi-interview-mime-intl/index.html

      UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak rocked by resignation of top ally Raab over bullying allegations
    ","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak suffered a serious blow to his premiership on Friday as one of his closest allies resigned over allegations he bullied officials. In a resignation letter posted on Twitter on Friday, Dominic Raab said he decided to quit as deputy prime minister and justice secretary after an official inquiry found some of the claims made against him were justified. Sunak said he accepted Raab’s resignation with “great sadness,” and later replaced as deputy PM with Oliver Dowden. The review into Raab, conducted by independent investigator Adam Tolley, followed eight formal complaints about his behavior while acting as foreign secretary, Brexit secretary and justice secretary. “I called for the inquiry and undertook to resign, if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. I believe it is important to keep my word,” he said. He added that the inquiry into the allegation “dismissed all but two of the claims leveled against me” and “concluded I has not once, in four and a half years, sworn or shouted at anyone, let alone thrown anything or otherwise physically intimidated anyone, nor intentionally sought to belittle anyone.” The report, published in full after Raab’s resignation on Friday, concluded that “he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. It also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates.” It went on to say that Raab’s “conduct was experienced as undermining or humiliating by the affected individual, which was inevitable. It is to be inferred that [Raab] was aware that this would be the effect of his conduct; at the very least, he should have been aware.” Raab also said he believed the report sets a “dangerous precedent in setting the threshold for bullying so low” and said its findings were “flawed.” Raab held several high-profile posts since joining the government as a junior minister in 2015. Besides serving as deputy prime minister, he was also the justice secretary and Lord Chancellor in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government. He was the foreign secretary during the Boris Johnson era, but was removed after receiving heavy criticism following the UK withdrawal from Afghanistan. He was on holiday in Greece as the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. He faced demands for his resignation after it emerged that not long before the fall of Kabul, he asked a deputy to handle an urgent call with the Afghan foreign minister regarding the evacuation of interpreters who had worked with British armed forces. The call never took place. Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, criticized Sunak for letting Raab resign, rather than firing him. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Starmer said the decision showed “weakness from top to bottom” of the government. “There’s a double weakness here. He should never have appointed him and then he didn’t sack him,” he added. Raab’s resignation is a blow for Sunak who, despite coming from the right of the Conservative party himself, has been painted as softer than his predecessors Liz Truss and Johnson. The Johnson comparison is particularly pertinent as Sunak served as his Chancellor of the Exchequer during the Covid pandemic, only to offer his resignation as scandals engulfed the then-prime minister. Johnson allies believe that Sunak’s resignation ultimately led to the end of his premiership and have not forgiven him. Raab, who reminded Sunak in his resignation letter that he has been loyal since Sunak’s failed leadership bid last summer, is seen as a firm Brexiteer and a cornerstone of the right of the party. He got the attention of the Euroskeptic movement in 2014 when he led a rebellion of 81 MPs against then PM and ardent Europhile David Cameron. Raab bolstered Sunak’s right-wing credentials, helping to push through policies that required bringing that section of the party with him. And while Raab has promised his loyalty to Sunak, former ministers are able to create trouble on the backbenches, if they wish to. The question now is whether or not Raab wants to do this. He is sincerely loyal to Sunak and understands that Sunak really is a political ally to the right of the party. However, his resignation letter implies that Raab was very unhappy that he had to leave government. The coming days will tell us more about the extent to which Raab was pushed or jumped. If it’s the former, he could have reason to make life difficult for Sunak later down the line when he struggles with Johnson allies on the right of the party. Raab is the second Sunak ally to resign over bullying claims in less than six months. Cabinet office minister Gavin Williamson resigned from his role in November over accusations, which he denied.

      Coronation mishaps King Charles III will want to avoid
    ","Arson. Bumbling bishops. A jilted spouse banging on the abbey door. These may sound like plot lines from “Days of Our Lives,” but they are actually moments that have punctuated British coronations throughout history. Coronations at Westminster Abbey go back almost one thousand years. They have become a well-rehearsed, finely tuned machine. Yet, despite all the pomp and ceremony, there have been times when they have gone disastrously wrong. George Gross, a visiting research fellow at King’s College London and co-founder of the British Coronations Project, tells CNN that the crowning of William the Conqueror on Christmas Day, 1066, “sets the tone” for coronations ever since. Gross says William married the Saxon traditions of the nation he had conquered with the Norman traditions of his homeland, and his firm grip on power solidified them in English culture. But while his reign may have been a success, the coronation itself was a disaster. Like Charles III, William had his coronation at Westminster Abbey. This was also where his vanquished foe Harold Godwinson, killed at the Battle of Hastings, had been crowned just months before. The atmosphere both inside and outside the abbey was tense, coming so soon after William had earned his conqueror moniker. When those inside the abbey enthusiastically proclaimed “God save the King,” the noise reached such a level that William’s guards outside believed an assassination attempt must be underway. They then proceeded to take the only rational course of action – promptly burning down a number of buildings in the local area. George IV’s coronation in 1821 featured drama that would make the writers of most soap operas blush. The King had decided to exclude his wife, Queen Caroline, from the service. According to Gross, the reason for this royal snub was simple: “He wanted nothing to do with her.” In 1795, Parliament had forced George to marry his German cousin, Caroline of Brunswick, in exchange for clearing his large debts. He had already married another woman, Maria Fitzherbert, but that union was deemed unlawful as it did not have the consent of his father. George reportedly arrived at his wedding drunk, and the couple are believed to have only spent two nights together, during which time they conceived an heir. He refused to live in the same location as her and the couple quickly became estranged. In the intervening years before his coronation, George tried to secure a divorce from Parliament. Caroline was even subjected to a parliamentary trial investigating her alleged adultery during which she was not allowed to speak. But, partly because Caroline was popular with the public, George’s quest was thwarted. Such were the hostilities within the marriage, George didn’t even want his wife to be crowned, and he ordered those guarding the entrances to Westminster Abbey during his 1821 coronation to refuse her entry. Despite trying every entrance to the Abbey, she was not able to make it inside and had to leave. She died within a month. Gross said the public had grown to sympathize deeply with Caroline, and her death coming so soon after the coronation may have limited the negative impact this very public snubbing had on George’s reign. Queen Victoria’s 63-year reign helped solidify Britain’s position as the dominant power on the world stage. She built alliances by marrying her children off to monarchies across Europe, oversaw a massive expansion of the British Empire and was proclaimed Empress of India. Her reign left a legacy that has helped define Britain’s place in the world to this day, but her coronation was only slightly less chaotic than William’s. Aged just 18 when she became Queen in 1837, the young monarch was left awestruck the following year by the huge crowds who had gathered to catch a glimpse of her procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey, with an estimated 400,000 people gathered along the route. During the five-hour ceremony, Victoria was left in agony when the Archbishop of Canterbury forced the coronation ring onto the wrong finger. The Queen herself wrote of the incident, saying she had “the greatest difficulty in taking it off again, which I at last succeeded in doing, but not without great pain.” The whole ceremony was also poorly rehearsed, with Victoria writing that the Archbishop was “so confused and puzzled and knew nothing.” Thinking the ordeal was over, she left the ceremony, only to be rushed back into the abbey because the Bishop of Bath and Wells had accidentally omitted the section of the service in which she officially became Queen. Later, when the Lords were being presented to her, the elderly and aptly named Lord Rolle tripped and tumbled down a set of steps. The coronation of Victoria’s son Edward in 1902 wasn’t exactly a smooth affair, either. The ceremony had already been delayed because the King had fallen seriously ill. When the coronation eventually took place, it was overseen by Archbishop of Canterbury Frederick Temple, who was in his 80s. After kneeling to pay homage to the King, he was unable to get back up and had to be hauled to his feet by his fellow bishops. While mistakes are still made, modern royal occasions are generally more polished affairs. Gross says that, while earlier royal events were rehearsed to a degree, “there was a general assumption, largely because coronations were much more frequent, that people really knew what they were doing.” But, the thing that truly transformed the preparation that went into coronations was the advent of television. Prior to the broadcast of coronations and jubilees, blunders were still recorded, but they weren’t instantly available or truly accessible by the masses. Gross says television “completely changed things.” The good news is that coronation blunders are not necessarily a sign of future doom for monarchs. After all, there was little that went right during Queen Victoria’s coronation, but she is today remembered in Britain as one of its most successful monarchs. In a 2002 poll conducted by the BBC, she was listed as the 18th greatest ever Briton – the third highest monarch on the list. Gross says coronation blunders do not become truly significant for monarchs until their reign starts to go wrong. James II’s coronation in 1685 was punctuated by a number of mishaps, such as an ill-fitting and wobbly crown and the Royal Standard being torn by the wind from the Tower of London during the service. Despite this, Gross says, his coronation was viewed at the time as being quite successful. It was only later in his reign when he started facing rebellions that the coronation mishaps came to be seen as omens. The coronations of some of Britain’s most successful monarchs have faced challenges, while those for some of its most reviled royals have gone off without a hitch. With rehearsals ramping up in London and organizers working around the clock, it seems unlikely we’ll see a major blunder at Charles III’s coronation – but you’ll have to tune in to find out. Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Take That will headline the coronation concert on May 7 as part of the coronation celebrations. To be held in the grounds of Windsor Castle a day after the Westminster Abbey service, the concert will also feature international opera star Andrea Bocelli dueting with Grammy-winner Bryn Terfel, as well as singer-songwriter Freya Ridings performing alongside classical composer and pianist Alexis Ffrench. In addition to the famous faces, the Coronation Choir, a diverse group composed of community choirs and amateur singers from across the UK, will also perform. Acts will sing in front of 20,000 people, with millions more expected to tune in from home. Find out more about the musical spectacular here. Bottles of beer brewed 86 years ago for the coronation of Edward VIII, but which were left unopened upon the event’s cancellation, will go up for auction next month. Edward VIII ascended to the British throne in January 1936 upon the death of his father, George V, but abdicated in December of that year before his coronation so that he could marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The ale made to celebrate his crowning was therefore never sold – and only discovered 75 years later when work was being carried out in 2011 in the cellars of the Greene King brewery in the eastern English town of Bury St. Edmunds. Read more about the royal brew here. A “beautiful and symbolic” silver cross containing a piece of the so-called True Cross will lead King Charles’ coronation procession in London next month. The religious relic, believed by some to be a fragment of the cross on which Christ was crucified, was given to the King by Pope Francis to mark his coronation. The monarch commissioned the incorporation of the fragment into the newly created Cross of Wales, which he presented to the Church in Wales as a gift to mark its centenary, the Church announced Wednesday. Read the full story on CNN Style. Military personnel aren’t leaving anything to chance with next month’s coronation and have started doing late-night rehearsals for May 6. More than 6,000 men and women will take part in the coronation, in what is being billed as “the largest military ceremonial operation for 70 years.” Soldiers and aviators from both the UK and across the Commonwealth will participate in the two processions before and after the Westminster Abbey service. Following the processions, more than 60 aircraft from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force will conduct a fly-past over the Mall and Buckingham Palace. Meanwhile, gun salutes will sound from military bases and ships at sea to mark the moment Charles is crowned King. Kensington Palace has released a new photograph of the late Queen Elizabeth II to mark what would have been her 97th birthday. In a statement on Friday, the Palace said the photograph was taken by the Princess of Wales at Balmoral last summer. The photograph shows the beloved matriarch surrounded by some of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

      Queen Camilla’s son, Tom Parker Bowles, says his mother ‘married the person she loved’
    ","Tom Parker Bowles, the son of Britain’s Queen Camilla and her first husband, Andrew Parker Bowles, has said that his mother “married the person she loved.” Speaking two weeks before his mother is due to be crowned alongside King Charles III, food writer Parker Bowles told the News Agents podcast: “I don’t care what anyone says, this wasn’t any sort of endgame. She married the person she loved and this is what happened.” Camilla and Charles have been married since 2005. They reportedly met at a polo match in 1970 and became friends when Charles was a prince. Charles married Diana Spencer in 1981 but then admitted in 1994 that he had been having an extramarital affair with Camilla. Diana confirmed his infidelity and her own the following year. Parker Bowles’ remarks follow Prince Harry’s allegations that Camilla leaked stories about the family to the British media as part of her campaign to “rehabilitate her image” after she had been cast as a “villain” by the press for her role in the collapse of his parents’ marriage. When asked by podcast hosts Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis if there was a “panic” regarding the widespread speculation about whether the Sussexes would attend the coronation, Parker Bowles replied: “That has nothing to do with me at all.” Charles and Camilla will be crowned on May 6 at Westminster Abbey, a historic event marked by three days of celebrations across the country. “I think anyone would be anxious in an occasion of this sort of importance,” Parker Bowles said. “I’d be terrified if I had to walk up wearing ancient robes. She’s tough but she’s 75, and it’s tough to do it. But she’s never complained, she’ll just get on and do it.” Parker Bowles’ son Freddy will also play a role in the coronation as one of his grandmother’s four pages of honor, alongside his cousins and second cousin. “I don’t think he knows quite how big it’s going to be,” Parker Bowles said when asked about his son’s reaction. “I don’t think he has any sense of the occasion. He’s a 13-year-old boy who loves football, Spurs supporter.” He added: “There are a lot of rehearsals that are going to happen before and he is doing it with his cousins – his two best mates – and another second cousin, so they all know each other.” Parker Bowles’ own role in the coronation will be smaller and he said he won’t appear on the balcony alongside the royal family. “We’re just there to support our mother,” he added.

      Biden team works to finalize reelection plans as polls show tepid support for a 2024 bid
    ","President Joe Biden’s advisers are moving quickly to finalize staffing and operational details of his reelection campaign ahead of what’s widely expected to be a bruising 19-month effort to convince the public of his accomplishments and his ability to serve well into his eighties. Biden returned to the White House late Sunday from a weekend at Camp David designed to serve as an intensive runthrough of campaign and personnel planning, including matters still requiring his final approval, people familiar with the matter said. But even as officials made final edits to an announcement video likely to be released Tuesday, marking four years since Biden declared himself a candidate in the 2020 presidential election, the challenges of the upcoming contest were coming into sharper view. An NBC News poll released Sunday found just 26% of Americans think Biden should run for a second term as president, while 70% say he should not. Among Democrats, 51% say Biden should not run for a second term. That mirrors the findings of other recent polls showing tepid support for a Biden reelection bid, including an AP-NORC poll released Friday and CNN polling released earlier this month. In the NBC poll, nearly half of those who oppose a Biden run say that his age is a major reason for that view. Advisers are confident those numbers will mean little in the long run. Republicans – and former President Donald Trump’s candidacy in particular – have “a pretty good track record of bringing our people back home – and out to vote,” one senior Democratic official close to the White House said. Biden’s advisers also believe his age represents decades of experience, which they say has driven legislative wins delivering tangible economic dividends across the country. “He is a steady hand, when you look at what’s out there right now with Donald Trump and what we’re hearing again. People don’t want that chaos back again,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, when asked by CNN’s Dana Bash about Biden’s age on “State of the Union.” Still, at 80, Biden’s age is certain to act as a central issue in the coming campaign, a fact even many of his Democratic allies privately acknowledge. News that Biden had decided to launch his reelection campaign this week came as a surprise to a slew of Democratic officials who had been led to believe in recent weeks that Biden was more likely to wait until the summer to announce his bid. For weeks, Biden advisers and others close to the White House had insisted the president felt no pressure to announce this spring and was keen to allow an increasingly contentious Republican primary to play out without being in the mix as an official candidate. But other factors also weighed on Biden’s advisers. A messy debt ceiling fight, anticipated this summer, would not be the ideal time to announce a reelection campaign. The president will travel abroad next month for summits in Japan and Australia, and he plans to travel overseas again in July for a NATO summit in Lithuania, squeezing the calendar. And high-dollar fundraising tends to be slower during the summer months, which could affect Democratic officials’ desire to deliver a strong first quarter haul for the reelection campaign. Advisers continued to caution that last-minute changes were possible. And while Biden has finished taping a video declaring his candidacy and outlining his argument for a second term, according to people familiar with the matter, aides warned the timing of its release could shift. As planning for the reelection launch came into public view in recent days, the number of candidates for campaign manager rapidly narrowed from more than a half-dozen to one name. Biden is poised to name Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a senior White House adviser, to oversee the campaign, two senior Democratic advisers told CNN on Sunday. The choice of campaign chief was among the many outstanding decisions Biden and his team were making as they prepare for the potentially imminent announcement. Rodriguez, a senior adviser to the president and director of the White House’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, has seen her star rise in Biden’s White House. Biden elevated Rodriguez to the role of senior adviser last summer, adding her to the small circle of his senior-most aides. While Rodriguez will formally manage the campaign, the effort will also be largely guided from the West Wing, where top aides Anita Dunn, Jen O’Malley Dillon, Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti will also play central roles. Rodriguez, the granddaughter of labor icon Cesar Chavez, has been a longtime Democratic adviser who is close to Biden. CBS News was first to report the expected decision. Biden will name Quentin Fulks, who ran Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock’s successful 2022 race, as his deputy campaign manager, according to two people briefed on the matter. Biden’s final weekend before the expected announcement served as a window into the balancing act to come as he and his top national security officials navigated the complexity of a potentially perilous evacuation of government personnel from the US embassy in war-ravaged Sudan. Biden has maintained privately that his primary focus is on carrying the duties of the job he was elected to do in 2020. He gave the order on Saturday to deploy roughly 100 US special operations troops to secure and complete the evacuation of US personnel in Sudan. The operation was successful and no US military and diplomatic personnel were harmed in the roughly hour-long process. It served as a real-time demonstration of how the next 19 months may unfold for the incumbent running for the White House, where there are no shortage of crises that can turn a message or campaign on its head seemingly overnight. It also provided a window into another Biden reality, people familiar with the matter said. He will have the ultimate say in the direction of things, even if that say takes longer than some in the party would prefer. That drove some on Biden’s team to warn allies that the Tuesday announcement wasn’t locked in until Biden gave the green light. The video had been filmed, they noted, and close advisers had accelerated their communications with party officials and donors in the lead up to the announcement. But Biden wasn’t pleased by leaks – and still had much to mull over and discuss about the shape of his nascent campaign over the course of the weekend.

      ‘Tennessee Three’ meets with Biden to discuss gun control
    ","President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with three Democratic Tennessee lawmakers at the White House on Monday, after the trio faced expulsion votes over their act of protest advocating for gun control. In the Oval Office, Biden told the Tennessee lawmakers, “If you stand up for kids, you’re standing up our communities and democratic values.” The three Democrats – Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson – were each subject to an ouster vote by Tennessee Republican lawmakers earlier this month over their protest on the state House floor to advocate for gun control, where they used a bullhorn to address those in the room. The lawmakers’ act of protest and rare expulsions from the body’s Republican supermajority came days after a mass shooting at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead, including three 9-year-old students. Following the White House meeting, the lawmakers told reporters they discussed red flag laws, safe storage laws, an assault weapons ban and strengthening background checks during their time with the president. Pearson said the meeting focused on “the need to have more gun violence prevention” at the federal and state levels. In a resolution, state Republicans had accused the trio of “knowingly and intentionally” bringing “disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives” without being recognized to speak, CNN affiliate WSMV reported earlier this month. Jones and Pearson, who are Black, were forced out of the GOP-controlled legislature. Johnson, who is White, was not expelled. The expelled representatives called the expulsions undemocratic and racist. Jones and Pearson were each sent back to the Tennessee House on an interim basis after local boards in their constituencies voted to reappoint them. Biden on Monday called the Republican legislature’s actions “shocking,” “undemocratic” and “without any precedent.” He said that “nothing is guaranteed by Democracy,” and that “every generation has to fight for it.” “You all are doing just that,” the president added. In addition to talking with Biden about gun control, Jones told reporters that the lawmakers discussed how they want to “build out multiracial democracy and challenge these extreme voices.” In an interview with CNN on Sunday, the lawmakers – dubbed the “Tennessee Three” – told CNN’s Abby Phillip that they planned to ask Biden to declare a public health emergency on gun violence. “I think that we need an emergency response because we’re facing a crisis situation … we need the help from our national leaders because we’re in a state where the only action that our colleagues took in response to the mass shooting in Nashville was to expel the two youngest Black lawmakers and then to pass a law to protect gun manufacturers,” Jones told CNN. It’s a big ask for Biden, who has previously said he’s exhausted all the avenues at his disposal as president to stop gun violence. Biden, whose party no longer controls both chambers of Congress, has urged members on Capitol Hill to act. But after the Nashville shooting, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Washington were quick to concede that Congress was unlikely to move on substantive gun control efforts. The president has taken more than 20 executive actions on guns since taking office, including regulating the use of “ghost guns” and sales of stabilizing braces that effectively turn pistols into rifles. He also signed a bipartisan bill in 2022 which expands background checks and provides federal funding for so-called red flag laws – although it failed to ban any weapons and fell far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for. The Tennessee trio all spoke to Biden during the expulsion vote earlier this month. In that conversation, Biden “thanked them for their leadership in seeking to ban assault weapons,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said after the conversation. Harris traveled to Nashville earlier this month to advocate for stricter gun control measures and also privately met with Jones, Pearson and Johnson. While Biden is expected to announce his 2024 reelection campaign as soon as Tuesday, Pearson noted to reporters that it did not come up during their meeting. Instead, he said, “we talked about resurrection of a movement around commonsense gun laws, we talked about this resurgence of hope in a state that is challenging these extreme special interests.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

      ‘He’s lost that old twinkle:’ When a young Joe Biden criticized his opponent’s age
    ","President Joe Biden, who at 80 has had to confront questions about his age and mental acuity as he is poised to launch a reelection campaign for president, once ran a campaign that sharply attacked his opponent’s age. In 1972, Biden, then 29 years old and a local Delaware councilman, was running against incumbent Republican Sen. Cale Boggs who was 63 years old, a former two term governor and the state’s senior senator. “Cale doesn’t want to run, he’s lost that old twinkle in his eye he used to have,” Biden said of Boggs, who had originally wanted to retire but was persuaded to run for reelection. Biden used his opponent’s age against him in a way that was so explicit, one local reporter dubbed his approach, “Dear old dad.” Biden was running to become one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Now, the president is already the oldest person ever to serve in the office of the presidency, and, if reelected, would leave office at the age of 86. That would best the next oldest president by more than 9 years if he served a full second term. The president’s age has been “omnipresent” in nearly every conversation, CNN reported in February, though that notion was disputed by a White House spokesperson. In response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN that Biden has made “historic progress” that has been “enthusiastically welcomed by younger Americans – including his unprecedented investments in fighting climate change, his first-of-its kind police reform executive order, his actions to support community policing and decriminalize marijuana, and getting more Americans health coverage than ever before.” In 1972, advertisements for Biden in local newspapers and on the radio hammered home a line, “he understands what’s happening today.” The ads targeted Boggs’ age by bringing up past historical topics from Bogg’s “generation,” like Joseph Stalin ruling Russia, jazz musicians using heroin, the development of the polio vaccine, and taxes from the 1940s. “Cale Boggs’ generation dreamed of conquering polio, Joe Biden’s generation dreams of conquering heroin,” read one newspaper ad. “To Cale Boggs an unfair tax was the 1948 poll tax. To Joe Biden an unfair tax is the 1972 income tax,” read another. One radio advertisement targeted Boggs as too focused on past threats from Russia, while ignoring domestic issues like crime. “One of the biggest differences between Cale Boggs and Joe Biden is the things they worry about,” said the radio ad. “In Cale Boggs’ day when Stalin ruled, Americans had visions of the Russian soldiers in our streets. In Joe Biden’s day, Americans have visions of American criminals in our streets. Joe Biden, he understands what’s happening today.” The approach drew pushback from Sen. William Roth, a Delaware Republican who Biden would work closely with for the next 30 years, according to the News Journal, and commentary from the media at the time. Biden eventually won that race with the Associated Press declaring, “Biden stressed age to defeat Boggs.” As Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Norm Lockman wrote, “The new campaign strategy, ordered by Biden himself, eases off the strident tub-thumping and finger pointing and uses an approach that says, in effect, “Dear old dad may have been right for his time - and I love him - but things are different now.’” ",557,politics,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/joe-biden-age-criticism-kfile/index.html

      Election 2024: A consequential rematch of serial candidates
    ","This could be the most consequential rematch in US history – a president who portrays himself as the champion of democracy against a former president who routinely rejects election results. Anyone fearing Donald Trump’s return and those who reject Joe Biden’s victory could agree that nothing less than the future of the republic is at stake if Biden and Trump are on the ballot in 2024. So why does it feel like an unwanted movie sequel - same actors, predictable new plot twist? Biden will have been a candidate on the national stage in five of the last ten presidential elections. His first and second presidential campaigns sputtered in Democratic primaries in 1988 and 2008. He ran as Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008 and 2012. After sitting out 2016, Biden returned on a mission to unseat Trump in 2020. Now the oldest-ever president, he’ll be asking voters to put him in the White House until after his 86th birthday. Trump is already on his third straight election campaign. And let’s not forget he teased runs in 1988, when Biden launched his first failed bid, and also in 2000, when Trump left the GOP for a time, and in 2012, when he led the charge questioning, incorrectly, Obama’s citizenship. Candidates who run three or more times don’t often successfully become president. One successful example is Ronald Reagan, who like Biden and Trump was technically a senior citizen when he took office. Reagan won his first term on his third try. He also overcame underwater first term approval ratings to win reelection. In fact, at this point, a little over two years into their presidencies, Biden, Trump and Reagan were all hovering around 40% approval, according to data maintained by Gallup. Both Biden and Trump are, for now, primed to stay on top for their parties. CNN’s Harry Enten looks at polling data to argue this could be the most “boring” presidential primary season ever. It’ll be boring not because it’s inconsequential, but because it currently lacks much excitement. Enten notes that Biden has not yet drawn a serious challenger and Trump has routinely enjoyed a sizable lead over declared and likely challengers. Explaining the current strength of Trump’s position in the GOP field, Enten points at national and early primary state polling and Trump’s growing quiver of endorsements: ENTEN: For an example of someone polling like Trump is now and then losing the party nomination, you have to look at primaries involving an incumbent. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary to President Jimmy Carter, despite easily leading him in polling at this point in the cycle. … This time around, Trump already has over 60 endorsements from governors and members of Congress. Since 1980, candidates with comparable collections of gubernatorial and congressional endorsements at this point in the cycle have all gone on to win their parties’ nominations. Those endorsements include a majority of the House delegation from Florida, Trump’s adoptive home state and also home to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has not officially launched a presidential campaign but is generally regarded as Trump’s top competition. During a trip to Japan, DeSantis was asked about polls that show him trailing Trump. “Well, I am not a candidate, so we’ll see if and when that changes,” DeSantis told reporters. This is the dichotomy of US politics. Biden and Trump are in positions of strength in their respective primaries at the same time they generate very little excitement for the public at large. Less than 40% of registered voters even say Biden deserves reelection in CNN polling from March. That means more than 60% of registered voters said he does not deserve reelection. It would be an extremely troubling figure for Biden supporters if Trump did not inspire equal frustration for a large portion of the country. While a small majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said in in March they would prefer the Democratic Party to nominate someone other than Biden in 2024, Biden has actually improved quite a bit on this question. Last summer it was three quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters who were hoping for an alternative. In the meantime, Democrats outperformed expectations and kept control of the US Senate after November’s midterm election. It’s also worth noting that most people who said they wanted to see a Biden alternative did not have a specific idea about who that alternative should be. Trump, unlike Biden, does face serious challengers for the GOP primary. DeSantis has benefited from a large amount of media attention, but still consistently trails Trump in primary polling. CNN’s Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg write about the difficulty Republican candidates have faced gaining traction against Trump despite his legal problems and his potential weakness in a general election campaign. From their report: Whether it’s a fear of alienating his core supporters or taking a social media drubbing, this new class of candidates – some officially in, others plotting their entry – has been careful in their remarks about Trump, largely steering clear of sharp criticism in favor of the occasional implicit jab, the kind that often fails to register with the average voter, or subtle indications of opposing policy views. An exception to that rule of Republicans treading carefully around Trump is former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. “The reruns will be worse than the original show was,” Christie said of a Trump primary nomination during an appearance in New Hampshire last week. Trump has also gained ground in recent serveys. Fewer than 40% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters wanted to see Trump nominated back in CNN’s December poll. By March, a slim majority in CNN’s poll said Trump should get the nod. A more recent poll published Monday, from NBC News, suggests Trump’s indictment on criminal charges by the Manhattan DA doesn’t appear to have hurt him among Republicans. Among those who say they would vote in the Republican presidential primary next year, 46% say they would back Trump out of a list of seven possible candidates, 31% choose DeSantis, and 6% former Vice President Mike Pence. All other candidates tested were at 3% or less. Winning a nomination is a far different thing than winning the presidential election, however. And majorities of Americans aren’t happy with either man – 60% of the population say in the NBC poll that Trump should not run. An even larger portion, 70%, say Biden should not run. Thus, the latest edition of a presidential election featuring Biden or Trump, will frustrate most of the country even as it is shaping up to be the most likely possible scenario.

      Biden says he’ll let people know ‘real soon’ about his reelection plans
    ","President Joe Biden said Monday that he would let people know “real soon” about his reelection plans –  stopping short of announcing another run during a White House ceremony honoring the 2023 Teacher of the Year recipients. Asked by reporters about his reelection plans, Biden responded: “I told you I’m planning on running. I’ll let you know real soon.” The president’s comments come amid heightened speculation that he could announce his campaign for reelection as soon as this week. During Monday’s Rose Garden ceremony, Biden called teaching a “difficult position that has gotten even harder,” zeroing-in on Republicans’ approach to education and gun safety. The president has used his administration’s executive authority to attempt to counter the growing number of conservative education-related policy efforts that have ignited cultural debate around the country in recent years – something he highlighted during Monday’s event. Biden scrutinized Republican efforts across the country to target LGBT students and teachers, saying, “Our schools should be places where everyone is safe and safe to be themselves … but across the country of late from some of our friends on the extreme right, LGBT students and teachers are under attack from hateful laws.” He also criticized efforts to ban certain books from schools and libraries, saying that “empty shelves don’t help kids learn very much.” “I never thought, as a student of history, I never thought I’d be a president whose fighting against elected officials trying to ban and banning books,” Biden said. “I’ve never met a parent wants a politician dictating what their kid can learn and what they can think, or who they can be.” He said “teachers now find themselves on the front lines, and gun violence is a real problem.” “We want to do more. I continue to call on Congress for common sense gun safety laws to protect kids and our teachers. Teaching should not be a life threatening profession, and educators should not need to be armed to feel safe in the classroom,” the president continued. The Council of Chief State School Officers’ 2023 National Teacher of the Year, Rebecka Peterson, has taught high school math classes for 11 years at Union High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She was previously the 2022 Oklahoma Teacher of the Year. Peterson, an immigrant of Swedish-Iranian descent, plans to use her platform as Teacher of the Year “to highlight teachers’ stories of the good that’s happening in education,” according to the CCSSO. “Teaching is a profession that affords creativity, autonomy and purpose, and Rebecka believes that highlighting the stories of joy happening in classrooms across the country will help encourage current teachers and attract new educators to the profession,” a CCSSO statement said, adding that Peterson’s lived experience “with supportive teachers who celebrated her diversity and math abilities informs Rebecka’s efforts to create a supportive and accessible classroom for students.” The Oklahoma educator has advocated for higher salaries to address teacher shortages among those teaching STEM courses, calling for higher salaries to bring more educators on board and address gender disparities in her field. “I’ve been asking teachers all over Oklahoma: How do we recruit and retain highly qualified educators, particularly in STEM? And pay certainly comes up every time, especially when we’re talking about recruiting,” Peterson told ABC News. Prior to her 11 years teaching high school math courses, Peterson taught for three years at the collegiate level. She holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Oklahoma Wesleyan University and a master’s degree in mathematics from the University of South Dakota. Last year, Biden honored Kurt Russell, an Ohio history instructor who teaches courses rooted in exploring oppression and Black history, as the 2022 Teacher of the Year.

      Hunter Biden’s lawyer seeks Treasury inspector general, congressional ethics inquiries as part of strategy to strike back at detractors
    ","Hunter Biden’s lawyer is asking for the Treasury Department’s inspector general and the Office of Congressional Ethics to launch inquiries as part of a broader aggressive strategy to strike back at detractors of President Joe Biden’s son. Abbe David Lowell, the lawyer for Hunter Biden, sent a letter to Deputy Inspector General Richard K. Delmar requesting a review of former Donald Trump aide Garrett Ziegler, who allegedly acquired and published online financial activities of Hunter Biden, known as Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). A source familiar with Biden’s legal team strategy says that Ziegler is currently a top focus. They recently filed a lawsuit accusing him of harassing Biden’s team. Lowell also sent a letter to Paul Vinovich, board chairman at the Office of Congressional Ethics, requesting an independent ethics review of GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s conduct for her public statements that “sound and read like school-yard insults rather than the work of a Member of Congress.” The Office of Congressional Ethics declined to comment. In recent months, as Republicans took control of the House and a federal criminal investigation of Hunter Biden appeared to stall, Biden’s legal team decided to pursue a more aggressive and litigious approach to his defense, despite what one source described as objections from top White House advisers. The latest salvos from Biden’s lawyer come as President Biden is expected to formally announce his bid for a second term as soon as this week. Also this week, Hunter Biden’s lawyers are scheduled to meet with Trump-appointed US attorney David Weiss and at least one senior career official from Justice Department headquarters to discuss a long-running investigation into the president’s son, CNN previously reported. Hunter Biden’s legal team requested the meeting several weeks ago to get an update on the case, multiple sources told CNN.  The meeting is described by sources as being routine and is not expected to reveal the final disposition of the criminal investigation. After prosecutors narrowed possible criminal charges Hunter Biden could face, sources told CNN, they were weighing whether to bring two misdemeanor charges for failure to file taxes, one count of felony tax evasion related to the overreporting of expenses, and a false statement charge regarding a gun purchase. This week’s meeting is the first public development in the case in nearly a year. Hunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes and has denied any wrongdoing. In his letter to the deputy inspector general of the Treasury Department, Lowell wrote that Ziegler “has stated that he worked (conspired) with a person or persons in a bank resulting in his illegally obtaining and then disclosing five SARs, which involve or concern Mr. Biden.” Lowell’s letter referenced public comments Ziegler made on Steve Bannon’s podcast in November 2022 when Ziegler said: “We have an insider at JP Morgan that gave us five suspicious activity reports. These are bank documents submitted to the U.S. Treasury Department. We redacted nothing.” Lowell argued that Ziegler’s public comments about working with a banker at JP Morgan violates the Bank Secrecy Act and could lead to “criminal penalties.” Ziegler also indirectly gave Biden’s suspicious activity reports to the House Oversight Committee, Lowell claimed. A Treasury official confirmed to CNN that the department’s office of inspector general is reviewing the letter. CNN has reached out to Ziegler’s lawyer. Such reports are not conclusive and do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. Financial institutions file millions of suspicious activity reports each year and few lead to law enforcement inquiries. Lowell wrote that “Ziegler has used Mr. Biden’s SARs and other financial records to craft a false narrative that Mr. Biden is associated with a human trafficking ring.” “On behalf of our client, I respectfully request that the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Treasury review and investigate how and with whom Ziegler acted or collaborated or conspired to obtain my client’s private financial records before illegally publishing them,” Lowell wrote. To the Office of Congressional Ethics, Lowell asked the independent entity to review and take action on Greene’s “suspected violations of House Ethics rules and standards of official conduct,” based on her “continuous verbal attacks, defamatory statements, publication of personal photos and data, and promotion of conspiracy theories about and against Robert Hunter Biden.” Lowell described the Georgia Republican’s online statements and public comments attacking the president’s son as “a spray of shotgun pellets of personal vitriol.” These statements, Lowell argued, do not serve a legislative purpose or oversight function, and should not just be seen as free speech because she often makes such claims from her official perch or through her work in Congress. The letter references Greene tweeting baselessly that Hunter Biden “engaged in an actual human trafficking ring” as well as her recent interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” where she said that Democrats support “grooming children” and that “even Joe Biden, the president himself, supports children being sexualized and having transgender surgeries. Sexualizing children is what pedophiles do to children.” Greene dismissed concerns brought forward by Biden’s counsel, saying in a tweet Monday that “the entire country is pissed off about your obvious influence peddling with your Daddy’s political power” and inviting him to speak with Republicans on the House Oversight Committee. Lowell also referenced a recent incident at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing where the panel’s Republican chairman silenced Greene from speaking further after she called Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas a “liar.” “In summary, the unmoored verbal abuses and ad hominem attacks against Mr. Biden are just a microcosm of Representative Greene’s numerous ethical violations and repeated lapses in ethical judgment, all of which warrant a review of her conduct,” Lowell wrote.

      Why 2024 could be the most boring presidential primary season ever
    ","For people who write about electoral, or “horse race,” politics, few things are more enjoyable than an exciting presidential primary season. Sometimes, both Democrats and Republicans cooperate by holding gripping fights for the party nods (see 2008). Sometimes, however, voters in both parties quickly coalesce around front-runners (see 2000). A look at the current dynamics in both parties suggests 2024 could be one of the most, if not the most, boring primary cycles in the last 50 years. Nothing is set in stone. Things can change when you least expect it, but it’s tough not to acknowledge the current facts. Let’s start on the Democratic side, where President Joe Biden is expected to announce as early as Tuesday that he is running for reelection. No incumbent president has lost a state primary (where he was on the ballot) since 1980. At this point, Biden doesn’t look likely to break that streak. He hasn’t attracted a challenger who would be considered serious under most metrics. Neither Marianne Williamson nor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ever held elected office. Williamson gained no traction during her 2020 presidential bid. Kennedy pushes debunked conspiracy theories about vaccine safety and is seeking votes from an electorate that is overwhelmingly vaccinated against Covid-19. The very limited polling so far shows Biden with a large advantage over Williamson and Kennedy. Perhaps more importantly, few Democratic elected officials have indicated anything other than loyalty to a 2024 Biden bid. That’s key for a few reasons. First, primary endorsements are as good a predictor at this point of primary success as polling is. Second, it’s true that Democratic primary voters tell pollsters they are open to listening to a credible challenger to Biden. The president, after all, would be 82 years old at the start of a potential second term. But as Billy Preston once sang, “Nothin’ from nothin’ leaves nothin’.” That polling hypothetical means nothing if no one with a base within the party runs. Biden’s strong approval rating among Democrats is well in line with that of previous incumbents who cruised to renomination. So it’s not like Democratic voters will be kicking and screaming if they have to support Biden for another term. On the Republican side, former President Donald Trump finds himself in his best position in a very long time to win the GOP nomination. I’m unaware of a single recent reliable national or early-voting-state-level poll that shows Trump with anything other than a “big league” edge over both declared and potential 2024 opponents. He’s regularly at around 50% in national surveys. This 50% is key because it’s so rare for someone to be polling at that level at this early juncture and not win the nomination. Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000, Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 were the sole candidates running in incumbent-free primaries who were near, at or above 50% in early national polling. All four of them were able to secure the nominations with relative ease, and Clinton was the only one who lost more than a handful of primary contests. For an example of someone polling like Trump is now and then losing the party nomination, you have to look at primaries involving an incumbent. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary to President Jimmy Carter, despite easily leading him in polling at this point in the cycle. It’s possible that since Trump is the first former president to actively seek a presidential nomination in over 80 years, the early national polling means less than it normally does. That said, Trump has more going for him than national polling. For one thing, his early-state-level polling looks as good as it has in a while. A University of New Hampshire poll released last week puts him up 20 points on Ron DeSantis in a hypothetical Granite State GOP primary, after he trailed the Florida governor by 12 points in January. This polling is supported by something that eluded Trump when he first ran for the presidency in 2015: endorsements from elected officials. Trump didn’t get his first one from a governor or member of Congress until after winning his first primary contest during the 2016 cycle. This time around, Trump already has over 60 endorsements from governors and members of Congress. Since 1980, candidates with comparable collections of gubernatorial and congressional endorsements at this point in the cycle have all gone on to win their parties’ nominations. Most impressive is what Trump has done in Florida. DeSantis would be Trump’s most serious challenger by far if he decides to run. He’s the only one breaking into double digits in the average national and early-state polling. Yet Trump has gone into Florida and already secured endorsements from a majority of Republicans in the state’s US House delegation. Some of those endorsements aren’t surprising (e.g., Rep. Matt Gaetz). Some of them are notable, such as Rep. Byron Donalds, who introduced DeSantis at his 2022 reelection victory party. Trump, like Biden, seems to have two things going for him: a large share of Republican voters and the party behind him. If those two were in opposition to each other, the primary season would have looked far more interesting. So unless something changes, we’re looking at a recipe for primary success for both the current president and the man he succeeded.

      How Elon Musk transformed Twitter’s blue check from status symbol into a badge of shame
    ","Days after Elon Musk’s Twitter purged blue check marks from VIP users and prominent organizations, the checks reappeared on the accounts of a number of high-profile figures, many of whom promptly stressed they did not ask for or did not want the new verification badge. Those in the latter camp include the rapper Lil Nas X, The New York Times, the scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the journalist Kara Swisher, and even the legendary satirical account @dril, to name a few. Even the accounts of public figures known to be deceased, including Bob Saget, Kirstie Alley and Barbara Walters, have had their verification restored, and it is unclear how many of those badges Twitter may be handing out at no charge. The spectacle only added to mounting chaos at Twitter and highlighted how Musk has helped erode the value of the blue check at precisely the moment he’s betting on it to help drive subscription revenue for his company after a massive drop in its core advertising business. Once a recognizable online status symbol that was universally understood to authenticate influential accounts on the platform, the blue check’s symbol has evolved into something more confusing thanks to Musk’s decision to make it available for a price. It has also become outright politicized and a kind of referendum on Musk himself, reflected in the recent dueling hashtags #paythe8, backed by supporters of the new-style verification, facing off against #blocktheblue, which represents its critics. Over the weekend, numerous high-profile people announced — with apparent despair — that they too had been “punished” with verification badges. Some, including actor Chrissy Teigen, reported difficulties trying to get the check mark removed, attempting to change their display names to get it to disappear. (Teigen ultimately succeeded.) “It attached itself to me,” Teigen tweeted of the badge. “How did it happen so fast. like the movie It Follows.” The celebrity backlash, combined with the fact that Twitter apparently had to restore some of the badges at its own initiative and expense, reflects not only massive gaps in Musk’s plan and execution, but also how isolated Musk is from many of the celebrity users whose content has long kept Twitter afloat. The week after buying Twitter for $44 billion, Musk denounced the platform’s legacy approach to verifying celebrities, news organizations and government accounts. “Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bull***t,” Musk declared in November, announcing a plan to offer verified badges to any user who paid a monthly fee. “Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.” Musk decision to move forward with this plan, first by rolling out a paid verification option as part of the company’s subscription product Twitter Blue, and now by removing legacy blue checks from accounts, has seemingly led to unintended consequences at every step, including a wave of troubling impersonations and the potential for new scams and misinformation. His attempts to address these unforced errors has led him back to the very system he supposedly abolished — one in which Twitter unilaterally decides who is worthy or important enough to receive a verified badge. The major difference now is that Musk gets to call the shots. But in the process, he has made verification an even less transparent and meaningful indicator. Instead of conveying authenticity, Twitter verification is now fraught with multiple conflicting messages. Depending on the context, verification can now reflect a kind of loyalty pledge, a signal of proud support for the direction Musk is taking the company. Or, for some who did not want a badge but received one anyway, it reflects a kind of shame or embarrassment, a distinct sense of un-coolness. For still others, it is a suckers’ mark, a symbol of gullibility and subservience. “So, how do all the Musk fanboys and MAGA folks on this site feel about the fact that your conquering hero said he’d bring ‘equality’ and ‘people power’ to this site and then charged you all for Twitter Blue while giving it to people like me for free?” tweeted MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan. “Do you feel… owned?” The refusal of high-profile users to pay for verification is forcing Musk to pivot in ways that directly undermine the egalitarianism he claims to promote and raise questions about Twitter’s long-term potential to generate revenue. For weeks, many legacy verified users had signaled they would not be paying for Twitter Blue. The list of the unwilling included institutional users such as The New York Times as well as individuals such as the actor William Shatner. When the change finally went into effect on Thursday, Musk’s anticipated wave of subscriptions did not immediately pan out. According to independent researcher Travis Brown, who has been keeping a running tally of paying Twitter users, the past few days have resulted in a net increase of just 12,000 Twitter Blue accounts, for a total of 551,517. By comparison, Twitter’s last publicly disclosed figures before it went private reported more than 237 million active users. Some of those refusing to pay included LeBron James, Stephen King and Shatner. So Musk said he was comping their subscriptions, and only theirs. But that claim proved short-lived. Accounts belonging to everyone from President Joe Biden to Pope Francis also had their verification status restored, marking them as “a government or multilateral organization account.” And over the weekend, the checks once again appeared on the accounts of influential users who claimed not to have paid for them, creating the false perception that they had. New York City journalist Pat Kiernan, in describing his struggles to delete the new badge, has called it a thing of “regret” and “the opposite of desirable.” Put differently, changes to the badge’s substantive meaning did nothing to reduce the arbitrariness of the labeling but also led to the complete collapse of the badge’s cultural currency. And that is no small thing when Musk has tied the fate of the platform to subscription revenue. Musk’s initial plan appears to have been dependent on leveraging verification’s existing cachet as a status symbol to drive subscriptions. There are other features of Twitter’s subscription product, including the ability to edit tweets, but the paid verification option is a key selling point. But the very act of changing what verification meant has fundamentally transformed the badge’s value proposition into something few people appear to, well, value. Supporters of the new verification system have criticized those unwilling to pay as cheapskates or worse, and the argument would have an internal sort of logic if the new product did the same thing as the old product. What Musk is selling instead is a different product, and the result is nothing more than the free market’s collective shrug. Perhaps there was never going to be a world where high-profile accounts simply went unverified. After all, Musk needs famous people to be verified so that when users are shown Twitter’s algorithmically assembled For You feed by default, there will be quality content there for them to interact with. It doesn’t benefit Twitter for celebrity accounts to be buried along with the other non-paying accounts Musk has said the platform will demote. And that highlights the nagging problem Musk cannot escape: Despite his populist rhetoric, Musk’s backtracking on verification is yet another reminder that the internet and social media are not the democratizing force Silicon Valley keeps insisting it is, but a reincarnation of all the existing power structures and influence centers of the physical world. Some people really are so important that you’d want viewers to know it’s really them, payment or not. As if to underscore the issue, when Fox News and show host Tucker Carlson cut ties on Monday, it was a dramatic news event that seemed tailor-made for the real-time Twitter commentary that has always been central to the platform’s appeal. But instead of helping to drive engagement, the new verification system just seemed to get in the way, as some users expressed initial doubt as to whether the journalist accounts reporting the news were authentic.

      ‘Too good to be true?’ As Shein and Temu take off, so does the scrutiny
    ","Temu and Shein are taking off in the United States, topping app stores and creating a frenzy with consumers. But as the two online shopping platforms become hugely popular, they’re also facing questions over a litany of issues, including how they’re able to sell goods at such strikingly low prices, how transparent they are with the public and how much environmental waste their businesses generate. Some of those questions aren’t unique to the two companies: Longtime fast-fashion producers like Zara or H&M
            
                (HNNMY) have faced similar concerns. But in recent weeks, Temu and Shein have also faced greater scrutiny over their ties to China, the country where their businesses originated and where they continue to rely on manufacturers. Shein was started in China, while Temu was launched by a Chinese company that now bills itself as a multinational firm. They are based in Singapore and Boston, respectively. That may matter little to policymakers. As US-China tensions remain high, American legislators have increased attempts to restrict technology linked in any way to foreign entities. Earlier this month, a US congressional commission called out Shein and Temu in a report that suggested the companies and others in China were potentially linked to the use of forced labor, exploitation of trade loopholes, product safety hazards or intellectual property theft. Both firms have enjoyed major success in the United States, noted Nicholas Kaufman, a policy analyst for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. This “has encouraged both established Chinese e-commerce platforms and startups to copy their model, posing risks and challenges to US regulations, laws, and principles of market access,” he wrote. “Like Shein, Temu’s success raises flags about its business practices,” Kaufman added. Asked about the report, Shein said in a statement that it “takes visibility across our supply chain seriously.” “For over a decade, we have been providing customers with on-demand and affordable fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products, lawfully and with full respect for the communities we serve,” a spokesperson said. Temu did not respond to a request for comment. Temu and Shein have taken the world’s largest retail market — the United States — by storm. Temu, which runs a marketplace for virtually everything from home goods to apparel to electronics, was launched by PDD Holdings
            
                (PDD) last year. It has quickly become the most downloaded app in the United States, and continues to expand its user base. PDD was founded in China but recently began billing itself as a Cayman Islands company, citing a new corporate registration there. As of a February regulatory filing, PDD’s head office was in Shanghai. Temu says it doesn’t operate in China. PDD also owns Pinduoduo, a hugely popular Chinese e-commerce giant that was found in a recent CNN investigation to have the ability to spy on its users. According to cybersecurity researchers, Pinduoduo can circumvent users’ mobile security to see what they’re doing on other apps, read their messages and even change settings. While Temu has not been implicated, the allegations about its sister company have invited further scrutiny and were cited in the Congress report on Temu this month. PDD did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for comment on the investigation. Shein, which was founded by Chinese entrepreneur Chris Xu, has enjoyed similar success with its app over the last few years. The company initially created a cult following for its fast-fashion apparel and has since branched out into other offerings, such as home goods. Both companies have gained traction stateside by offering extreme bargains to shoppers, many of whom continue to feel the squeeze from historically high inflation. “The timing is very advantageous,” said Michael Felice, an associate partner in Kearney’s communications, media and technology practice. “You have extreme pressure on the consumer wallet right now.” While Temu and Shein may appear similar, they have different business models. Temu operates as an online store, carrying merchandise from independent sellers. Shein, on the other hand, commissions its own goods through manufacturers it teams up with in what is effectively seen as a supersonic version of fast fashion. For some consumers, the companies’ low prices have raised eyebrows. “I think transparency and traceability of product is becoming more important,” said Felice. “When you’re starting to see price points that almost could be too good to be true, you start to ask yourself, ‘Is that too good to be true?’” Felice also said there was a risk of Temu facing resistance from US consumers as a cross-border business. “There’s a rising sense of nationalism in markets,” he said. “It will be interesting to see which one wins as the dual pressures of inflation and nationalism take hold on American consumers.” Lawmakers are also getting more hawkish. While both Temu and Shein have taken steps to separate their businesses from links to China, geopolitical tensions are proving hard to shake off. Last month, a bipartisan group of US senators introduced legislation that would give the government new powers, including a ban on foreign-linked producers of software. In a fact sheet distributed by lawmakers, Temu’s surge on US app stores was described as an example of how Chinese consumer technology was becoming more popular. “From the history of the companies to where their products come from, it’s very hard to say you’re not related to China,” said Sheng Lu, an associate professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware. Similar to TikTok, which faces the prospect of a US ban, Lu believes that Temu and Shein could face data privacy concerns from regulators. “They’re large, influential and collect data,” he said. “This can make the companies a potential sensitive topic.” The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Around 85% of clothing ends up in landfills or is burned. Experts say the problem is even worse with fast fashion, defined as the rapid design and production of cheap and low-quality goods that respond to fleeting trends. These are “disposable fashion companies,” said Maxine Bédat, founder of the New Standard Institute. “That’s the crux of what they are. This stuff is not meant to last in your wardrobe,” she added. “Their business wouldn’t function if it did.” Shein argues that its business model enables it to reduce waste and overproduction by producing small batches and only responding with larger production if demand is shown. The company has set a goal of reducing emissions by 25% by 2030, based on 2021 figures. Temu, which markets itself more as a general store than a fashion outlet, also said its model limits unsold inventory and waste by better matching demand with supply. The company told CNN it offsets emissions for every order with “carbon credits which support wildlife conservation efforts” in the United States, though it did not provide details. Researchers who study textile waste and sustainability in global supply chains say the companies need to go further. Shein, for example, often uses low-cost fabrics that are hard to recycle. Compared with other fashion retailers, the company has a much lower percentage of products that mention using sustainable or recycled textile materials, said Lu. There are also concerns about the conditions of workers who make some of the companies’ products. In February, a bipartisan group of US senators wrote to Shein, pressing the company on its supply chain practices and calling for greater transparency in its supply chain. “We are concerned that American consumers may be inadvertently purchasing apparel made in part with cotton grown, picked, and processed using forced labor,” the senators said. The inquiry was made following a Bloomberg report showing lab testing on two occasions last year found that garments shipped to the United States by Shein were made with cotton from Xinjiang. Washington has banned all imports from the Chinese region over concerns of forced labor. In a statement to CNN, Shein said it was committed to respecting human rights and adhering to laws and regulations in the countries where it operates. A spokesperson said the company had zero tolerance for forced labor, and worked with third parties to audit supplier factories. To ensure compliance with US laws, Shein requires that suppliers purchase cotton from approved countries, and has built tracing systems to get visibility into the origins of cotton it uses, the spokesperson added. Temu has not faced such questions, though its sister company received backlash in 2021 over allegations that it overworks its staff. Pinduoduo said at the time that it would provide counseling following the suicide of a worker. Worker rights at Shein also made headlines in December, when a documentary by UK broadcaster Channel 4 alleged exploitation at two Chinese factories belonging to its suppliers. The program claimed staff were working 18 hours a day, making the equivalent of pennies on each item. CNN has not independently verified the allegations. Shein responded to the claims, saying independent audits had refuted most of the allegations. But it conceded that the investigation had showed workers at two of its suppliers were working longer hours than allowed. The company has since reduced the size of its orders from those producers on an interim basis, and committed $15 million to upgrade hundreds of its partner factories. Still, the “working conditions of workers making Shein’s products remain a black box,” said Lu, the University of Delaware professor. “Shein should be more transparent about their factory conditions and workers’ well-being.” ",1576,tech,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/tech/temu-shein-us-concerns-intl-hnk/index.html

      How to protect yourself from iPhone thieves locking you out of your own device
    ","A complex but concerning method of gaining control over a user’s iPhone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise. Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Some victims also told the publication their bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps. It’s important to note, however, this type of takeover is hard to pull off. It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device’s passcode – for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. And that’s all before they physically steal the device. From there, a thief could use the passcode to change the device’s Apple ID, turn off “Find my iPhone” so their location can’t be tracked, and then reset the recovery key, a complex 28-digit code intended to protect its owners from online hackers. Apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an Apple ID in an effort to bolster the user’s security, but if a thief changes it, the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account. “We sympathize with people who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We work tirelessly every day to protect our users’ accounts and data, and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one.” On its website, Apple warns “you’re responsible for maintaining access to your trusted devices and your recovery key. If you lose both of these items, you could be locked out of your account permanently.” Jeff Pollard, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the company should offer more customer support options and “ways for Apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings.” For now, however, there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them. The first step is protecting the passcode. An Apple spokesperson told CNN people can use Face ID or Touch ID when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching. Users can also set up a longer, alphanumeric passcode that’s harder for bad actors to figure out. Device owners should also change the passcode immediately if they believe someone else has seen it. Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that’s been circulating online. Within an iPhone’s Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they could successfully change an Apple ID. By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password. Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone – via iCloud or iTunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox. This won’t stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device, but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen.

      Lyft plans to ‘significantly reduce’ workforce, CEO says
    ","Lyft
            
                (LYFT) plans to “significantly reduce” its workforce, the company’s new CEO David Risher told employees on Friday, in another round of layoffs as it struggles to turn a profit and pull off a turnaround. In a company-wide memo, Risher said the cuts were aimed at making Lyft a “faster, flatter company where everyone is closer to our riders and drivers.” “I own this decision, and understand that it comes at an enormous cost,” Risher continued. “We’re not just talking about team members; we’re talking about relationships with people who’ve worked (and played) together, sometimes for years.” The announcement follows Lyft’s move in November to cut 13% of its workforce, citing fears of a looming recession. The Wall Street Journal reported that the latest job cuts would eliminate at least 1,200 positions or upward of 30% of its staff. A Lyft spokesperson declined to provide details on the extent of the cuts. “David has made clear to the company that his focus is on creating a great and affordable experience for riders and improving drivers’ earnings,” the spokesperson said. “To do so requires that we reduce our costs and structure our company so that our leaders are closer to riders and drivers. This is a hard decision and one we’re not making lightly. But the result will be a far stronger, more competitive Lyft.” Lyft announced last month that Risher, an Amazon veteran, would take over as CEO in April, and that co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer will step down from their management positions at the ride-hailing company. Risher was the 37th employee of Amazon – a company that has long been the model for the on-demand industry – and he went on to become the e-commerce giant’s first head of product and head of US retail. For Lyft and Risher, the current challenges are immense. While Uber diversified its business beyond ride-hailing by delivering meals and grocery items, Lyft never did. That arguably hurt the company earlier in the pandemic when fewer customers were traveling but more were ordering items online. Now Uber is showing renewed strength In its most recent earnings report, Uber said that it had its “strongest quarter ever,” reporting a 49% year-over-year increase in revenue. Lyft’s latest earnings report, meanwhile, was unusually disappointing for Wall Street. Lyft shares were up 6% in midday trading Friday, but the company’s stock is down roughly 70% over the past year. – CNN’s Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report.

      Twitter descends into chaos as news outlets and brands lose verification
    ","Twitter users awoke Friday morning to even more chaos on the platform than they had become accustomed to in recent months under CEO Elon Musk after a wide-ranging rollback of blue check marks from celebrities, journalists and government agencies. The end of traditional verification marked the beginning of a radically different information regime on Twitter, one highlighted by almost immediate impersonations of government accounts; the removal of labels previously used to identify Chinese and Russian propaganda; and a scramble by the company to individually re-verify certain high-profile figures such as Pope Francis. A broad array of media organizations lost the gold verification badges Musk’s team had developed months earlier as an alternative to traditional brand verification, reflecting those organizations’ apparent refusal to pay for the badges that now cost $1,000 a month. Several prominent Twitter users including LeBron James, William Shatner and Stephen King also refused to pay to keep their verification badges, prompting Musk to personally intervene. Appearing to sense the problems that might ensue if those users went unverified, Musk said Thursday he would pay out of his own pocket to ensure James, Shatner and King’s profiles continued to be verified. Though some of the most visible issues with the rollout could be ironed out in the coming days, the broader impact of the change has been to make it more difficult for users to determine an account’s authenticity and potentially to undermine Twitter’s central role as a hub for news. Twitter verification is no longer an indicator that an account represents who it claims to represent; instead, it reflects that a user – or, apparently, the owner of Twitter – paid for Twitter Blue, the company’s subscription service. Earlier experiments with changes to verification had led to similar chaos, prompting Twitter to postpone the rollout multiple times. Twitter continued to move forward with its paid verification strategy, however, with the hope of bolstering subscription revenue after seeing a sharp decline in its core ad sales business. After Thursday’s change removed verification from New York City’s official government account, the account tweeted Thursday evening: “This is an authentic Twitter account representing the New York City Government.” Later, another Twitter account bearing the same profile image and a slight variation on the official account’s username replied to that tweet. “No, you’re not,” the impostor account said. “THIS account is the only authentic Twitter account representing and run by the New York City Government.” By Friday morning, the city’s verification had been restored with a gray check mark indicating it was a “government or multilateral organization account.” The same had occurred with Pope Francis, who had also lost his blue check mark Thursday. In a seemingly unrelated and coincidental change, Twitter also stripped the “government-funded media” label from accounts belonging to Canada’s CBC and NPR, the latter of which had quit Twitter over the labeling because NPR said the label misrepresented the news organization’s editorial independence from the US government. Twitter also removed the “state-affiliated media” labels from accounts belonging to China’s Xinhua News and Russia’s RT. According to NPR, Musk dropped all media labeling on Twitter following a suggestion from the author Walter Isaacson, who is writing a biography of Musk. Isaacson, who is verified on Twitter as a subscriber to Twitter Blue, tweeted a photo of Musk on Thursday from SpaceX’s Starship launch site. The rocket exploded in midair.

      White House begins early planning for 6G development
    ","The White House plans to meet on Friday with government officials, business leaders and members of the academic community to discuss strategies for building out next-generation 6G wireless technology and lessons learned from the rollout of 5G. The 6G technology is almost certainly years away, but the administration’s effort is likely part of a bid to beat China and re-establish the US as a leader in wireless connectivity, as well as to carefully plan for new technologies that will be essential to national security and the broader economy. “It’s imperative that we start to look at these issues early,” a security official for the Biden administration said during a press call on Thursday evening. The White House wants to “take the lessons learned from 5G about the importance of early involvement and resilience,” the official said, and apply that to developing a 6G network that “optimizes performance, accessibility, and security.” Compared to 4G, the new 5G technology promised significantly enhanced performance in terms of speeds, reliability and zero lag time, opening the door to everything from new surgical procedures and safer transportation to more immersive video games. Although the 5G infrastructure rollout in the US is mostly complete — the final few carriers launched their 5G services in 2022 — consumer adoption still lags behind 4G in the country. ABI Research forecasts that by the end of 2023, more than 270 million subscribers will use 4G connectivity, compared to just over 170 million 5G subscribers. Some countries, including China, have found more traction. However, conditions in China are not directly comparable to those in the US, as the Chinese government has much more influence over business decisions, according to Leo Gergs, an analyst at ABI Research. The more limited 5G adoption in the US can also be attributed to the fact that 5G network infrastructure developed slower than expected, Gergs said. As a result, 5G networks are less potent and consumers may see less incentive to pay a premium for 5G connectivity. “For consumers the performance of 4G connectivity is good enough, so that they are less willing to pay an additional fee for the low latencies or faster data rates that 5G promises to consumers,” Gergs said. It’s unclear what 6G will look like. The administration said it expects that by combining elements such as AI, advanced software, cloud computing and cutting-edge semiconductor chips, it can create faster networks to support applications in health, energy, transportation, water and agriculture. But the government’s early focus on 6G also risks hyping that future technology and making it even harder for carriers to convince today’s consumers to pay to upgrade to existing 5G subscriptions, Gergs said. For the wireless industry, he said, it’s “a delicate situation.” ",454,tech,2023-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/tech/white-house-6g-plans/index.html

      Tucker Carlson out at Fox News
    ","Fox News and Tucker Carlson, the right-wing extremist who used his prime time perch at the talk network to exert a firm grip over the Republican Party, have severed ties, the network said in a stunning announcement that rocked the media and political worlds Monday. “We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,” Fox News said in a short statement that did not offer an explanation for his ouster, adding only that his last show was on Friday, April 21. Carlson, the highest-rated single host at Fox News, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The decision to part ways with Carlson was made Friday evening by Fox Corporation chief executive Lachlan Murdoch and Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, a person familiar with the matter said. Carlson was informed of the decision on Monday morning, a second person familiar with the matter said. The announcement came one week after Fox News settled a monster defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million over the network’s dissemination of election lies. The lawsuit had exposed Carlson disparaging colleagues. A lawsuit filed in March by his now-fired top booker, Abby Grossberg, also included a number of allegations of sexism on his show. During his time as a prime time host on Fox News, Carlson ascended to become one of the most influential figures inside the GOP. Republican lawmakers groveled at his feet and former President Donald Trump granted him the first interview earlier this month after his arraignment in New York. Carlson propelled himself to stardom in recent years by being a top promoter of conspiracy theories and radical rhetoric. Not only did he repeatedly sow doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 election, but he also promoted conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccines and elevated white nationalist talking points. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, praised Fox News’ decision, saying it is “about time” and that “for far too long,” Carlson has “used his primetime show to spew antisemitic, racist, xenophobic and anti-LGBTQ hate to millions.” Inside Fox News, some of Carlson’s internal critics rejoiced upon learning the news, people inside the network told CNN. There’s “a lot of relief generally, surprise they had the nerve to do it, and hope for a culture change,” one employee explained. It’s unlikely, however, that Fox News will stray too far from the right-wing talk that its loyal audience tunes in nightly for. The network said that, for now, Carlson’s 8 p.m. time slot will be filled by rotating hosts. Shares of Fox Corp. (FOXA) fell 5% on the news. The stock had been up slightly before the announcement. Carlson was a key figure in Dominion’s mammoth defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which the parties settled last week on the brink of trial for a historic $787 million. In some ways, Carlson played an outsized role in the litigation: Only one of the 20 allegedly defamatory Fox broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit came from Carlson’s top-rated show. But he was set to be one of Dominion’s first witnesses to testify at trial. And his private text messages, which became public as part of the suit, reverberated nationwide. Dominion got its hands on Carlson’s group chat with fellow Fox primetime stars Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and a trove of other messages from around the 2020 presidential election. These communications revealed that Carlson told confidants that he “passionately” hated former President Donald Trump and that Trump’s tenure in the White House was a “disaster.” He also used misogynistic terms to criticize pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and reject her conspiracies about the 2020 election – even as those wild theories got airtime on Fox News. Additionally, Carlson disparaged the right-wing network’s leaders in a series of text messages revealed in Dominion’s defamation case. In a text on Nov. 5, 2020 — two days after the 2020 election — Carlson wrote his producer Alex Pfeiffer: “We worked really hard to build what we have. Those f-ckers are destroying our credibility. It enrages me.” The pair appeared to be discussing the network’s coverage of the 2020 election, which had just recently — and correctly — called the critical state of Arizona for Joe Biden, enraging the network’s pro-Trump audience. Carlson later added on Nov. 6 to Pfeiffer: “A combination of incompetent liberals and top leadership with too much pride to back down is what’s happening.” Fox and other outlets projected that Biden would clinch the White House one day later. In a separate series of messages on Nov. 8, Carlson wrote: “Do the executives understand how much credibility and trust we’ve lost with our audience? We’re playing with fire, for real.” The lawsuit exposed how Carlson privately held a wholly different view than his on-air persona. A Dominion spokesperson did not comment on Carlson’s departure from Fox. In the two years since the attack on the US Capitol, the Fox primetime host used his huge platform to amplify paper-thin theories that the attack was a false-flag operation orchestrated by the FBI and government agents because they loathed Trump, and that the criminal rioters were themselves the victims. The baseless theory originated from a right-wing website, and Carlson catapulted it into the mainstream by repeatedly featuring it on his show. He routinely suggested that Capitol rioter and Trump supporter Ray Epps was actually an FBI provocateur who sparked the deadly riot. In a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday night, Epps had this to say about Carlson’s lies: “He’s obsessed with me. He’s going to any means possible to destroy my life and our lives.” An attorney for Epps sent a legal demand to Fox News in March demanding a retraction for “false and defamatory statements” made about his client. Carlson never apologized on-air. Carlson’s disinformation campaign about January 6 reached its apex just a few months ago, with an assist from the newly installed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican. The top-rated Fox host obtained and aired never-before-seen footage from Capitol security cameras, but the clips were cherry-picked and selectively edited. He said on his program that he ran the tapes by the US Capitol Police before airing the material, but they disputed his claim. Shares of Fox Corp.
            
                (FOXA) fell 5% on the news. The stock had been up slightly before the announcement. Grossberg, the ex-Fox News producer who has since disavowed the network, claimed in recent lawsuits that there was rampant sexism and misogyny among Tucker Carlson’s show team. Last month, she sued Fox News, Carlson, his executive producer Justin Wells and other figures, as well as Fox’s parent corporation. Grossberg, who joined Carlson’s team after the 2020 election, said in her lawsuit that after her first day on the job that “it became apparent how pervasive the misogyny and drive to embarrass and objectify women was among the male staff at TCT,” referring to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The lawsuits also claim that Grossberg alerted Wells to some of the “inappropriate and harassing conduct” that she endured while working at the show, but he “brushed aside” her concerns, according to court filings. Fox News is aggressively fighting two lawsuits from Grossberg. A Fox spokesperson previously said the lawsuits were “riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees.” In a lawsuit filed last month, Grossberg said Carlson “was very capable of using such disgusting language about women in the workplace.” She cited some of Carlson’s private texts to colleagues that were made public in the Dominion case, where he used the phrase “c-nt” to refer to Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, a top 2020 election denier. Her lawsuits also describe seeing sexually suggestive posters that were visible in the workplace, facing “uncomfortable sexual questions” from Wells about her former Fox News boss Maria Bartiromo, and witnessing internal debates on which women politicians were “more f–kable.” In a TV interview, she said the sexual harassment was so bad that she considered suicide. Wells was well-aware of the massive impact he and Carlson had on GOP politics, according to Grossberg’s lawsuit. She quoted a November 2022 editorial meeting where Wells allegedly said they had “the power to select the 2024 GOP presidential candidate” and a January meeting where he said Carlson planned to “save the Republican Party” by resolving the epic intraparty struggle over the House speakership. Carlson’s departure at Fox News comes after the network also severed ties with right-wing bomb thrower Dan Bongino, who had been a regular fixture on the network’s programming, in addition to hosting a weekend show. “Folks, regretfully, last week was my last show on Fox News on the Fox News Channel,” Bongino said on Rumble, chalking up the exit to a contract dispute. “So the show ending last week was tough. And I want you to know it’s not some big conspiracy. I promise you. There’s not, there’s no acrimony. This wasn’t some, like, WWE brawl that happened. We just couldn’t come to terms on an extension. And that’s really it.” Fox News responded in a statement, “We thank Dan for his contributions and wish him success in his future endeavors.” ",1526,media,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/media/tucker-carlson-fox-news/index.html

      Don Lemon and CNN part ways
    ","CNN has parted ways with longtime host Don Lemon. The announcement Monday came without explanation and astonished the media industry. “Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years,” said CNN CEO Chris Licht in a memo to staff. “We wish him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.” Lemon anchored “CNN This Morning” with Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins. The show has been on the air for nearly six months. “We are committed to its success,” Licht said of the morning show. In a statement of his own, Lemon said his agent told him Monday morning that CNN had terminated him. “I am stunned,” Lemon said, arguing that management did not have “the decency” to inform him of his firing directly. “At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network,” Lemon added CNN rebutted Lemon, calling his version of events “inaccurate.” “He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter,” the network said in a statement. Lemon joined CNN in September 2006. Prior to “CNN This Morning,” Lemon hosted the prime-time show “Don Lemon Tonight” for more than eight years. He gained significant fame during the presidency of Donald Trump for his no-holds-barred commentary about the former president, pushing back against his lies and calling him a “racist.” He was widely criticized for sexist comments he made on “CNN This Morning” in February. During an on-air discussion about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s proposal that older politicians take competency tests, Lemon argued that the 51-year-old Haley “isn’t in her prime.” Lemon said a woman is only “considered to be in their prime in 20s and 30s and maybe 40s.” Co-anchors Harlow and Collins pushed back, but Lemon doubled down on his point. Licht later sent a memo to CNN staff, calling the comments “unacceptable.” Licht said he had a “frank” conversation with Lemon, who apologized and was set to participate in formal training sessions “It is important to me that CNN balances accountability with … fostering a culture in which people can own, learn and grow from their mistakes,” Licht said at the time. “When I make a mistake, I own it,” Lemon told staff during an editorial meeting. “And I own this one as well.” Earlier this month, Variety published a report detailing allegations of misogyny aimed at female coworkers. Lemon denied the allegations. ",428,media,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/media/don-lemon-cnn/index.html

      NBCUniversal CEO stepping down over ‘inappropriate relationship’
    ","NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell is leaving the company after an outside investigation “into a complaint of inappropriate conduct,” its parent company Comcast announced Sunday. Shell will depart effective immediately in the wake of an investigation led by an outside counsel. “Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal. I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret,” Shell said in a statement. “I’m truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege.” The brief statement did not specify who the woman was or include any other details about the investigation. Comcast and NBCUniversal did not respond to requests for comment. The NBC staffer involved in the relationship filed a complaint in recent weeks, a person familiar with the matter said. Shell carried out his normal duties while the company engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation, the person added. There is no search underway for a successor to Shell, the person added. In the meantime, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh will assume Shell’s duties. Shell had been named CEO in January 2020 after leading content creation, programming and distribution for NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment. Shell had expressed confidence in NBC’s streaming service, Peacock, which surpassed 20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2022 and “nearly tripled” its revenue to $2.1 billion, according to its fourth quarter earnings report, which ended at the end of 2022. Its adjusted earnings loss, however, was wider. “There’s no question the whole television landscape is changing,” Shell said in an interview on CNBC “Squawk on the Street” last October. “If you have the right content, and you offer a broad distribution platform, your consumers are going to find you and that’s what we’re doing with Peacock.” Comcast is set to report its first quarter earnings on Thursday.

      Low employee engagement? Managers can help turn it around with this one habit
    ","Employers who want a productive, engaged workforce could do more to train, develop and support those in their managerial ranks. That’s because managers are the secret sauce. Gallup’s Quarterly Workforce Indicator surveys consistently show that managers are a linchpin to employee engagement, retention, productivity and trust in leadership. As it turns out, effective training for managers is not a thing at many workplaces. “I would say 99% of employers don’t provide effective training — and I’m not exaggerating there,” said Ashley Herd, a former human resources executive who founded @ManagerMethod. “While some provide training, rarely is it effective [in providing] the guidance needed to help managers understand how to meet business goals while supporting employees in the right way,” she said. One key thing managers need to know is how to communicate well. In fact, how managers speak with employees — and how often — can go a long way to building employees’ trust and commitment, according to Gallup. Managers who already feel stretched thin may not be psyched to hear this, but one of Gallup’s surveys — which included responses from more than 67,000 US workers — found that the most effective way to make someone feel connected to an organization is to have a “meaningful” conversation every week with each direct report to discuss goals, customers and well-being as well as offer recognition. The recommended time to allot for each conversation: 15 to 30 minutes. Sounds like a lot. But if you have, say, a team of 10 people, you’re talking about walling off no more than 2.5 hours a week. “We find this single habit develops high-performance relationships more than any other single leadership activity,” Gallup researchers noted. The workplace research firm’s surveys have found that the ratio of engaged to actively disengaged US workers is 1.8-to-1 today, down from a record high of 2.7-to-1 in 2019. The purpose of regular check-ins, researchers noted, is to have “strengths-based conversations that bring clarity and purpose to work — which is now deteriorating in US organizations.” Helping employees to feel connected is especially critical in a hybrid work environment, which done right can itself also boost employee engagement, Gallup found. In a separate study, Gallup has found that employees feeling free to speak truthfully about the effects of big changes at work is one key way to build trust in leaders. “When employees strongly agree that they have had opportunities to provide honest feedback about organizational changes, they are 7.4 times as likely to have confidence in their leaders to successfully manage emerging challenges,” Gallup research noted. Herd offered a few recommendations for what employers can do to improve their development of managers. For starters, she said: Survey managers: Find out what training they are receiving, what training they would like to see and what they do that works well for their teams.Survey employees: Find out what support they are getting from their managers, and what they would like to see.Appoint someone to lead trainings: Name an internal learning and development contact or someone from HR to gather information on best practices from those surveys. Have that person then lead an internal training for managers and another one for employees about how to work with their managers. Ask a handful of participants in each to talk about the best practices they’ve used — and have different leaders talk about their styles (e.g., extrovert or introvert), how they found their voice and how they work with different personalities on their teams.Set baseline requirements for communications with employees. One might be for managers to regularly meet with direct reports and not cancel on them except in a true emergency or when the manager is on PTO. Have managers share their meeting agendas ahead of time with employees. That way the manager and employee can add items if they wish. Encourage managers to listen. “[Remind them to] ask questions of employees, rather than just talk themselves,” Herd said.

      Today is Tax Day. Here’s what you need to know if you haven’t filed your return yet — and even if you have
    ","It’s April 18, the official deadline to file your federal and state income tax returns for 2022. (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.) Whether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic. “This is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters. For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season. The agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added. Those online tools may be especially helpful today if you are scrambling to get your return in before midnight. Or, if you’ve come to the realization that you need to file for an extension. Either way, here are some key things to know: Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you can’t pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have some payment plan options. But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions. If you’ve already filed your return, you’re probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about what’s ahead. What about my refund? If you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, it may be smaller than last year, even if your financial life didn’t change much. That’s because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired. So far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last year’s filing season. Will I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low. For filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million. Looking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited.

      Apple offers 4.15% high-yield savings to its Apple Card holders
    ","Apple on Monday announced that it is now offering its Apple Card holders a 4.15% high-yield savings account with Goldman Sachs. They may park both the 3% cash back they receive from using the Apple Card on select purchases plus other savings they may wish to deposit. The new product will provide a more holistic, financial-service experience under the Apple umbrella for its customers, who must use Apple hardware to benefit, noted Bankrate senior industry analyst Ted Rossman. For instance, you can only get an Apple Card if you use an Apple phone. “Savings helps our users get even more value out of their favorite Apple Card benefit — Daily Cash — while providing them with an easy way to save money every day,” Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, said in a statement. “Our goal is to build tools that help users lead healthier financial lives, and building Savings into Apple Card in Wallet enables them to spend, send, and save Daily Cash directly and seamlessly — all from one place.” The Apple savings account through Goldman is FDIC insured. Bankrate gives the Apple Card high marks as a no-fee rewards credit card, and the convenience of having a high-yield savings account for a cardholder’s cash rewards may be appealing. But the good news for Apple customers — or anyone else seeking more money on their savings — is that there are a lot of high-yield savings options on offer now that don’t require you to join the Apple club to benefit. Savings rates at the biggest banks — which are swimming in deposits — are still well below 1%. But there are plenty of deals to be had at FDIC-insured online banks. Rossman notes the 4.15% rate in Apple’s offer is the 11th highest on Bankrate’s list. No. 1 comes in at 5.02% at UFB Direct. And three other banks (No. 8-10) — LendingClub Bank, Rising Bank and Citizens Access, currently offer 4.25%. For any money you can afford to lock up for three months to a year you will get even higher rates by purchasing an FDIC-insured certificate of deposit. For instance, Rossman noted, the top-yielding 1-year CD now pays 5.2% — and that rate is locked in for 12 months. A high-yield savings account rate, by contrast — including Apple’s new offering — can move up or down without notice at any time.

      Even when women make as much as their husbands, they still do more at home
    ","Few women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure. “Even as financial contributions have become more equal in marriages, the way couples divide their time between paid work and home life remains unbalanced,” Pew noted. So who’s earning what? Pew found that in 29% of heterosexual marriages today, women and men earn about the same (roughly $60,000 each). “Husbands in egalitarian marriages spend about 3.5 hours more per week on leisure activities than wives do. Wives in these marriages spend roughly 2 hours more per week on caregiving than husbands do and about 2.5 hours more on housework,” the study notes. In 55% of opposite-sex marriages, men are the primary or sole breadwinners, earning a median of $96,000 to their wives’ $30,000. Meanwhile, in 16% of marriages the wives outearn their husbands as the primary (10%) or sole breadwinner (6%). In these marriages women earn a median of $88,000 to their husbands’ $35,000. Of all of these categories, the only one in which men are reported to spend more time caregiving than their wives is when the woman is the sole breadwinner. And the time spent per week on household chores in those marriages is split evenly between husbands and wives. In all instances, it’s a big change from 50 years ago — when, for instance, husbands were the primary breadwinner in 85% of marriages. Today, which women are most likely to be the primary or sole breadwinners can vary by age, family status, education and race. For instance, Pew found Black women are “significantly more likely” than other women to earn more than their husbands. For instance, 26% of Black women bring home more than their husbands, while only 17% of White women and 13% of Hispanic women do. But Black women with a college degree or higher and few children at home are also among the most likely to earn about the same as their husbands. These numbers are reported against a backdrop of society’s attitudes about who should earn more and how caregiving should be divvied up between spouses. Nearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew’s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them. What do women want? Twenty-two percent of Americans said most women want a husband who earns more, while 26% said most would want a man who earns about the same. Meanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. Only 19% said children are better off when their mother focuses more on home life and their father focuses more on his job. The Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census’ Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January.

Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

      How long should you support your adult children? Parents — and their kids — weigh in
    ","Parents invest so much of themselves, emotionally and financially, in raising their children — but the time comes when a parent has to stop subsidizing their adult children’s everyday expenses. Think housing, health insurance, car payments, cell phones, credit cards, subscription services, student loans and travel. And, as it turns out, kids and parents don’t agree on just when exactly that time should be. A new survey from Bankrate found that Gen Z adults (between the ages of 18 and 26) think parents should slow their roll on when to stop paying for them. Take housing. Gen Z adults said they shouldn’t have to start paying rent until age 23 on average. Baby Boomer and Gen X parents beg to differ, saying their kids should pony up starting at age 21. When it comes to cell phones and credit card bills, Gen Z thinks they should start paying for them by age 21. Their parents say age 19 would be better. The Bankrate survey doesn’t specify how many respondents are living with their parents or, conversely, their adult children. But it’s a fair bet the percentage could be significant. In July 2022, the Pew Research Center found that half of adults ages 18 to 29 were living with at least one parent. Of course, how a parent feels about the need for their child to pay their own bills and what a parent does may be two very different things. Nearly 7 in 10 parents with children 18 or older said they have made a financial sacrifice to help their grown-up kids, according to the survey. Thirty-one percent characterized that sacrifice as “significant,” while 37% said it was “somewhat significant.” Sacrifice meant: Reducing their emergency savings (51%), impairing their ability to pay off their own debt (49%) or save for retirement (43%); and making it hard to reach some other financial milestone (55%). Low-income parents — defined as those making $50,000 or less a year — were most likely to say they have made financial sacrifices to help their adult children. For instance, 58% of the lowest earners said they sacrificed their emergency savings compared to 46% of the highest earning households — defined as earning $100,000 or more a year. While it can be hard to say no to your adult offspring if they ask for, or simply expect, a financial assist, parents do themselves no favors if they subsidize them at the expense of their own financial security. After all, not everyone is likely to backstop a parent who falls behind on housing payments, fails to create a sufficient financial cushion for retirement or who finds they can’t afford medical care. “Make sure the assistance [you give] works within your budget and be clear about the parameters,” said Ted Rossman, a senior analyst at Bankrate. “Helping out shouldn’t be seen as a blank check or an indefinite handout. It might help to attach a specific dollar amount or time frame.” Bankrate’s survey, conducted from March 14 to March 16, included responses from a nationally representative sampling of 2,346 US adults, of whom 773 were parents with children age 18 or older.

      The latest on hybrid work: Who is WFH and who isn’t
    ","As the economy slows, are employers starting to regain the upper hand in negotiations with employees and job seekers? Pay is always an issue, of course, but in the wake of the pandemic, so too is how much time employers want people to work on site versus how much they are willing to let employees work remotely. Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that only 27.5% of private-sector businesses reported that their employees worked from home or another remote location some or all of the time between August 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022. In other words, 72.5% of private-sector organizations — up from 60% in the July-to-September 2021 period — said they did not have employees working remotely. That percentage struck work-from-home researchers and observers as surprisingly high, given what other studies and surveys have found. (More on those in a minute.) Private sector businesses employ a majority of US workers and, according to the Pew Research Center, 61% of workers do not have jobs that can be done remotely. But it’s worth noting that the BLS findings did not measure teleworking arrangements at federal, state and local government employers, at nonprofit organizations or among the self-employed. The BLS survey also interpreted respondents’ answers as referring to a company’s formal telework policies, not whether some employees informally work remotely on occasion, such as responding to work emails from home. “To the extent that ‘work from home’ would include an individual who checks their email after hours, we purposefully did not want to capture that type of informal work activity in the estimates as this would likely be included in the ‘rarely or never’ category,” a BLS spokesperson said in an email to CNN. Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom said he finds it hard to infer much from the BLS’s 72.5% finding, because he contends respondents must have misread the survey’s very first question, which said, “Do any employees at this location currently telework in any amount?” In his view, “any amount” includes answering work emails or taking a work call from home. Semantic concerns aside, however, the confusion and surprise over the BLS finding is a reminder that there is still no standard or easy way to measure the full extent of remote work in a post-pandemic world. Other surveys and studies of people who work for all employers — not just those in the private sector — suggest telework for those whose jobs can be done remotely remains common in this post-pandemic period. The Pew Research Center, for instance, found in a nationally representative survey of US full-time working adults conducted in February that 41% of workers with jobs that can be done from home are now working a hybrid schedule. That is up from 35% in January of last year. Among hybrid workers who are not self-employed, 63% said their employer requires them to come into the workplace with some regularity; 59% say they typically work from home three or more days a week. That suggests the push by top employers — such as Disney, Amazon, Apple, as well as several Wall Street banks — to get employees back into the office three or more days a week may not have moved the needle much. Meanwhile, Kastle Systems, which operates card-swipe security machines in office buildings across the United States, said that the weekly average office occupancy rate at the end of March in the most populous U.S. cities was 49% of pre-pandemic levels. While that’s much higher than the occupancy rates recorded during the height of the pandemic, it’s still a very long way from occupancy rates recorded back in February 2020 just before the pandemic hit. The latest results from the monthly Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA), which Bloom and other researchers have conducted since May 2020, found that the overall average number of paid days worked from home in 2023 so far is 1.4 per week (or 28% of the workweek). That’s based on responses from Americans aged 20 to 64 who earned $10,000 or more the prior year. The same survey respondents said their employers plan to allow employees to work remotely 2.2 days a week, for those who can. That’s up from the 1.6 days expected back in August 2020, although below the expected 2.4 days recorded in June 2022. SWAA found that working from home is most prevalent in cities and in sectors like technology and information, finance and insurance, and professional and business services. That is somewhat similar to the BLS finding that telework is most common in the following industries: information, professional and business services, educational services and wholesale trade. Remote work experts strongly assert hybrid schedules will remain a permanent feature of work in the United States for a host of reasons — including better worker engagement and retention — even if the parameters and kinks are still being worked out in real time. “Companies are still trying to figure it out,” said Sara Sutton, CEO of remote-work jobs platform FlexJobs, which she founded 16 years ago. But, Sutton added, “Hybrid is where things will settle.” When it comes to the overall average of how often employers are likely to let employees work from home, Bloom believes it will be 25% of the week. “I have talked to hundreds of organizations about WFH [working from home] over the past three weeks, and this is now clearly stabilizing to a post-pandemic norm,” he said in an email. Fully remote jobs, meanwhile, will remain but may become less prevalent than they have been of late. In Pew’s February survey, 35% of people who could work remotely were doing so full time, down from 55% in October 2020, but still well above the 7% of people working remotely full-time before the pandemic.

      Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time
    ","For most people in their early- to mid-20s, filing taxes is right up there with having to pay rent and realizing you can’t take summers off anymore: an unwelcome fact of being an adult. If you’re a recent graduate working your first full-time job or supporting yourself for the first time, this tax-filing season may indeed be your first experience doing your own taxes without the help of a parent. So here are seven things to keep in mind. If you’re confounded by filing your taxes, you may think it’s because you’re young and inexperienced. Nonsense. Tax filers of all ages get confused by tax rules and the intricacies of all the tax documents required. And it doesn’t help that tax provisions are tweaked frequently. Your tax return is a financial snapshot of your life over a 12-month period, in this case 2022. And a lot can happen during that time that will have tax implications and need to be reported. “Think about what went on in your life in the past year,” said Tom O’Saben, the director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Preparers. For example, O’Saben asked, did you work more than one job? Did you move for a new job? Did you get laid off? Did you get married or have a child? Did you make student loan payments? Did you make money selling anything you own? Did you buy a home? Next, pull together all necessary documentation. In addition to receipts and other paperwork you may have kept, you should also have tax forms that were either mailed to you or sent electronically — from your employers, brokerage firms, college, loan servicers, the state unemployment office, etc. You’ll need the information on these forms to fill out your tax return accurately. Keep in mind, the IRS also has a copy of these “third-party” forms that were sent to you, so its systems will flag if there is any discrepancy between what is on the form sent to you and what you put on your return. Most people realize what they earn at a full-time job is subject to income tax and that those taxes are automatically withheld by your employer. But any side hustle income you generate, or money you make as a gig worker, is also taxable, even if you’re paid in cash or via a payment app. Ditto for tips. And often tax on that type of income is not withheld. You’re just paid a gross amount and will have to set aside money to cover the taxes owed on it. Severance payments and unemployment benefits may be taxable too. And so is investment income — meaning the profits (or “capital gain”) you make on the sale of an investment or property — which is basically the price for which you sell something minus the original price you paid for it. (Also worth noting: if you have investment income, also called “passive” income, it is taxed at a lower rate than your paycheck — i.e., “earned” income — assuming you held your investment longer than a year.) Most dividends and interest payments are also taxable. And remember all that lucrative fun you had betting on the SuperBowl or spending a weekend with friends in Vegas? Yup, your winnings from gambling and sports betting are considered taxable income. (The semi-good news is if you had any gambling losses last year, they can offset your wins, so it may be that you won’t owe tax on your winnings if your losses cancel them out.) For many of these types of income you should have received forms from your employer (a W2 if you’re a full-time employee); from your clients if you’re a contract or gig worker (eg. a 1099-K, a 1099-NEC) or, starting next year, from the payment apps on which you get paid for your goods and services (e.g., a 1099-MISC). Meanwhile, banks and brokerage firms will send you 1099-INTs (for interest), 1099-DIVs (for dividends) and 1099-Bs (for your capital gains and losses). If you live in Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington or Wyoming, you don’t have to file a state tax return because those states don’t impose an income tax. If you live in New Hampshire and Tennessee, you won’t have to file a return for your salary and wages. But you may have to file a return if you got income from dividends and interest during the tax year. The standard deduction reduces your adjusted gross income. The amount for tax year 2022 is $12,950 for singles; $25,900 for married couples filing jointly; and $19,400 for heads of household (e.g., a single parent). “That’s the amount of money you don’t have to pay tax on,” O’Saben noted. The only filers who itemize their deductions are those whose deductions add up to more than the standard deduction. Itemized deductions include: charitable contributions, state and local income and property taxes, mortgage interest and casualty loss if you live in a federally declared disaster area. But even if you just take the standard deduction you may also take in addition what are called “above-the-line” deductions. These include up to $2,500 in student loan interest that you paid in 2022 (your student loan servicer should send you a Form 1098-E); any contributions you made to a deductible IRA or to a Health Savings Account; and, if you’re a teacher, up to $300 of what you spent on school supplies and personal protective equipment for your classroom. [For a fuller list of different types of taxable income (“additional income”) and above-the-line deductions (“adjustments to income”), see Schedule 1 to the federal 1040 form.] A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax bill and if it’s a “refundable” credit, which some are, it can actually increase your refund. Some credits to be aware of, especially if you’re not making a lot of income: The Earned Income Tax Credit: The EITC is intended to help low- and moderate-income workers (defined in 2022 as those with earned income under $59,187), and especially filers with children. The EITC is also available to earners without qualifying children and it’s worth $560 for 2022. Education credits: If you were in school last year, footed the costs and are not claimed as a dependent on anyone else’s tax return, you may be eligible for an American Opportunity Tax Credit or a Lifetime Learning Credit. To see if you qualify, here’s an IRS table comparing the eligibility requirements and the value of each of those credits. Also, check to see if your educational institution sent you a Form 1098-T, which you will need if you claim one of these credits. The Saver’s Credit: The Saver’s Credit is a federal match for lower-income earners’ retirement contributions for up to $2,000 a year. The Child Tax Credit: If you’re a parent you may claim a maximum child tax credit of $2,000 for each child through age 16 if your modified adjusted gross income is below $200,000 ($400,000 if filing jointly). Above those levels, the child tax credit starts to get reduced. And the portion of the credit treated as refundable — meaning it is paid to you even if you don’t owe any federal income tax — is capped at $1,500, and that is only available to those with earned income of at least $2,500. And if you paid for child care in 2022, you may be eligible to claim a dependent care credit. Your federal tax return is due on April 18. That is the day by which you must have filed your 2022 individual tax return and paid any remaining federal income taxes owed for last year. The only exceptions are for those who lived in federally declared disaster areas, in which case their deadlines are later. But anyone can apply for — and will automatically be granted — a six-month extension until October 16, 2023 to file their return if they submit Form 4868 by April 18. Note, though, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay if you still owe the IRS more in taxes for last year than you actually paid in 2022. So, unless you have good reason to believe you will receive a refund, get a ballpark estimate of what more you think you’ll owe the IRS and send in that check by April 18 if you file for an extension. Otherwise you could be hit with a late payment penalty. And that could be compounded by a failure-to-file penalty if you didn’t file on time or didn’t get an automatic filing extension.

      Paul Rudd films emotional moment between Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney after Wrexham secures promotion
    ","When the referee blew the full-time whistle confirming Wrexham’s promotion from the National League for the first time in 15 years, the club’s Hollywood owners could scarcely believe it. Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, who had promised to transform the club after their takeover in 2021, looked temporarily winded and almost sunk to their knees as thousands of fans celebrated inside the Racecourse Ground. It was an emotional moment captured by fellow Hollywood stalwart Paul Rudd, who filmed the pair in the immediate aftermath of Saturday’s 3-1 win over Boreham Wood. After a moment to themselves, Reynolds and McElhenney then shared a long hug before the latter appeared to wipe away tears from his eyes. The pair then turned to celebrate with the sea of fans who had run onto the pitch. “Rob and I kinda blacked out during this moment, but somehow we’ll never forget it,” Reynolds wrote on Twitter, sharing the video taken by Rudd. It was an emotional moment that the team’s supporters had been longing for and, such is the way at Wrexham these days, they were joined in celebration by a long list of famous faces. ‘Ant-Man’ star Rudd has been one of many Hollywood A-listers to visit Wrexham in recent months and the 54-year-old appeared to enjoy his time in Wales. Footage and photographs on social media showed Rudd drinking in the local pub and meeting excited Wrexham fans ahead of Saturday’s match. Many other celebrities took to social media to congratulate Wrexham after its promotion into the Football League. Oscar-winning Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins replied to a tweet from Reynolds branding him an “honorary Welsh boyo,” while former England player Gary Lineker congratulated the club on its achievement. “I fancy the next series might be a decent watch,” Lineker tweeted, in reference to the ‘Welcome to Wrexham’ TV series released last year which documented the club’s fortunes since the takeover. As well as acting royalty, the Prince of Wales also tweeted after Wrexham secured promotion. “A club with such amazing history, looking forward to a very exciting future back in the Football League. Doing Wales proud,” Prince William wrote. While the club’s new high profile fans sprinkle a touch of stardust to proceedings, Saturday’s win was for the lifelong fans who have endured a difficult ride of late. ]The historic small town club, which was once in the higher echelons of English football, had been on the brink of extinction in 2011 and had struggled to compete on the pitch. But since the takeover, the club has been transformed and will play in League Two next season, the fourth-tier of English football. Three further promotions and Wrexham would be in the English Premier League. Such a notion may appear farfetched, but the surreal has become all too normal for Wrexham supporters of late. “I think we can hear how it feels to the town and that’s what’s most important for us – I think this is a moment of catharsis for them,” co-owner McElhenney told reporters after Saturday’s game. “For us to be welcomed into their community and to be welcomed into this experience has been the moment of my life.” ",528,football,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/football/wrexham-promotion-paul-rudd-hollywood-reaction-spt-intl/index.html

      Barcelona scrapes by Atlético Madrid 1-0 to remain in firm control of La Liga title race
    ","FC Barcelona scraped by Atlético Madrid 1-0 at the Camp Nou to extend its lead at the top of La Liga over eternal rival Real Madrid to 11 points. Ferrán Torres’ goal in the 44th minute made the difference, ensuring Atlético continued its 17-year winless drought – with 8 draws and 15 losses – at the Camp Nou. While the Blaugrana were still missing Ousmane Dembélé, Sergi Roberto and Andreas Christensen, the return of Frenkie de Jong from a hamstring strain strengthened Barça manager Xavi’s squad ahead of what was expected to be a stern test on a warm, sunny afternoon in northeastern Spain. After his team’s 0-0 draw with Getafe in Madrid, Xavi said his team played poorly because it was “accustomed to playing without sun.” After being derided on social media throughout the week, the Barça legend doubled down on Friday ahead of the match, saying, “Even if they make a bunch of memes about me, the sun bothers me … I’m not going to stop (complaining).” The sunny conditions did indeed seem to be getting the better of Barça as Atlético bolted right out of the gate with Antoine Griezmann hitting the crossbar with an effort not even a minute into the match, but the ball was just centimeters too high to bounce into Marc-André ter Stegen’s net. Barça’s first real threat of the match came in the 24th minute as Robert Lewandowski played the ball through to Torres, whose dangerous cross was fortuitously deflected by Atleti keeper Jan Oblak out of the danger zone. In the 35th minute, the Colchoneros again seemed to be gaining control of the match as the ball dropped to Griezmann whose great shot on the half-turn was brilliantly saved by ter Stegen to keep the scoreline level. Just when Barça’s domination of possession in the first half seemed to be fruitless, the first goal materialized near the stroke of half-time. Raphinha passed the ball back into the middle of the pitch to an unmarked Torres at the top of the area, who took his time before finishing past Oblak to score Barcelona’s first goal in 334 minutes since its 4-0 victory over Elche on April 1. But Atlético didn’t back down and pushed for an equalizer after the half-time break; Yannick Carrasco had his curving shot, which was heading towards goal, tipped over the bar in the 54th minute. Barcelona seemed to turn its game up another notch when star midfielder Pedri made his long-awaited return from injury in the 60th minute, giving the Blaugrana a more fluid and creative attack. Raphinha missed a sitter in the 72nd minute after Lewandowski teed him up with a brilliant cross, which almost came to haunt Barcelona as Ter Stegen was forced to make another brilliant save just one minute later to deny Griezmann’s back heel effort off a good Álvaro Morata cross into the box. READ: Vinícius Jr. is being racially abused during LaLiga matches. Why is nobody being punished? Atlético players clamored for a penalty in the 91st minute after a headed ball was deflected off Sergio Busquets’ arm in the area, but the video assistant referee refused to review the play. A flurry of Barça fouls allowed several Atleti attacks in the final minutes of time added on, but the Colchoneros couldn’t make the most of the opportunities. Oblak told reporters after the match that the wasted chances left the team ruing an otherwise a solid performance. “The feelings we get aren’t the best. In the first half, we didn’t play badly, we were pretty good and they scored one in the last minute,” Oblak said. “In the second half, there were chances, but the feeling we have aren’t the best. We lost and we can’t say much more than that.” “The team worked really hard, the crowd supported us and we won,” goalscorer Torres told reporters after the match. “The win gives us a lot of confidence. Atlético was on a good run of form and it’s important for us to have won this match.” The win means Barcelona remains in firm control in the La Liga title race with eight matches remaining and an 11-point lead ahead of Real Madrid. After the match, Pedri told reporters that Barça has “eight finals left” and that the Blaugrana “have to go match by match,” with Xavi adding that it was an important win towards securing the title against a strong team. “We normally don’t concede very much, but Atlético is on an extraordinary run of form lately and that shows you the state of our team. It’s a crucial victory for us,” the manager said. ",774,football,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/football/barcelona-atletico-madrid-la-liga-spt-intl/index.html

      Newcastle hammers Premier League top 4 rival Tottenham Hotspur 6-1 with five goals in opening 21 minutes
    ","St James’ Park was delirious with joy after just 21 minutes, barely believing its eyes as Newcastle United took a 5-0 lead against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, eventually cruising to a 6-1 victory against its top four rival. It was difficult to imagine a worse start for Spurs. In fact, there had only been one worse in the entire history of the Premier League, when Manchester City scored five goals in 19 minutes against Watford in September 2019, according to the statistics website OptaJoe. But that year, City finished second and Watford were relegated. Newcastle against Spurs was supposed to be an evenly poised game, a showdown between fourth and fifth place, separated by just three points, and with a place in next season’s Champions League on the line. Far from being evenly matched, it seemed as if Newcastle was playing in a different league in that opening 20 minutes as Tottenham manager Cristian Stellini’s experiment of playing with a back four backfired. With their victory, the Magpies move up to third in the league, now with a six-point buffer and a game in hand over Spurs, and they take a big step towards their first qualification in the Champions League for two decades. “It’s not often you have a start like that in a game, especially one of such importance,” Newcastle manager Eddie Howe told BBC Sport. “I’m delighted with the whole group, a real team effort.” The floodgates opened at the first instance of pressure, barely a minute in when Joelinton drifted into the box, rifled the ball towards the net, and Lloris’ parry fell at Joe Murphy’s feet who made no mistake with the finish. Every attack seemed to yield a corner, an opportunity, a shot on goal and Newcastle continued to press while Tottenham’s defense continued to buckle. Less than five minutes later, Fabian Schär hoofed the ball upfield from the halfway line and found Joelinton in space who beat Lloris with a brilliant finish. Stunned, Tottenham began backing off the ball and Murphy capitalized when Spurs lost possession deep in their own half, firing the ball into the goal past Lloris for a third goal in less than 10 minutes. “I wasn’t surprised, I was just happy to see it go in, when I struck it I knew it was a clean strike,” Murphy told Sky Sports. “It means everything, I always want to add value whether I’m starting or coming off on the bench, everyone wants to do it.” Ten minutes later, a single pass once again unlocked Tottenham’s defense, this time Joe Willock found Alexander Isak with a floated pass from the halfway line and the Swede found the back of the net. And then, barely two minutes after kickoff, there was another for Isak who made it five goals for the Tyneside club in 21 minutes. Harry Kane pulled one back for Spurs after halftime, a glorious solo effort as he danced down the wing and found the back of the net with effortless ease. But it was no matter, as Callum Wilson restored Newcastle’s five-goal advantage midway through the second half with his team’s sixth. The result leaves Tottenham teetering on the brink of missing out on European football next season as the club sits within striking distance of Aston Villa, Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League table. “It’s very embarrassing,” Lloris told Sky Sports afterwards. “We should apologize to the fans. We didn’t show a good face and we could not match the performance of the Newcastle players.” ",592,football,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/football/newcastle-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html

On a raucous evening at the Racecourse, and with Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney – the actors who have transformed the club since their 2021 takeover – in the stadium, Wrexham secured promotion to the Football League after a 15-year absence. “I’m not sure I can actually process what happened tonight, I’m still a little speechless,” Reynolds told reporters after the game. “One thing that’s running through my head over and over again was at the beginning, people said ‘Why Wrexham, why Wrexham’; this is exactly why Wrexham, what’s happening right now, is why.” Once the referee blew his whistle, a come-from-behind 3-1 win against promotion-chasing Boreham Wood secured, thousands of fans raced onto the pitch, the victorious players disappearing in the red mist as fans lit flares, waved banners, and lost themselves in the moment. Television cameras showed McElhenney shedding a tear. “I think we can hear how it feels to the town and that’s what’s most important for us – I think this is a moment of catharsis for them,” McElhenney said. “For us to be welcomed into their community and to be welcomed into this experience has been the moment of my life.” It will be said that this was a tale made in Hollywood, but the truth is the story was always here, waiting for Hollywood. The historic small town club saved from the brink by its fans, once in the higher echelons of the English football league system only to tumble into the National League, its fortunes taking a downturn both on and off the pitch. But then came Reynolds and McElhenney and Hollywood did what it does best, adding stardust and hope to create a magical conclusion to what is the end of a chapter, not the story. Wrexham will next season compete in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league. Three further promotions and they will be in English Premier League; easy to write, much harder to achieve. Hours before kick-off, the sound of tooting horns and singing fans could be heard near the stadium. The atmosphere building for a kickoff which had been moved to later in the day so it could be broadcast live on TV. There was no mistaking the significance of the occasion: win and the championship would be Wrexham’s and a first promotion since it was relegated to the National League in April 2008. But the team had been here before, and failed. There was optimism – this team has only lost three times this campaign and dropped just two points at home – but also some uncertainty. Seeds of doubt are hard to rid after years of near misses. Fans descended to the city in numbers, hotels were booked up for the night, pubs were overflowing, and there were film stars in attendance too, as is often the case these days. Accompanying Reynolds and McElhenney for this promotion-clinching match was Paul Rudd, star of Marvel’s “Ant-Man.” He had been pictured in the Turf, a pub near the ground, before the match, the latest Hollywood star to visit the bar which regularly features in “Welcome to Wrexham” – the TV documentary which follows the actors’ first season in charge. Lifelong fans will often shake their heads in disbelief when asked about the impact the owners and their show have had on the club and the city. That this Welsh city is now recognized globally is a source of amusement and bemusement. The documentary seems to have captured the imaginations of many, with Americans especially seemingly having fallen for a club which is the beating heart of its community. New Wrexham fans, from Ohio, Los Angeles, Washington and Arizona, had come to Wales this week; some had tickets, some just wanted to be in the city to see for themselves what they had watched on TV. The club’s worldwide appeal can be measured in merchandise sales, 80% of which this season has been in global sales, the club says. By December, the club had sold out of shirts – 24,000 home, away and third strips snapped up. It is unprecedented. Needless to say, a bigger order has been put in for next season. What next for Wrexham? The competition in League Two will be tougher, but arguably the aim – promotion to League One – might be an easier challenge than the one the club faced this season as three teams are automatically promoted from League Two, instead of the one automatic promotion spot on offer in the National League. In Phil Parkinson, in charge of the team since the summer of 2021, the club already has a seasoned manager, one who has now enjoyed four promotions in his career, as well as several players already accustomed to playing in the Football League. “It’s a massive moment for this football club – from the owners all the way down to the supporters who have followed this club over the last 15 years in some really tough times, and I’m pleased for every single one of them,” Parkinson said. Paul Mullin, the star striker who has been integral to the team’s resurgence and who McElhenney called “one of the greatest football players in the world,” will likely be a key player next season too. He scored twice, the first a special curling effort which put the home team 2-1 ahead and a 71st-minute strike which all but secured the win sparked wild celebrations. “All the shenanigans that comes with playing for Wrexham – to deal with it the way we have and obviously to come back from one down tonight is unbelievable and we love what we’ve done,” he said. “The fans deserved this – I think after the first minute, they were all fearing the worst but you know, we stick together… no matter what’s been thrown at us.” The records broken this season – with a game remaining the club has already broken the record for most goals and points in National League history – suggests Wrexham will be more than capable of being competitive next season. When Reynolds and McElhenney took ownership of the club in February 2021 few could have imagined the impact the pair would make. The story, and the dream, continues.

      Is there a La Liga title race? Real Madrid eases past Celta de Vigo 2-0 to put pressure on Barcelona
    ","Real Madrid eased past Celta de Vigo 2-0 on Saturday in what was a relatively calm and assured performance for Los Blancos to cut Barcelona’s lead atop La Liga to eight points ahead of Atlético Madrid’s visit to the Camp Nou on Sunday. Goals from Marco Asensio and Éder Militão sealed the win in the first of Real’s run of three La Liga games before the Copa del Rey final against Osasuna on May 6 and the first leg of the Champions League semifinals against Manchester City on May 9. Boasting a few lineup changes following their win against Chelsea in the Champions League quarterfinals – Madrid trotted out Asensio, Dani Ceballos, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Antonio Rüdiger and Nacho from kick-off – the Merengues dominated possession throughout, but couldn’t find the target throughout much of the first half. Celta never really threatened in the first half and the deadlock was broken in the 42nd minute when Ceballos made a brilliant through pass down the left side to Vinícius Jr. who made a single touch into the box before crossing the ball to an incoming Asensio, who thumped the ball with his left foot past Celta keeper Iván Villar. The 1-0 marked Asensio’s 11th goal of the season in all competitions and Vinícius’ 17th assist across all competitions. Real kept the pace up after half-time, looking for the two-goal cushion that would allow it to lift its foot off the pedal – and it wouldn’t have to wait long. In the 48th minute, Asensio took a great corner into the area, where an on-rushing Militão powered a header into the bottom left corner for his fifth league goal of the season past a helpless Villar. Madrid could have added to the tally, with Vinícius proving a constant danger on the left side with his speed and passing into threatening areas, but failed to convert several chances. It wasn’t until the 77th minute that Celta provided any danger to Thibaut Courtois and the Madrid defense; Celta midfielder Oscar threaded the ball past Rüdiger and Nacho in the Madrid backline to Iago Aspas, who used his strength to keep Nacho at bay and force a magnificent 1-on-1 save from Courtois. The Madrid keeper has proven with his performances over the last two years that he is one of the best goalkeepers, if not players, in the world, and he was caught reprimanding his defense following another dangerous Celta attack just one minute on from the Aspas save. But there was to be no cheering from the Celta fans in attendance with only the choruses of madridistas celebrating and chanting the names of several players on the night, including Nacho, Ceballos and Luka Modrić – who subbed on in the 81st minute to help steady the wheel for the remaining minutes of the contest. “I think the atmosphere around us helps out a lot, it helps us to give 100% – and even more sometimes. Because of that, I think all the players appreciate and thank this fan base, which always shows us love,” Real boss Carlo Ancelotti said after the match. Madrid faces Girona next in La Liga on Tuesday at the Estadi Montilivi. ",530,football,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/football/real-madrid-eases-past-celta-vigo-spt-intl/index.html

      Manchester City cruises into FA Cup final with 3-0 victory over Sheffield United
    ","Manchester City’s treble hopes remain alive after defeating Sheffield United 3-0 in the FA Cup semifinal, thanks to a hattrick from Riyad Mahrez. It was always the likely result although the knockout stages of any competition can produce surprises and Pep Guardiola had rested five key players – Kevin De Bruyne, Rúben Dias, Rodri, John Stones and Ederson – ahead of Wednesday’s likely title-deciding Premier League clash against Arsenal. Still, City is one of the best teams in Europe while Sheffield United is fighting for promotion in England’s second tier – the Championship – but it was not an entirely one-sided game. “Excellent performance,” Guardiola told ITV afterwards, “we cannot forget three days ago we were in Munich. “The quality of Riyad we have seen for many years in this country, also with Leicester. (He is a) huge mentality competitor. Huge ambition to score goals. Scoring at the end of the first half was so important.” Sheffield kept the scores pegged at 0-0 for much of the first half and had its own chance to take the lead early on when Iliman Ndiaye’s attempt after a corner was saved by Stefan Ortega. But City won a penalty in the 43rd minute, which Mahrez converted and from there, the outcome seemed clear. Just after halftime, Mahrez scored his second goal of the game – a glorious strike after he won possession on the halfway line, wove his way past the Sheffield defense and fired the ball into the net. And then five minutes later, he had a hattrick – the first in an FA Cup semifinal since 1958 – latching onto Jack Grealish’s cross and making no mistake with the finish. “It feels very good (to score a hat-trick),” Mahrez told ITV afterwards. “The most important thing is that two or three seasons in a row we’ve come here in the semi-finals and lost. Today, we wanted to make sure we got to the final. I think I had a good game. “I don’t know really which goal was the best. It’s a good team achievement and we took the game seriously.” City will face either Manchester United or Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup final on June 3.

      Barcelona takes 1-0 lead over Chelsea in Women’s Champions League semifinal in front of a record-breaking crowd
    ","Barcelona took a step forward to reaching the Women’s Champions League final by defeating Chelsea 1-0 in the first leg of their semifinal clash. In front of 27,697 fans at Stamford Bridge – a record crowd for a women’s Champions League game in the UK – Barcelona took the lead in the fourth minute thanks to Caroline Graham Hansen’s brilliant goal and never relinquished it. “I think we did an amazing job,” Jonatan Giráldez said afterwards, according to UEFA. “Of course we knew that it was a difficult game. “We stopped them many times in the game. We had patience with the ball, had a lot of chances – maybe we could have scored more goals but in the end we got a victory and everything is open for the second leg.” Graham Hansen opened the scoring early in the first half, going on a mazy run before finding the back of the net with a sensational long-range effort. “It was just one of these moments you get the ball, everything fits when you go for it and you know it’s going to be a goal,” she said afterwards, according to UEFA website. But the Blues regrouped after conceding the early goal, engineering chances for Guto Reiten and Sam Kerr, and banishing any thoughts of a similar collapse against Barcelona in the 2021 Champions League final when it lost 4-0. “I can’t ask any more of the players,” Chelsea manager Emma Hayes told the club website afterwards. “I think they gave their maximum. I remember that we lost the Champions League (final in 2021) after 25 minutes so I think it’s important for us to remember it’s half time and we’re 1-0 down that it’s important for us to learn and improve and get ready for our away leg.” Barcelona continued to press in the second half but suffered a setback midway through when defender Lucy Bronze exited with a knee injury, though Giráldez later confirmed that it wasn’t serious. “It was something in her knee, but now she is fine,” he said. “In the moment we made the substitution because it looked bad, but in this moment the feeling is really good.” The second leg will be played at Camp Nou on April 27.

      Arsenal wobbling in Premier League title race ahead of probable deciding clash against Manchester City
    ","Arsenal was cruising three weeks ago, one hand on its first Premier League trophy for 19 years, albeit with one eye on an impressive Manchester City, then eight points behind in the title race with a game in hand. But pressure can do strange things, and the Gunners now face the daunting prospect of traveling to the Etihad Stadium to face City on Wednesday in an effective title-decider after three improbable draws, dropping six points and finding themselves just five points ahead of City which now has two games in hand. First, there was the trip to Anfield where Arsenal dominated Liverpool in every facet of the game for 40 minutes and opened up a 2-0 lead with ease, before somehow Liverpool pulled a goal back, then equalized in the 87th minute and almost scored a winner in injury time. But, for all its problems this season, Liverpool is still “a very, very difficult team to dominate for 90 minutes … a really good team,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said in his press conference afterwards, and Anfield is still Anfield. It seemed like it might be a blip, simultaneously a dropped two points and salvaged one point, that injected drama into a title race still balanced on a knife-edge between Arsenal and City. Then, the following weekend, the exact same scenario played out but this time against 14th placed West Ham, just three points above the relegation zone, and compounded by a missed penalty from Bukayo Saka. And on Friday, Arsenal suffered a third consecutive draw against bottom placed Southampton at home, although this time it was the one salvaging a draw from defeat. Southampton raced into a 2-0 lead after less than 15 minutes, and it took two late goals from Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka in the 88th and 90th minute to rescue a 3-3 draw. “At the end it’s tough because you can see (the players) on the floor and you have to leave them,” Arteta said in his press conference afterwards. “I think everybody has to disconnect tonight, digest it and tomorrow start to think what is the best way to go to Manchester to beat them.” The Gunners will face a seasoned City this week, one accustomed to winning Premier League titles and still seeking a treble this season with Champions League semifinal against Real Madrid and a FA Cup semifinal against Sheffield United coming up. “Manchester City have two games in hand but if we want to be champions we have to go there to win the game – that is all,” forward Gabriel Jesus told Sky Sports after the Southampton result. And as the season approaches its climax, City is in sparkling form, following 10 consecutive victories and a draw in the second leg of its Champions League quarterfinal against Bayern Munich, helped by a record-breaking Erling Haaland seemingly finding the goal at every opportunity. At Arsenal, meanwhile, Arteta has built a title challenge out of a young but talented squad around academy graduate Saka and Brazilian youngster Gabriel Martinelli, integrating summer signings Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko, whose experience winning titles at City will likely prove crucial. “Whether the point makes that much difference to Arsenal, I’m not quite sure,” former Liverpool player and now pundit Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports. “They’ve probably got to go to Man City and get three points if they want to go on and win the league. They did have a really sizeable lead, but they are going to have to do something miraculous now between now and the end of the season.” ",597,football,2023-04-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/football/arsenal-premier-league-title-race-southampton-spt-intl/index.html

      Iga Świątek returns from injury layoff and defeats Zheng Qinwen at Porsche Tennis Grand Prix
    ","World No. 1 Iga Świątek enjoyed a winning return from injury as she defeated China’s Zheng Qinwen 6-1 6-4 at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany. The Polish star had been away from the tour for more than a month after sustaining a rib injury at Indian Wells in California and needed less than an hour and a half to sweep past Zheng on Thursday. Świątek, who is defending her title in Stuttgart in preparation for the French Open next month, broke Zheng’s serve four times over the course of the match. Having cruised through the opening set, she was tested in the second but secured a crucial break to go 5-4 up before holding serve to wrap up the victory. “I’m pretty happy that I’m not rusty and I could perform good tennis, even though I had a break,” Świątek said after the win. She will next face Karolína Plíšková in the quarterfinals, the Czech former world No. 1 having defeated Croatia’s Donna Vekić 6-2 6-7 7-6 on Thursday. Świątek will be looking to win her third French Open title and fourth grand slam overall when the tournament gets underway in Paris on May 28. She was forced to withdraw from the Miami Open and Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers in recent weeks but announced before competing in Stuttgart that she is now injury free. “I felt like I needed to be 100% focused from the beginning to the end … I’m just really happy that I can play here again and enjoy the whole atmosphere,” Świątek said on Thursday.

      Rafael Nadal’s French Open participation in doubt as he struggles to recover from injury
    ","Rafael Nadal admits he doesn’t know if he will recover from injury in time to defend his title at the French Open. The 22-time grand slam champion said in a video posted on social media that his recovery process is taking longer than anticipated, forcing him to pull out of tournaments in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and now Madrid, which gets underway on April 25. Nadal suffered a hip injury during his second-round Australian Open defeat to Mackenzie McDonald and said he initially hoped to be fit again within six to eight weeks, but he has now had to change his treatment plan as his recovery enters its 14th week. The 36-year-old admitted it had been a “difficult few weeks and months.” “The reality is that the situation is not what we would have expected,” Nadal said. “All medical suggestions have been followed, but the progress has not been what they initially told us. “We find ourselves in a difficult situation. The weeks are passing and I had the dream of being able to play in tournaments that are the most important in my career such as Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Roland Garros. “I was training, but a few days ago we decided to change course a bit, do another treatment and see if things improve to try to get to what comes next. I can’t give deadlines because, if I knew, I would tell you, but I don’t know. This is how things are now.” The greatest clay court player of all time, Nadal has enjoyed unparalleled success at Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid, holding the record for most titles won at all three events. The French Open, where Nadal has won the title an unprecedented 14 times, begins on May 28. “I have no choice but to try to have the right attitude throughout this time, try to give myself the opportunity to compete in one of the tournaments that remains of the clay season and I have no choice but to work and have the right mentality,” Nadal added.

      Emma Raducanu beaten in less than an hour by Jelena Ostapenko in Stuttgart
    ","Britain’s Emma Raducanu suffered another agonizing defeat, after being knocked out in the first round of the Stuttgart Open on Tuesday. Jelena Ostapenko took less than an hour to thrash Raducanu 6-2, 6-1 in straight sets at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. “It’s never easy playing Emma,” the Latvian, the 2017 French Open champion, told reporters. “But I was so fearless out on court today, and was focused from the first to the last minute. Things can continue the same way,” she added. Ostapenko, ranked No. 22 in the world, remained unbroken throughout the match, and converted all five of her break points. “I knew against her the main thing was to step in the court,” the 25-year-old Ostapenko said. “Of course, I missed some balls but I tried to be aggressive all the time when it was possible. Just try to take the ball early, don’t give her many chances. And finally, I’m back on clay, my favorite surface.” The 20-year-old Raducanu, who won the US Open in 2021, has been plagued by injuries over the past 18 months that have dampened her hopes of on-court success. Raducanu suffered an ankle injury before the Australian Open earlier this year, while tonsillitis forced her to withdraw from the Austin Open in February. Meanwhile, a recurring wrist injury, which hampered her last season, came back to bite during the Miami Open, where she exited in the first round. Former British tennis player Laura Robson noted earlier this month that Raducanu had looked “really good” ahead of the clay court season. “Emma’s level is there for sure,” Robson told Eurosport. “She hits the ball just as well as any of the top players on tour. “But it’s just finding the right balance on the training side of things, on the match court and tournament schedule side of things to make it work for the body because everyone is different, everyone requires different amount of matches as well. “I think if she’s just able to get another couple of consistent weeks under her belt, then the belief will come and you start to trust your body a bit more and you start to then not worry about some small injuries because it’s just part of being a tennis player,” added Robson, who is a former Junior Wimbledon champion and an Olympic silver medalist.

      Novak Djokovic suffers shock loss to Lorenzo Musetti at Monte Carlo Masters
    ","Novak Djokovic suffered a shock defeat in the Monte Carlo Masters round-of-16 Thurday with the Serb falling to a 4-6 7-5 6-4 loss at the hands of Italian 21-year-old Lorenzo Musetti. Djokovic, 35, looked out of sorts from the start of the rain-affected clay court tie and world No.21 Musetti went on to break his serve eight times during the two-hour and 54-minute match. The Serb uncharacteristically allowed Musetti to trade breaks with him throughout the opening set, before eventually seizing control. The 22-time Grand Slam winner then took a 4-2 lead in the second set, and it looked like the game was going the way many had expected with the No. 1 ranked player in charge. However, Musetti had other ideas and battled his way back into the game to level the tie. In the deciding set, the Italian broke his opponent’s serve before going on to convert his fourth match point to seal the upset. Speaking on court after the game, Musetti tried to contain his emotions, saying: “I am struggling not to cry.” The victor continued: “It is an emotional win because it was a really long match … I am really proud of myself. I am struggling not to cry because it is a dream for me.” Djokovic told reporters he was “not really in the mood to speak” and felt “terrible” following his loss. The shock defeat will be a cause for concern for two-time Monte Carlo Masters champion Djokovic as this is one of his key events in his preparation for the French Open. Musetti will now play fellow Italian youngster Jannik Sinner in the next round. Like Musetti, Sinner also had to win from behind to secure his place in the quarterfinal.

      WTA set to return to China in September despite uncertainty over Peng Shuai’s situation
    ","The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) announced Thursday that it will return to hosting tournaments in China in the fall after suspending all events in the country in 2021 due to the uncertainty over tennis player Peng Shuai’s safety. “After 16 months of suspended tennis competition in China and sustained efforts at achieving our original requests, the situation has shown no sign of changing,” the WTA said in a statement. “We have concluded we will never fully secure those goals, and it will be our players and tournaments who ultimately will be paying an extraordinary price for their sacrifices. For these reasons, the WTA is lifting its suspension of the operation of tournaments in the People’s Republic of China.” Peng was feared to be held incommunicado by the Chinese government after she accused retired Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her into sex during a years-long on-and-off relationship. “While we do not regret our decision on the suspension, the WTA and its members feel that now is the time to return to our mission in China. We are hopeful that by returning more progress can be made,” the WTA said. “Peng cannot be forgotten through this process. “It is important that our renewed engagement in China provides continued safety for Peng and all the women athletes who will benefit from our return to competition and the opportunities tennis provides. It is essential that women’s voices must be heard when speaking out. The WTA will continue to advocate for Peng and the advancement of women around the world.” Peng last appeared in February 2022 when she met Olympic officials at the Beijing Winter Games and then was interviewed by independent French sport news site L’Equipe. The WTA did not disclose the tour’s schedule in China. Last year, the tour said the 2023’s season-ending WTA Finals will be held in in Shenzhen, China. Human Rights Watch called the WTA’s decision to return to China a “huge disappointment,” but “not surprising.” “International businesses need to work together to do the right thing,” said Yaqiu Wang, senior China Researcher at Human Rights Watch. “It’s hard to challenge the Chinese government alone, but if businesses band together to address China’s flouting of human rights, the power balance can shift. “After all, sports organizations and companies all want to operate in an environment where the human rights of their players, employees, and consumers are protected and there is rule of law. It’s important to keep Peng Shuai’s case in the public eye. “What she did initially was extraordinary. It gave the world a glimpse into the corruption and abuses at the very top of the Chinese government. For it, she is still paying a price. Even given the outcome, what she did and what the WTA did initially was not in vain. “The IOC, which governs the WTA, has adopted a human rights framework in the aftermath of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, and all sports federations have a responsibility to do human rights due diligence for their operations in China and beyond. “The road to expose the Chinese government’s human rights abuses and hold it accountable is difficult and often incurs a cost, and it’s not a straight road.” ",532,tennis,2023-04-13,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/tennis/peng-shuai-wta-china-return-spt-intl/index.html

      World No. 1 Iga Świątek says tennis missed opportunity in not banning Russian, Belarusian players
    ","Tennis missed an opportunity to send a strong message to Moscow by failing to impose a blanket ban on players from Russia and its ally Belarus after the invasion of Ukraine, world number one Iga Świątek said. Wimbledon banned players from the two countries last year after the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special military operation,” but said in March that it would now accept them as neutral athletes. The 2022 tournament was the first time players were excluded on grounds of nationality since the immediate post-World War Two era, when German and Japanese players were banned from the championships. “After World War Two, German players were not allowed as well as Japanese and Italian (players), and I feel like this kind of thing would show the Russian government that maybe its not worth it,” Poland’s Świątek told the BBC on Wednesday. “We are just athletes, a little piece in the world, but sport is pretty important and sport has always been used for propaganda … Tennis, from the beginning, could do a bit better in showing everybody that tennis players are against the war. “Tennis didn’t really go that way, but now it would be pretty unfair for Russian and Belarusian players to do that because this decision was supposed to be made a year ago.” Russian and Belarusian players have been competing on the tours and at the other grand slams as neutral athletes. Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka, who won this year’s Australian Open, has said she struggled to understand the “hate” in the locker room. Świątek described the locker room atmosphere as “pretty tense.” “It’s not their fault they have a passport like that … their situation is pretty complicated and it’s hard for them to speak out loud about it,” the 21-year-old said. “On the other hand, we all have some kind of impact and anything that would help stop the Russian aggression, we should go that way in terms of the decisions the federations are making.” ",330,tennis,2023-04-06,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/06/tennis/iga-swiatek-russia-belarus-tennis-wimbledon-spt-intl/index.html

      Wimbledon to allow Russian and Belarusian players to compete this year
    ","Wimbledon will accept entries from Russian and Belarusian players for this year’s tournament if they agree to compete as neutral athletes and comply with “appropriate conditions,” organizers announced Friday in a statement. Tennis players from Russia and Belarus were banned from playing in last year’s championships following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, resulting in the men’s and women’s professional tours – the ATP and WTA – and the International Tennis Federation (ITF) stripping Wimbledon of its ranking points. Entry conditions for this year’s event, one of tennis’ four majors, include prohibiting “expressions of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” while players who receive funding from the Russian or Belarusian state will not be allowed to compete, including those receiving sponsorship from companies operated or controlled by them. “We continue to condemn totally Russia’s illegal invasion and our wholehearted support remains with the people of Ukraine,” Ian Hewitt, chairman of the All England Club, said in a statement. “This was an incredibly difficult decision, not taken lightly or without a great deal of consideration for those who will be impacted. “It is our view that, considering all factors, these are the most appropriate arrangements for The Championships for this year. We are thankful for the Government’s support as we and our fellow tennis stakeholder bodies have navigated this complex matter and agreed on conditions we believe are workable. “If circumstances change materially between now and the commencement of The Championships, we will consider and respond accordingly.” The All England Club said the entry conditions had been “carefully developed” through conversations with the UK government, the Lawn Tennis Association – Britain’s national governing tennis body – and international stakeholders. It added that the decision has the “full support” of the UK government, the LTA, ATP, WTA and ITF. “The ITF’s position on this issue has been clear and consistent from the start and remains the same,” the ITF, world tennis’ governing body, said in a statement. “We acted swiftly to suspend the Russian Tennis Federation and Belarus Tennis Federation from ITF membership and from participation in ITF international competitions until further notice. “At the time we recognised that there would be specific responses from nations, and this is what we saw with the LTA and All England Lawn Tennis Club last year. Their collective position has now evolved, and we continue to work closely with them on this issue. “Tennis stands in solidarity with Ukraine.” In a joint statement released Friday, the WTA and ATP said it is “pleased that all players will have an opportunity to compete at Wimbledon and LTA events this summer.” “It has taken a collaborative effort across the sport to arrive at a workable solution which protects the fairness of the game,” the statement added. “This remains an extremely difficult situation and we would like to thank Wimbledon and the LTA for their efforts in reaching this outcome, while reiterating our unequivocal condemnation of Russia’s war on Ukraine.” Wimbledon takes place this year from July 3 to July 16.

      Boris Becker says best to ‘make friends with the strong boys’ as he recalls ‘very scary’ life in prison
    ","Tennis great Boris Becker says he’s grateful just to be alive as he reflected on spending time in prison in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. Becker was released from Huntercombe prison in December after serving just eight months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence for charges relating to his 2017 bankruptcy case. Soon after his release, Becker told German broadcaster Sat 1 that a prison “inmate tried to kill” him during his incarceration. “It feels great [to be out],” Becker told Amanpour. “You only appreciate freedom once you’ve been incarcerated, let me tell you. It’s a different lifestyle, it’s a different world. I’ve been out now for over three months and I’m happy to be here alive and speaking to you. “Prison life is a very dangerous place. I watched a couple of movies beforehand just to prepare myself a little bit, but I didn’t expect it like that. It’s very scary. It’s a real punishment. I mean, prison’s supposed to be that, but it’s a real punishment taking away your freedom, your livelihood. “The only currency you have is your character and your personality – literally – and you better make friends with the strong boys because you need protection, you need a group of people that look out for you.” A six-time grand slam champion, the 55-year-old was speaking to Amanpour ahead of the release of a new documentary about his life and career, titled ‘Boom! Boom! The World vs. Boris Becker.’ The two-part documentary, which airs on April 7 on Apple TV, is the work of Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and Oscar-winning producer John Battsek, who had special access to Becker for more than three years until his sentencing in April 2022. “I was originally intrigued by doing a doc about Boris because I was a huge tennis fan, of course, and Boris is one of the great players of all time,” Gibney told Amanpour. “So when John Battsek approached me and said: ‘Would you be interested in doing this?’ I told him: ‘You had me at Boris.’ “But the other thing that was interesting to me, I’d seen Boris play a cameo role in a film called ‘Love Means Zero’ and it’s rare when you get an athlete of Boris’ stature who can talk as eloquently as Boris can about the sport, and also about the psychological elements of tennis. “So it was Boris’s skill as a player, but also as a storyteller that really intrigued me to do the story.” The documentary reflects on Becker’s meteoric rise to stardom after winning Wimbledon at the age of just 17 and his high-profile personal life. Becker went on to win 49 titles, including six grand slams and Olympic gold, during an illustrious career, before becoming a tennis broadcaster and coach – notably to Novak Djokovic – once his playing career was over. Gibney explains he was intrigued by the prospect of telling the story of Becker’s rise and fall as well as what he calls the German legend’s redemption arc. “We began to explore a little bit more deeply some of the circumstances that led Boris into prison and we did a long interview with Boris just three days before he was sentenced, when he didn’t know what exactly was going to happen to him,” says Gibney. “It was at that moment that he was reckoning very honestly with his life, in a way that’s quite powerful in the film, but the glimpse at the very end of the story is of a redemption story. “That is to say he made some mistakes, he’s paid for them and now there’s an opportunity for Boris to write a new chapter.” Becker reflects on his life in the same way he does a tennis match, using his victories from two sets down as a metaphor for where he currently finds himself. In tennis, as in life, thing were “never easy” and “always a bit of a struggle,” Becker recalls. “But the most important point is the last point, not the first, and my plan is to win my last point,” he says. “That’s the red line in all my professional life and private life; yes, I go through trials and tribulations, sometimes for the right or wrong reasons, but I never give up. When Alex talked about the next chapter, I’m building my third chapter, probably my last one, as we speak. “Yeah, I should have done this and I should have done that, but in hindsight you’re always smarter. I’ve done what I’ve done, I’ve paid my dues and I’m ready for a comeback.” Becker says he had “enough time of reflection” while in prison, thinking about the mistakes he’d made but any sense of “feeling sorry for yourself” didn’t last long as “you have to get up the next day and literally survive.” Becker calls prison life a daily “fight for survival.” The 55-year-old also recalled some good memories while he was incarcerated, his four-set comeback win over Andre Agassi in the 1995 Wimbledon semifinal a particular game he thought about “once or twice.” “If prison doesn’t humble you, I don’t know what will,” Becker says. “When you literally lose everything and you go into a really small cell for 231 days, if that doesn’t humble you then you’re lost anyway. “I’ve had time to not forget where I’m coming from, but it wasn’t always bad. I’ve got some good things, I’ve got some victories, I’ve met good people along the way. Especially the last couple of years when you do struggle, when you are really lost, the amount of people that are with you are leaving by the minute. “Just a handful of people stayed and because of them, I never lost hope. They’re part of my new team that s trying to help me come back.” ",970,tennis,2023-03-29,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/tennis/boris-becker-alex-gibney-documentary-spt-intl/index.html

      Chevron Championship: Lilia Vu channels memory of late Grandfather to clinch first major title
    ","Lilia Vu triumphed at the Chevron Championship on Sunday, besting American compatriot Angel Yin in a playoff to seal the first major of her career in The Woodlands, Texas. Vu had begun the final round four shots adrift of co-leader Yin but rallied with five birdies – including two to close – to tie the world No. 172 at 10-under and force a playoff. On the first replay of the 18th hole, the 25-year-old curled home a winding birdie putt to clinch victory after Yin’s second shot had splashed into the water. Shortly after, it was Vu’s turn to find the water. Leaping into Poppie’s Pond had been a long-running tradition for champions at Mission Hills in California, host of the major from its inception until its relocation to Carlton Woods for 2023. Vu wasted no time in renewing the ritual, diving into the lake beside the 18th green to toast her second LPGA Tour victory and a winner’s check of $765,000, the largest of her career. Having almost walked away from the sport following early struggles as a pro, it crowned a cathartic victory for the world No. 12. “Everything happens for a reason,” Vu told reporters. “All the bad things, everything I’ve ever struggled through, family-wise, internally, I think myself as the biggest obstacle, I had a pretty tough, not easy past two days. “I was definitely my own enemy, and I don’t know how I pulled this out. I’m just really happy and proud of Cole [caddie] and I for doing this.” Despite a decorated amateur career, Vu endured a grueling start to life on the LPGA Tour, making the cut just once in her first nine starts after turning professional in early 2019. She would not play another LPGA event until 2022, by which point she had lost a formative figure in her life. Vu’s grandfather, who had fled his native Vietnam with her mother, had died in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Amid bubbling frustrations during a wet and windy final round, it was the memory of her grandfather that kept Vu grounded. “I was just in such a bad place with my golf game. Everything was life or death,” Vu said. “I just saw everybody that I’ve competed with being successful, and I just compared myself all the time. “But now I know that everybody’s journey is different, and everything happens for a reason … Even today, I was getting really upset on the course, and I just had to remind me, like, ‘Grandpa is with you, and he’d be really disappointed if you were getting upset like this and that you didn’t get your act together.’ “I think he’d say that all my struggles were worth it,” she added. Runner-up Yin was upbeat despite agonizingly missing out on a first career major. The 24-year-old, runner-up at the US Open in 2019, had looked poised for victory before back-to-back birdies at the 16th and 17th holes opened the door for Vu. A pressure birdie at the final hole to force the playoff signaled a strong response, but Yin’s fightback was ultimately sunk by her subsequent shot into the water. “I didn’t really feel much nerves at all this week, even coming into this stretch,” Yin told reporters. “My caddie was telling me to calm down, but other than that, I really just wasn’t really feeling much. I’m just really mellow. That’s why this lack of emotion, and I’m not crying. “I’m just really happy with who I am, where I am and what I’m doing right now … If I can talk about how much I appreciate life right now, I’ll get emotional, not over this,” she added. World No. 2 Nelly Korda finished one stroke short of making the playoff in third, with Thailand’s Atthaya Thitikul headlining the group of five players that finished tied for fourth at eight-under par. Meanwhile, Jennifer Kupcho endured a grim attempt to defend her title, shooting six-over par to miss the cut and finish tied for 108th. The women’s golf major calendar continues with the US Open at Pebble Beach in California on June 6.

      Tiger Woods undergoes ‘successful’ surgery following Masters withdrawal
    ","Tiger Woods has completed “successful” surgery on his ankle following his withdrawal from The Masters earlier this month, the 47-year-old announced Wednesday. The 15-time major winner made the cut at Augusta National despite admitting to “constant” pain, only to pull out of the major before the resumption of the rain-delayed third round. Visibly struggling to walk during a grim start to his round, Woods later explained that the withdrawal was due to a reaggravation of his plantar fasciitis, a tissue inflammation that causes pain on the bottom of the foot. The surgery, performed at HSS Sports Medicine Institute in New York City, was deemed to be “successful” by Dr Martin O’Malley, according to a post from Woods’ Twitter account. “Earlier today, Tiger Woods underwent a subtalar fusion procedure to address post-traumatic arthritis from his previous talus fracture,” the statement said. “Tiger is currently recovering and looks forward to beginning his rehabilitation.” The statement did not specify a timeline for Woods’ recovery process or return to competitive action. The next major on the calendar, the PGA Championship at Oak Hill in New York, looms on May 18. The golf icon’s competitive appearances have been sporadic since suffering severe leg injuries in a serious car crash in 2021, with Woods prioritizing taking part at the majors. His 25th appearance at The Masters marked just his second competitive event of the year, and in 2022, his PGA Tour outings were limited to The Masters, The PGA Championship and The Open Championship. Woods’ withdrawal at Augusta sparked further questions about his future in game, with Woods himself unsure as to how many Masters appearances he had left in him. Sky Sports analyst Butch Harmon said he had hoped Woods wouldn’t make the cut at the tournament, given the “agony” he saw the golf legend enduring while navigating the hilly Augusta terrain. “If you look where The Open is this year [Royal Liverpool], it’s fairly flat … US Open in LA – yes, the LA Country Club’s got some hills and stuff,” Harmon added. “The difficulty here [Augusta National] is the walk, it’s just such a tough walk for everybody and so I think it had to happen for his sake. Will we see him again? Gosh, I hope so.” ",375,golf,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/golf/tiger-woods-surgery-masters-withdrawal-spt-intl/index.html

      ‘We know what’s at stake’: Matt Fitzpatrick playing to win his brother a PGA Tour spot at Zurich Classic
    ","In 2013, a 14-year-old Alex Fitzpatrick caddied his older brother Matt to victory at the US Amateur Championship in Brookline, a win that secured the champion an exemption for the following year’s US Open. The rest is history: Matt Fizpatrick would return to the same site in 2022 to clinch the major, announcing his arrival as England’s premier golfing talent. Now, the world No. 8 has the chance to return a favor to his younger sibling. On Thursday, the Fitzpatrick brothers will pair for the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, a PGA Tour event that will see 80 two-player teams battle it out at TPC Louisiana for a split of the $2,398,000 winner’s purse. The triumphant pair on Sunday will also receive a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour. Though not a motivation for the field’s elite names like Fitzpatrick, for his 24-year-old younger brother – ranked 705th in the world and forging his path on the Challenge Tour – it could be life-changing. “That would be incredible for him, there’s no doubt about that,” Fitzpatrick told CNN Sport’s Don Riddell. “We know what’s at stake and we know what possibilities there are if he does well and, hopefully, we can do that.” A few months after Fitzpatrick’s dramatic US Open triumph, he found himself pitted in the same field as his younger sibling at the Italian Open in Rome. After the second round, the junior Fitzpatrick led the major champion in average driving distance by 0.36 yards – a slender gap, yes, but enough to warrant a jab via text. The reply – shared via Fitzpatrick’s Instagram – showed a screenshot of the US Open winner’s name atop the leaderboard, with his brother’s tied-18th position included for good measure. Yet beneath the cheap shots, it’s all brotherly love, and the pair gel well on the course despite contrasting styles. “Our games are pretty opposite,” the elder Fitzpatrick said. “I’m a good driver, he’s a good iron player. He’s a good short game and I’m a good putter. “He wants to do as well as he can, of course he does, but for me his path is probably going to be a little bit different than mine. The golf world is very different from when I started to when he’s playing now so he’s going to focus on the Challenge Tour probably, he’s excited for that. “Hopefully, he can follow in my footsteps.” They will be some tough footsteps to follow. Triumph at the RBC Heritage on Sunday, sealed with a dramatic playoff win over three-time major champion Jordan Spieth, penned the latest glorious chapter in what has been an outstanding few years for Fitzpatrick. The fact that the victory came at Hilton Head, a long-time holiday destination for the family from Sheffield, made it even more special, as the 28-year-old realized a childhood dream of lifting silverware on the Harbour Town course. “Moments like that, you wish time travel was real and you could go back and say, ‘This is what’s going happen in a few years,’” he said. “I would have been amazed, it was always one that I wanted to win and it was very special to do it.” And as if winning couldn’t have been any sweeter, it arrived in the face of overwhelmingly one-sided crowd support for home hero Spieth, with ‘U-S-A’ chants soundtracking much of the deciding playoff holes. Spieth gestured to fans for quiet, but Fitzpatrick relished his leading role as a villain. “It was great … I definitely enjoyed being in it,” he said. “I wouldn’t say I’ve played in that atmosphere too often, but it’s certainly nice to perform under that pressure and I think that’s what made it mean so much as well.” Fitzpatrick is looking forward to a role reversal of crowd bias when Italy hosts the Ryder Cup for the first time in September. Rome’s Marco Simone Golf and Country Club will be the stage for what Team Europe hopes will be a decisive rebound after a bruising defeat at the hands of their American rivals at Whistling Straits in 2021. Fitzpatrick, a member of that team and the similarly defeated 2016 roster, is yet to win a singles match at the biennial tournament but would touch down in Rome a far more accomplished player should he be selected. “I’d really like to be one of the top players that week and play really well,” he said. “I’m just excited for that opportunity and I think that’s what’s really important is to first make the team, and then look forward to it, enjoy it, and go out there and try to win some points for Europe.” His other main aim for 2023 is to add another major to his trophy cabinet, no easy feat with the caliber of names chasing the same goal. A tied-10th finish at The Masters signaled a strong start to the major season for the Englishman, who finished eight strokes adrift of dominant winner Jon Rahm. The Spaniard’s second major title consolidated his reputation alongside Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy in the so-called ‘big-three’ atop the rankings. Yet Fitzpatrick – dubbed the hardest-working golfer on the PGA Tour – has no intention of accepting his place in the food chain. “I don’t wanna just sit back and be like, ‘They’re all too good for me and I’m just happy with where I am.’ That’s not me as a person,” Fitzpatrick said. “I’m constantly looking at ways to improve and get better, and that’s what’s really important is to keep pushing myself and try and catch them up.” ",933,golf,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/golf/matt-fitzpatrick-brother-zurich-classic-spt-intl/index.html

      How to watch the Chevron Championship live: Start time, channel and other things to know
    ","Once again, the first women’s golf major of the season tees off with The Chevron Championship. Yet on Thursday, that tee is moving some 1,580 miles from its Californian desert roots. After a 51-year stay at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, the LPGA Tour’s opening major is taking up new residence at Carlton Woods in The Woodlands, Texas, under a sponsorship deal with energy company Chevron. The Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course – personally designed by ‘The Golden Bear’ – will play host to a stellar 132-player field boasting 29 major winners, including defending champion Jennifer Kupcho and world No. 1 Lydia Ko. US viewers can watch the first and second rounds on the Golf Channel, with coverage running from 10 a.m. CST until 7 p.m. CST. The Golf Channel will then show live coverage of the weekend’s final two rounds from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m CST before the action moves over to NBC from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. CST. In the UK, Sky Sports Golf will broadcast the opening two rounds live from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. BST and 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. BST before coverage switches to Sky Sports Mix for the Saturday and Sunday rounds from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. BST. A move to The Lone Star State marks merely the latest – albeit the most substantial – development to a tournament that has seen plenty of change over the years. Founded in 1972 as the Colgate-Dinah Shore Winner’s Circle – a nod to co-founding actress and singer Dinah Shore – the event wasn’t upgraded to major status until 1983. Since retitled The Nabisco Championship, The Kraft Nabisco Championship and the ANA Inspiration, Chevron’s deal with the tournament was announced in 2021, ushering in a new name, a new location and an increased prize purse of over $5 million. In waving goodbye to Mission Hills, the event also said farewell to one of its most famous traditions – the Poppie’s Pond leap, a trend started by Amy Alcott in 1988. Almost 34 years to the day, Kupcho became the final ‘Lady of the Lake’ with her dive into the waters beside the 18th green after her maiden major triumph in 2022. However, a lake along the boundaries of the par-five 18th green at Carlton Woods offers Sunday’s champion the opportunity to regenerate the tradition. World No. 20 Kupcho will face stiff competition in her bid to retain her crown. All of the world’s top-20 ranked players will headline a glittering field who have accumulated 41 major wins and 247 titles between them, according to tournament organizers. A two-stroke advantage over US compatriot Jessica Korda sealed an impressive victory for Kupcho at last year’s event, having shared the lead from the close of the first round. The victory lifted Kupcho, who had arrived as the world No. 53, from a grueling rut of form. The 25-year-old returns to defend her title in a more comfortable place. “I think I was in a bit of a panic last year,” Kupcho told reporters Tuesday. “I was struggling hitting the ball, so I had a little bit of a panic, calling my swing coach … trying to figure out what was going wrong with my swing and hitting the ball. “I would say I’m a little bit more relaxed this year. Feel like I have my feet under me and ready to go.” New Zealand’s Ko arrives as the player to beat, with three wins in her last eight starts consolidating her place at the summit as she seeks to end a seven-year wait for a third major after victory at Mission Hills in 2016. Victory would come with the added bonus of ushering the 25-year-old into the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame, with Ko just two points – or one major win – shy of meeting the point threshold for entry. “It would be pretty cool to get it done in the first major of the year and be in the Hall of Fame, but that’s not what’s important to me,” Ko told reporters. “I just want to have a good week and put myself in position, and if I have a chance at it and be the one that’s holding the trophy at the end of the week, that’s pretty awesome. But I don’t think that’s going to be my driving force going to any of these events this year.” A win for world No. 2 Nelly Korda, who missed last year’s event due to a blood clot in her arm, would see the 24-year-old American add to the maiden major title she won at the 2021 Women’s PGA Championship. Should she win, Korda has promised to take the plunge into the waters at the 18th green, a tradition she is glad to continue despite the change of scenery. “I think Chevron and everyone involved in the tournament is doing an amazing job to kind of keep the traditions alive,” she told reporters. “Obviously, changing locations is different for sure, but … if you win, you still get to jump … and you still get to hoist the trophy, so at the end of the day, that’s what matters. They’re stepping in and supporting women’s golf, and I think that’s the big picture that everyone should focus on is that they stepped up and they’re the ones that are supporting us.” World No. 10 Georgia Hall, England’s highest ranked player, touches down in Texas in imperious form. With two runner-up finishes in her last three starts, the 2018 British Open champion hasn’t placed outside the top-15 in any 2023 event. “I don’t think I have a weakness in my game at all, and I think that’s partially why I’ve been very consistent,” Hall told reporters. “I think my mentality is the strongest part of my game, and that’s the key to why I play well. It’s just a combination of the last year or two of hard work and stepping it up another level. “Now, it’s just coming all together very nicely, and I’m glad the hard work is paying off.” ",1019,golf,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/golf/chevron-championship-watch-time-preview-spt-intl/index.html

      Matt Fitzpatrick beats Jordan Spieth in playoff to win RBC Heritage
    ","Matt Fitzpatrick conquered reigning champion Jordan Spieth in a playoff to seal an emotional RBC Heritage victory at Hilton Head on Sunday. With the duo unable to be separated at 17-under par after an enthralling final day battle, the Englishman broke the deadlock in stunning fashion on the third playoff hole, punching his approach shot to within inches of the cup before tapping home for birdie to clinch his second PGA Tour title. His first had come after a similarly close-fought final round at the US Open in Brookline last year. There had been a late scare then when his last tee shot found the bunker, and the 28-year-old’s heart rate will have been just as high when both of Spieth’s putts for birdie across the first two playoff holes looked destined to settle in the cup. Yet once again, Fitzpatrick endured, weathering the storm to become only the second Englishman to win the tournament after Nick Faldo in 1984. Victory jumps him to a career-high world No. 8 and seals him $3.6 million in prize money from a $20 million purse, elevated by the tournament’s status as a designated event on the PGA Tour. It also marks a win at a course with a special significance to Fitzpatrick. Though born and bred in Sheffield, family holidays spent at Hilton Head Island meant a win at Harbor Town Golf Links was a bucket list item for the Englishman. “I think I can retire now,” Fitzpatrick joked to reporters. “This one is the one that I’ve always wanted to win. [Of] any golf tournament – other than the majors, of course – there isn’t a higher one on my list than to win this one, and that’s the truth. “My family can tell you that, and my friends can tell you the same thing. This place is just a special place for me, and it means the world to have won it.” Having taken a one-shot lead into the final round, Fitzpatrick exchanged the lead multiple times with Spieth, seeking to defend his title after a playoff victory over Patrick Cantlay a year ago. Cantlay again impressed but came up narrowly short, finishing one stroke adrift of the score needed to join the leading duo in the playoff. Spieth was roared on by the South Carolina crowd as he and Fitzpatrick replayed the 17th and 18th holes, with chants of ‘U-S-A’ audible at multiple points during the playoff. The Dallas-born world No. 9 could be seen gesturing to fans for quiet, but Fitzpatrick was unfazed, a magnificent approach leaving his American rival needing to make a birdie from close to 40 feet at the 18th to prolong the contest. “When you’re the underdog or the person that everyone is not rooting for, it’s obviously a little bit sweeter when you do win, there’s no doubt about that,” Fitzpatrick said. “Obviously the U-S-A and the Spieth chants were louder, but I definitely had support out here, and I felt that because of my connection here.” Spieth’s effort rolled wide to compound another agonizing runner-up finish, his 18th on the PGA Tour since his first year as a pro in 2013 and four more than any other player during the same period, according to the PGA Tour. The two-time major champion had looked set to become a 14-time PGA Tour winner on both the first two playoff holes, only for his first birdie putt to lip out and his second to pull up inches short. Spieth, who arrived in South Carolina off the back of an impressive tied-fourth showing at The Masters last week, had lifted his putter in celebration as his first effort had rolled towards the hole. His disbelief remained even after Fitzpatrick’s victory was sealed. “I think if I hit the same putt 10 times, it goes in eight times. It should go left at the very end there on the grain. It just wasn’t meant to be,” Spieth told reporters. “Someone was going to make a birdie. It wasn’t going to be a bogey to lose that playoff the way that we were both playing today … He [Fitzpatrick] just snuck in and played some tremendous golf.” ",698,golf,2023-04-17,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/golf/matt-fitzpatrick-rbc-heritage-jordan-spieth-spt-intl/index.html

      Golf Digest launches a new amateur tournament
    ","The Masters is over for another year but there is another tournament to look forward to on the horizon. Golf Digest is launching a new national, two-person team best-ball tournament allowing amateur golfers to compete for a $1,000 cash prize as well as inclusion in an upcoming issue of the magazine. The Golf Digest Open will consist of eight regional qualifiers contested by 400 teams over the summer before 32 teams will advance to a two-day national championship on October 30 and 31st. “We’ve just launched and we’ve already seen registrations. We think we’re going to sell out real fast,” Joshua Stern, Golf Digest’s Vice-President of Business Operations and Marketing Partnerships, told CNN’s Don Riddell. The top two teams from each qualifier in both the Gross and Net divisions will play in the national championship, held at the brand new OMNI PGA Frisco Resort in Texas, which is set to host a number of prestigious events, including the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship in 2025 and the men’s PGA Championship in 2027. There, the teams with the lowest cumulative 36-hole score in each division will be crowned champions. “It’s going to feel very competitive because we’re doing gross and net divisions so the opportunity for a golfer of any skill to participate and actually win their local qualifying tournament and get into the national championship will be high,” Stern said. Timed to coincide with golf’s expansion after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Golf Digest Open “could become the new national amateur tournament,” Stern added. The entry fee for the qualifiers is $500 per player, covering greens fees, cart fees, practice range access, breakfast and/or lunch, and a gift, while entry for the National Championship costs $1,000 per player including green fees, two-nights accommodation at the resort and meals for the duration of the national championship. The tournament begins on June 12 at The Standard Club in Atlanta, a Golf Digest Best in State course, and the Mesa Country Club, which was designed by the man who built the famed Torrey Pines Golf Course. Among the other courses hosting events are Kemper Lakes Golf Club, host of the 1989 PGA Championship, and Aviara Golf Club in California, which hosts the annual LPGA Tour event.

      Jon Rahm cruises to 2023 Masters victory, sealing Spaniard’s second career major
    ","Jon Rahm won the 2023 Masters on Sunday, clinching his first green jacket and second career major with an unflappable showing at Augusta National. The Spaniard put on a clinic in consistency to ease to a four shot victory ahead of LIV Golf Series duo Brooks Koepka and Phil Mickelson. After two days of miserable weather had seen multiple suspensions of play at the 87th edition of the historic major, it was fitting that blue skies and sunshine set the backdrop for the crowning of Rahm, whose victory sees him leapfrog reigning Masters champion Scottie Scheffler as world No. 1. Having begun his tournament with a four-putt double bogey, Rahm recovered immediately and never looked back, carding a final round three-under 69 to finish 12-under. On the birthday of late Spanish golf icon Seve Ballesteros – champion in 1980 and 1983 – Rahm became the fourth Spaniard to win the green jacket and the first European golfer to win both The Masters and the US Open, following victory at Torrey Pines in 2021. Ballesteros, José María Olazábal, and Sergio Garcia were the only three of Rahm’s compatriots to have donned the green jacket previously, and Olazábal was one of the first to embrace the tearful new champion at the 18th green. “History of the game is a big part of why I play and one of the reasons why I play, Seve being one of them,” Rahm said. “If it wasn’t for that Ryder Cup in ’97, my dad and I talk about it all the time, we don’t know where I would be or where as a family we would be. “For me to get it done on the 40th anniversary of his win, his birthday, on Easter Sunday, it’s incredibly meaningful … I know he was pulling for me today.” Rahm made short work of the two shot lead taken into the final round by Koepka, who slid to a frustrating three-over 75 finish. The American had held at least a share of the lead from the end of the first round, but saw his dreams of a first green jacket and fifth career major fade quickly amid Rahm’s relentless afternoon charge. Mickelson rolled back the years with a final round-best 65 to become the oldest golfer ever to finish inside the top-five at the major. A three-time green jacket winner, the 52-year-old was all smiles as he eased round Augusta with eight birdies. It marks the lowest round ever posted by a player aged 50 or above, coming a day after Fred Couples became the oldest player to ever make the cut at the major. Jordan Spieth shot nine birdies in a blistering closing 66 to finish on seven-under. The 2015 champion finished level with Russell Henley and Patrick Reed, who made it three LIV Golf players inside the top four. A defense of the title looked unlikely from the moment Scheffler endured a frustrating second round 75, the American finishing eight shots adrift of Rahm, tied for 10th. Leading amateur Sam Bennett won hearts and plaudits after a superb week at Augusta. The 23-year-old Texan – who has a tattoo of his late father’s final piece of advice inscribed on his wrist – shot 76 to finish tied for 16th on his Masters debut. After two days of miserable conditions and stop-start action, clear blue skies finally broke above Augusta National on Sunday, prompting the green light for the race to escape a first Monday finish at the major since 1983. A battle to beat the clock had already ensued Saturday after bad weather Friday – featuring winds strong enough to fell three large pine trees – had suspended play overnight and left several players needing to finish their second rounds. That group included Rahm, who cut Koepka’s lead to two before the duo paired with Bennett to trudge through six holes of a rain-soaked third round Saturday. By the time the horn sounded to suspend play, Koepka’s four stroke cushion had been restored – the American weathering the storm expertly while his Spanish rival lost ground with back-to-back bogeys. Sunday’s bright weather brought a more familiar feel to the picturesque terrain of Augusta National, but there was no familiar sight of Tiger Woods’ classic Sunday red. Despite visibly struggling with movement throughout the weekend, the 15-time major champion had battled to a record-equaling 23rd cut, only to announce his withdrawal due to injury hours before play resumed on Sunday. Having admitted to being in “constant” pain after his opening round, pictures of the 47-year-old – rooted to the bottom of the leaderboard – hobbling towards his golf bag during his final holes of the weekend will only intensify questions of whether the five-time Masters champion will ever play the major again. Rahm had once again moved to within two strokes of Koepka as the pair approached the first tee for the final time, after the duo both carded one-over 72’s in the third round hours earlier. Koepka’s opening drive found the fairway: the ninth fairway. Yet the American recovered superbly from his wild opening hook, planting his follow-up onto the green before saving par. His relief didn’t last long. After Rahm sunk his first birdie of the day at the third, Koepka made bogeys at four and six. For the first time since the second hole on Friday, there was a new outright leader at the summit. Smelling blood, a steely-eyed Rahm accelerated, tapping home for birdie after knocking a brilliant approach to within a few feet at the eighth to move two clear. Koepka, meanwhile, was fading, dropping two more shots by the 12th hole. To make matters worse for the LIV Golf star, those behind had gathered momentum. Though Mickelson and Spieth ultimately left their charges too late to snatch victory, Koepka’s slide jumped Mickelson – already back in the clubhouse – up into solo second. It was fitting encapsulation of the day that when a frustrated Koepka finally converted his first birdie of the afternoon at the 13th – snapping a 22 hole streak without one – Rahm matched his effort mere seconds later. Any hopes of Koepka’s boost sparking a dramatic comeback were crushed at the following hole, as he bogeyed once again before Rahm coolly rolled home for birdie. What had looked set to be an enthralling two-horse race had turned into a canter. Up ahead, American duo Reed and Henley were running out of time to challenge, and even back-to-back birdies for Koepka at the 15th and 16th only cut the gap to three. Carrying a four shot lead into the final hole, there was a momentary scare for Rahm – perhaps his first genuine fright of the day – as his tee drive went sailing towards the trees. It made for scenes reminiscent of a year ago, when runaway leader Scheffler made a wobbly finish, four-putting to close. Yet, once again, the outcome was the same – Rahm hit a provisional only to later find his original ball had bounced back onto the fairway. A phenomenal approach onto the green allowed Rahm to fully bask in a champion’s ovation from the Augusta patrons. The ball had barely hit the bottom of the cup before Rahm had dropped his putter, raising his arms and head to the sky to toast a dominant triumph.

      ‘Don’t ever do that again’: Jon Rahm says Super Bowl winner Zach Ertz jinxed him after poor start to victorious Masters campaign
    ","Jon Rahm’s winning margin at the Masters of four shots suggested he had everything his own way over the weekend. But the gap between the Spaniard and his closest rivals, LIV Golf Series duo Brooks Koepka and Phil Mickelson, might have been even larger if it wasn’t for a contribution from a Super Bowl winning tight end. Despite being the embodiment of consistency in Sunday’s final round to claim his first green jacket and second career major at Augusta National, Rahm’s eventual title charge couldn’t have got off to a worse start. On the first hole of his opening round, Rahm had some uncharacteristic struggles as he four-putted for a double bogey on the first hole’s undulating green. Although he was able to recover over the course of the weekend and eventually claim his maiden Masters title, Rahm joked afterward that some text messages from Super Bowl winning tight end Zach Ertz jinxed his abilities on the opening hole. “For those people who believe in jinxing other players, people or whatever it may be, Thursday morning when I was getting on my golf cart to get to this putting green. Ten minutes before my tee time, I saw a text from a good friend of mine,” Rahm, dressed in his newly acquired green jacket, explained to reporters. “I’m going to name him because he is a Super Bowl winning champion – Zach Ertz – he sent the text: ‘That first green looking like a walk in the park,’ 10 minutes before I four-putted the start of the tournament.” With a smile, Rahm continued: “So, thank you Zach, don’t ever do that again please.” Ertz – who won Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles and now plays for the Arizona Cardinals – acknowledged the texts and said he had no regrets. “I apologize for absolutely nothing!” he tweeted. “You can expect these texts every major going forward my friend! Congratulations!” Ertz’s former Cardinals teammate JJ Watt, who retired at the end of the 2022 season, tweeted out screenshots of messages sent to a group chat called “Birdies and Babies” which included Rahm, Ertz and Watt which seemed to corroborate Rahm’s story with the caption: “Can confirm. I think this means you deserve a green jacket (Ertz).” Ertz text the group saying “Let’s have a day Jon!! Start fast!!” to which Watt replied: “Let’s go Jon!!! Pretend you’re playing with Zach and I. You’ll set the course record!” He followed up with: “First hole green looks like a walk in the park.” Watt also included a screenshot of a private text message exchange with Ertz. The tight end said: “4 putt to start the round… not ideal.” Watt replied: “Horrendous. I said pretend you’re playing WITH us not like your playing LIKE us,” which Ertz responded with a pair of laughing emojis. Despite the opening hole double bogey, Rahm wasn’t hampered for long, grabbing birdies on the following two holes as he shot an impressive seven-under opening-round 65. And he continued his steady rise up the leaderboard over the course of a disrupted four days, showing exemplary consistency to win the 2023 Masters.

      Editor ‘relieved of duties’ and publishing house apologizes after German magazine’s fake AI interview with Michael Schumacher
    ","The editor-in-chief of Die Aktuelle, a German magazine that published a fake artificial intelligence (AI) interview with Michael Schumacher, has been “relieved of her duties,” a statement from publishing house FUNKE said, alongside an apology to the Schumacher family. Anne Hoffmann had overseen the weekly German magazine since 2009, the statement added. The publishing house’s response comes after the family of seven-time Formula One champion Schumacher said on Thursday that it was planning legal action against the magazine. Schumacher has not been seen in public since he suffered a brain injury in a skiing accident in December 2013. “This tasteless and misleading article should never have appeared. It in no way meets the standards of journalism that we – and our readers – expect from a publishing house like FUNKE,” FUNKE magazine managing director Bianca Pohlmann said in the statement. On April 15, Die Aktuelle published a smiling picture of the 54-year-old on the front cover with the headline: “Michael Schumacher, the first interview,” and a subheading that reads: “It sounded deceptively real.” The fake interview appears on page eight of the magazine with the headline, “My life has changed completely,” and includes fictitious quotes attributed to Schumacher, discussing his family life since the accident and his medical condition. Only toward the end of the article does it become apparent that the interview was produced by AI. Since the accident, the Schumacher family has kept updates about the health of the motorsport legend to a minimum to protect their privacy. In September 2021, Corinna Schumacher discussed her husband’s condition in a Netflix documentary about his Formula One career. “He still shows me how strong he is every day,” she said at the time. “We live together at home. We do therapy. We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he’s comfortable. And to simply make him feel our family, our bond. “And no matter what, I will do everything I can. We all will. We’re trying to carry on as a family, the way Michael liked it and still does. And we are getting on with our lives. “‘Private is private,’ as he always said. It’s very important to me that he can continue to enjoy his private life as much as possible. Michael always protected us, and now we are protecting Michael.” ",388,motorsport,2023-04-22,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/motorsport/michael-schumacher-fake-ai-interview-apology-spt-intl/index.html

      Irish rally driver Craig Breen dies after accident during testing
    ","Irish rally car driver Craig Breen has died after an accident at a pre-event test ahead of next week’s Croatia Rally, his team Hyundai Motorsport said Thursday. The team did not give many details about the incident but said it had occurred just after midday local time on Thursday. “Hyundai Motorsport sends its sincerest condolences to Craig’s family, friends and his many fans,” a statement read, adding that co-driver James Fulton was unharmed in the accident. The 33-year-old had made 82 starts in the World Rally Championship (WRC), finishing second in his last race at Rally Sweden in February. Breen, whose dad Ray had also been a rally driver, started his career driving go-karts before transitioning to rally driving, going full-time in 2009 and progressing through the ranks. He quickly experienced success, being crowned Ireland’s Young Driver of the Year in 2009, and later becoming a regular on the WRC circuit. Despite not winning a WRC race, the Irishman claimed six second-place finishes. “The Irish motorsport community is numbed by this tragic news. Craig was a world class driver and a world class person,” Motorsport Ireland president Aiden Harper said in a statement. The World Rally Championship said on Twitter: “The WRC family is shocked and saddened to learn of Craig Breen’s passing. “Our thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of Craig at this incredibly sad time.” Mohammed Ben Sulayem, president of motorsport’s governing body FIA, also paid tribute to Breen. “Our thoughts & prayers are with his loved ones & the Rally community at this difficult time,” he said on Twitter.

      Max Verstappen wins chaotic Australian Grand Prix as Lewis Hamilton takes second
    ","Reigning world champion Max Verstappen won the Australian Grand Prix as Lewis Hamilton finished second in an incident-packed race in Melbourne on Sunday. In a chaotic race which featured three red flags, the race finished under a safety car and amid confusion. The Dutchman fell behind to Mercedes duo George Russell and Hamilton at the very start of the race but went on to secure his first win in Australia, dominating before a complicated, controversial finale. “We had a very poor start, and lap one I was careful because I had a lot to lose and they had a lot to win,” Verstappen told Sky Sports afterwards. “After that, the pace of the car was quick - you could see that straight away. “We were always there, waiting for the DRS for the chance to pass. But with these red flags, I don’t know. The first one, maybe you can do it but the second one I don’t understand. “So, it was a bit of a mess, but we survived everything and we won, which, of course, is the most important thing.” Fernando Alonso, despite finding himself in a spin with two laps to go, was third. That was because FIA regulations deemed that the final finishing positions be taken from the last restart, with the final lap competed behind a processional safety car. The safety car made its first appearance on the opening lap after Charles Leclerc’s collision with Lance Stroll, which led to the Ferrari driver’s retirement, then Alex Albon’s crash on lap six saw a second safety car and a red flag. After Albon’s crash, Hamilton initially led, but the speed of the Red Bull car told as Verstappen moved into the front. Late on in the race, confusion ensued as the safety car and a second red flag appeared – debris from Kevin Magnussen’s Haas had spread over the racing line after he had driven into a wall. According to the rules, two racing laps would remain after the restart. Carlos Sainz then clipped Alonso, who spun, which led to Pierre Gasly colliding with his Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon – both were in the points at fifth and 10th respectively before the penultimate restart – but were forced to retire. Sainz went on to receive a five-second penalty. Another red flag and a long wait followed before the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, made clear that the race order would remain as it was at the restart because not enough ground had been covered to update the classifications before the red flag was shown. That moved Alonso back up to third, with Sainz down to 12th because of his penalty. Since the final lap was completed behind the safety car, the final standings were as they had been in the previous restart, except for the cars that had been eliminated. Verstappen enjoyed a second win of the season, with Hamilton finishing on the podium for the first time this year. Russell retired on lap 18. Aston Martin’s Stroll was fourth, while Red Bull’s Sergio Perez was fifth.

      Lewis Hamilton delighted with ‘dream’ qualifying for Australian Grand Prix
    ","Lewis Hamilton qualified third for Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix and the seven-time world champion described the result as a “dream” for him and his Mercedes team. The Englishman did not win a race last season as Mercedes experienced a torrid 2022, the team’s run of eight successive constructors’ titles coming to an end as Red Bull took the title. Two races into the new season and Mercedes appeared set for another arduous campaign as Red Bull made a flying start, winning in both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Hamilton qualified in seventh for the two races of the season so his surprise at starting third on the grid for Sunday’s GP was understandable. “I’m so happy with this. This is totally unexpected,” he told reporters, according to F1.com. “Really, really proud of the team.” Hamilton’s teammate George Russell qualified second, behind world champion Max Verstappen, who secured pole for the first time in Melbourne. “George did a fantastic job today, so for us to be up in the two front rows is honestly a dream for us,” Hamilton added. “We are all working as hard as we can to be back right at the front, so to be this close to Red Bull is honestly incredible. “I hope tomorrow we can give them a bit of a run for their money, and we hope the weather is good.” Mercedes team Principal Toto Wolff told reporters that Verstappen was “in a league of his own” but said the Silver Arrows’ performance in qualifying had brought the team happiness. Verstappen achieved his 22nd career pole, setting a time of one minute 16.732 seconds. Russell was 0.236 secs behind, with Hamilton 0.372 secs off. Fernando Alonso qualified in fourth. Sergio Perez, winner of the Saudi Arabia GP, crashed on his first lap and will start the race at the back of the field.

      Formula One: Why the new season could be more dramatic than ever
    ","A new season and much has changed, yet much also remains the same in Formula One. No sport does personality, politics and drama quite like F1, which explains the global success of the Netflix docuseries “Drive to Survive,” the fifth season of which premiered last week. Fresh on our screens is last year’s F1 soap opera, from the anger around Red Bull’s 2021 budget cap breach to Fernando Alonso’s surprise move to Aston Martin. This year’s racing promises more high-speed incidents, both on and off the track. Even before the season opening race in Bahrain on March 5, there has been plenty to digest, suggesting season six of “Drive to Survive” will be just as enthralling as previous editions. The latest in a series of controversies over the 13 months of Mohammed Ben Sulayem’s presidency of the sport’s governing body, the FIA, involved a new rule introduced in December. Last month, a number of drivers, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, spoke openly about their concerns over the rule which banned drivers making “political, religious and personal statements.” The FIA, however, appeared to backtrack a few weeks later, issuing a “guidance” note which said the rule applied only during pre- and post-race events – and on the track. Earlier this week, F1 came under the spotlight once again after concerns were raised by a human rights group over what it claims is the sport’s ongoing role in “sportswashing” by holding races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In a statement to CNN on Monday, the FIA said it “cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,” while an F1 spokesperson told CNN the sport took its responsibilities “very seriously.” The first race weekend begins in Bahrain on March 3, with the Grand Prix itself on Sunday at 10 a.m. ET. Races are live in the US on ESPN and ESPN Deportes. In the UK, fans can watch on Sky Sports or Channel 4. For full details of how to watch where you are, click here. A record 23 races will be held this season, with Las Vegas hosting its first F1 race since the 1980s to become the third US city on the calendar, alongside Miami and Austin. Over the course of the year, Verstappen and his Red Bull team will likely be the ones to beat once again. Though three days of preseason testing don’t reveal all we need to know about competitiveness, both Red Bull cars looked strong on Bahrain’s Sakhir circuit last week, with Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez setting the fastest lap of the week. “The car is working really well,” Verstappen, the strong favorite to win a third world title, told reporters in Bahrain. “Just going through a lot of things we wanted to try. Just in general enjoying driving the car.” Interestingly, at the start of last year, Red Bull played down the team’s prospects, but this year, Verstappen is in a more bullish mood. Asked by reporters of his goal, Verstappen replied: “Our goal is to win – and win the championship – only.” Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was Verstappen’s closest rival last year but his words had less swagger at Saturday’s news conference, with the Ferrari driver saying the team had “some work to do,” before adding that Red Bull “seems to be very strong in these three days.” Leclerc and his teammate Carlos Sainz completed 416 laps of the circuit in testing and new team principal Fred Vasseur, whose task is to win a first championship since the constructors’ title in 2008, seemed happy enough with what he had seen. He told reporters: “The main target was getting as much mileage under our belt as possible and we did that, although it’s also true that you always want to do more and have more time. But it’s the same for everyone. “Whenever we managed to put everything together, the performance seemed to be there, but we are clearly still in the process of getting to know the car, so it’s too early to say anything. “The mood in the team is perfect and we are in a good shape to start this long season.” For Lewis Hamilton and George Russell’s Mercedes team, there was no sign of the bouncing that ruined their last season. Mercedes finished third overall last year, ending a run of eight successive constructors’ titles as Red Bull won 15 of 22 races. “We’re not quite where we want to be, but it’s a good platform to start from,” said Hamilton, who did not win a race last season. The best of the rest could be Aston Martin, who have replaced the retired Sebastian Vettel with two-time world champion Alonso. A decade after his last race victory, could Alonso be competitive enough to claim a 33rd race win this season? He was second fastest to Verstappen on day one of testing, third fastest on day two and ninth on the final day. Aston Martin finished seventh overall last year, but rivals seem to think they have made a big step during preseason. “It looks like their concept of car has moved them forward and they look like they’re not too far away. Fernando in particular looks very competitive,” Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told F1 television. Four of the 10 teams have new principals, an indication that managing F1 teams is increasingly becoming more akin to the results-driven nature of soccer management. Vassuer is Ferrari’s fifth team principal in under a decade. Replacing Vasseur at Sauber is Andreas Seidl, while Andrea Stella is now McLaren’s team principal and James Vowles has taken over at Williams. Another change is reduced points for shortened races. Full points were awarded at last year’s rain-hit Japanese GP, where Verstappen secured the title, but there was initial confusion as to whether or not the Dutchman had won the title and it needed the FIA to clarify at the time that the reduced points rule only applied to races that were suspended and could not be resumed. A cost cap adjustment also allows teams to spend an extra $1.2 million because of the extra race in the calendar. Improvements, adjustments and changes made in preparation for another year of storytelling in a sport which is unlike any other.

      Formula Equal: Inside the plans to launch a ‘50% male, 50% female’ F1 team
    ","For the past four years, Craig Pollock has been secretly laying the groundwork for a new Formula One team unlike any other already on the paddock. Now he’s ready share his plans with the world. Pollock knows how to build an F1 outfit from scratch having served as founder and CEO of British American Racing (BAR), which is now owned by Mercedes. His latest project, Formula Equal, would be the first team in the sport that’s 50% men and 50% women, he says, with that equal split applying across the whole organization – from the cockpit to the engineers to the boardroom. “Our ambition to deliver and build opportunities and pathways for women to get to the very top level inside motorsports,” Pollock tells CNN Sport’s Don Riddell in an exclusive interview. “The concept and the idea was to try and build a Formula One team, 50% male, 50% female, which is extremely hard to do if you have an existing Formula One team; it’s a lot easier with a clean sheet of paper.” If Pollock’s application for the team is successful, Formula Equal would potentially debut in 2026. It would be a notable development in a sport and industry often spotlighted for its lack of gender diversity. A 2016 survey conducted by the FIA, motorsport’s global governing body, found that, in European motorsport, women accounted for 6.5% of drivers, 16% of institutional employees, and 19% of volunteers. The FIA’s Women in Motorsport commission, launched in 2009, seeks to change those figures, advancing female participation on and off the track through events, initiatives and educational programs. Its ambassadors include Susie Wolff, who in 2014 became the first woman in 22 years to take part in a Grand Prix weekend, and Tatiana Calderon, who has served as a test driver for the Sauber F1 team, now Alfa Romeo. The FIA’s Girls on Track program, meanwhile, provides a competition model to develop and promote young women at a grassroots level in motorsports. For Pollock, Formula Equal is not just about getting women drivers in F1 cars, but also having equal representation throughout the team. “We know that we are going to have to go through our academy systems,” he says. “We know we’re going to have to build it up because there are not enough women at the moment who are trained up to the level of Formula One and they’ve got to earn a place in there at the same time.” There are currently 10 teams on the F1 grid, each with two drivers on the start line of every race throughout the season. Earlier this year, the FIA opened an application process to find “one or more” new F1 teams to join the championship in 2025, 2026, or 2027. Why has Pollock decided to speak publicly about his plans now? “Formula One is a little bit like a sieve,” he jokes, adding that his name was listed in connection to an application at a commission meeting. “You’ve got to be very careful who you talk to … I had to basically admit: yes, it’s correct. We have made an application and that was it.” As part of the selection process, the FIA will assess, among other things, a detailed business plan, the team’s experience, technical ability and resources, and the potential to raise and maintain sufficient funding. As well as being the CEO for BAR, Pollock was also manager for one-time F1 champion Jacques Villeneuve, so he is well aware of the huge amounts of money needed to get a team off the ground. He cites comments made by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff last year estimating that it would cost a new team around $1 billion to join F1. “We are in intense discussions with I would just say a Gulf area country,” says Pollock when ask about the funding behind his venture. “I’m not really in the position to talk about that and be fully open about it at this present time – that will come out in the very near future. And I just hope it’s going to work because … it does take a lot of money.” Such comments have fed speculation that Pollock’s backers are from Saudi Arabia, a country with bold ambitions in the sport having first hosted a grand prix in 2021. CNN has contacted the Saudi Arabia Motor Federation for comment but did not immediately receive a response. The Gulf state’s involvement in F1 hasn’t been without controversy. Last year’s race in Jeddah went ahead despite an attack on an oil storage facility near the track claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, while seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, as well as multiple human rights groups, have expressed unease about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record. “I still feel that as a sport going to places with human rights issues, such as this one, I feel that the sport is duty bound to raise awareness and try to leave a positive impact,” Hamilton said ahead of the race. “And I feel like it needs to do more.” Earlier this month, the human rights group Reprieve accused F1 of using the sport to give cover to abusive regimes. “For all the talk of ‘positive values’ and ‘accelerating change,’ Formula One has never seriously engaged with human rights and the way the sport is used to whitewash abuses by some of the world’s most repressive regimes,” said Reprieve Joint Executive Director Maya Foa. Additionally, having a mixed-gender motorsports team in Saudi Arabia would be significant considering the country barred Saudi women from driving until 2018. F1 has responded to questions about sportswashing – the practice of using a sport to project favorable images of a country around the world – by saying it has worked hard to be a “positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social, and cultural benefits.” Pollock also stresses that his team is focused on “deliver[ing] the opportunities and pathways for the women coming up.” He adds: “Obviously that is linked to equality, diversity, inclusion, and sustainability. This is not a question of me going to them [the Gulf state]. “In reality, it’s them having come to us because we have a turnkey operation with the business plan, with all the costings, with everything ready to go.” Pollock says that his project, if successful, would see the launch of the “first Formula One team that is truly outside of Europe” – thousands of miles from the heartland of the sport in the south of England where many teams are already based. “This has to be built from the bottom up in a Gulf state and this is what we are aiming to do,” he adds. “This is a long-term project – this is not short-term.” ",1121,motorsport,2023-03-28,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/motorsport/formula-equal-f1-motorsport-spt-intl/index.html

      New tracks, new formats, new rivals: Champion ‘Pecco’ Bagnaia returns to a transformed MotoGP
    ","The 2023 MotoGP season gets under way in Portimão, Portugal, this weekend and reigning world champion Francesco “Pecco” Bagnaia is steeling himself for a grueling defense of his hard-won crown. This year’s championship will be the longest in MotoGP history with 21 races on the calendar, as well as a completely new element to the racing weekend – half distance “sprint” races. Bagnaia admits he is unsure what to expect. “The new schedule is a totally different thing compared to past years, so it will be important to discover, as soon as possible, the way to improve the strategy to work for the race weekend,” the Italian told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell. “I tried two sprint races in the test, and they were quite tough, but I think we have worked so well at home to be prepared physically, my physical condition, and with my team we have worked well with the bike.” The announcement of the Sprint races last August caught some riders off guard. Yamaha’s Fabio Quartararo, who relinquished his title to Bagnaia in 2022, was less than enthusiastic, telling reporters that he thought they were a “stupid idea.” Bagnaia takes a more positive view. “I think it’s something that for us could work well,” he said. “But I have to try before saying something because it’s totally different, and maybe for the first part of the season you will not notice anything for your conditioning, but the second part of the season will be very tough considering the amount of races per month we have,” Bagnaia explained. “But I’m saying that I’m a fan of it because it’s something different and it’s something fans here [at the track] and fans at home can enjoy.” The Ducati rider does acknowledge that the physical demands of the new season format are a daunting prospect, however. “You don’t have time to relax before the main race because, during the sprint race, you have to race like in qualifying, so pushing 100%, [whereas] in the normal race you have to control the rear tire, to control the gap, so it’s a different way to work,” said Bagnaia. “We have more races than the past years, so 21 – plus 21 sprint races – so you will finish the season with 42 races and that will be very demanding, for sure. “Before saying something about it, I have to try it, and I’m looking forward to testing it on Saturday, but let’s see. I think this year will be more tough mentally than physically, but it’s too soon to say now.” Two completely new tracks have also been added to the 2023 calendar, with visits to Kazakhstan and India in prospect. “[They] will be something different, something new, but normally I like the new layout. I like to discover a new country and new tracks,” Bagnaia said. “We have just to see if the tracks are ready to have us as a guest, but we have to be prepared for everything.” The Turin-born rider has had a busy winter, announcing his engagement to his long-term partner, Domizia Castagnini, on Christmas Eve. He also made a renewed commitment to an old motor racing tradition, deciding to exercise his prerogative as world champion to place the number one on his Ducati. “Using number one on track again is something great,” the 26-year-old smiled. “I’m sure the pressure will be high on it, but I think we can be proud of it, so it’s better to have it on there.” History has not been kind to those carrying the number in the MotoGP era: no rider has managed to retain the crown with one on their bike. The methodical champion is aware of past failures. “Since I was young, the only two riders to repeat the championship were Marc (Márquez) and Valentino (Rossi), so I choose number one because I think it’s very important and [should] be mandatory that the world champion uses number one, so I’m very proud to have it, but now I have to work a lot to continue riding with number one, so I’m very honored for it.” One man standing in the way of his success is now very close to home. Fellow Italian Enea Bastianini joined the Ducati factory team in the winter, replacing Bagnaia’s devoted teammate, Australia’s Jack Miller. Bastianini’s uncompromising style ruffled his compatriot’s feathers on several occasions last season, and the atmosphere between the two did not always appear cordial. Bagnaia referred to his rival as “a bastard,” and while it was clearly said in jest, the comment underscored an, at times, visibly testy relationship. “In this moment, all the tests and at home, we have a good relationship because we’ve known each other for a long time,” said Bagnaia. “In the last races, the battles with him were intense, but I think we can enjoy everything. We are quite smart to understand that if we work together we can improve ourselves to be in front for the race, so we don’t have to use our strategy to have a bad relationship in the box because we need to focus on the race and we need to focus on working to be together in front in the race.” Another threat could come from a rejuvenated Márquez. The six-time MotoGP champion is finally back to full health after overcoming a series of debilitating injuries. The Honda rider told reporters in Portimão this week that he and his team are “not title contenders,” but Bagnaia disagrees. “For sure, Marc will want to be in front because he will want his revenge,” he said. “He will be in front for sure from the first race and will be a tough rival, but we are tough too. So we have to have a great battle, we have to work hard to be in front, and let’s see who will be the main contender.” ",983,motorsport,2023-03-25,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/25/motorsport/pecco-bagnaia-motogp-season-preview-2023-spt-intl/index.html

      Aaron Rodgers: What 39-year-old quarterback could bring to New York Jets
    ","It’s not often you see an all-time great quarterback, playing close to the peak of his powers, completely uprooting himself to a new team with the specific aim of Super Bowl glory. Well, that is unless you’re a fan of the Green Bay Packers or New York Jets. The two teams have history of moving elderly signal-callers, with the Jets trading for Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre from the Packers in 2008. And the two teams look set to do business again, with Aaron Rodgers the one potentially traveling from Wisconsin to New Jersey this time. After a long, drawn-out process, the trade would see the 39-year-old become the Gang Green’s new starting quarterback in the hopes of being the final jigsaw piece in the team’s Super Bowl aspirations. So what could Rodgers bring to the Jets? The clips of Rodgers at the 2005 NFL draft have become part of the sport’s folklore. A baby-faced Rodgers sits in the green room amongst the other college graduates and draft hopefuls. As a California kid and with the San Francisco 49ers holding the first overall pick in sore need of a quarterback, Rodgers was confident on where he would be playing. But to the surprise of many, the 49ers selected Alex Smith and Rodgers was forced to wait as names were called to the podium, none of which were his. As picks went by, Rodgers could be seen getting increasingly despondent until finally, with the 24th pick, the Packers handed their slip in with his name on it. Even though Rodgers had finally been drafted into the NFL, it was a double-edged sword for the California Golden Bears graduate as he became back-up to Favre – a position he held for two years. After Favre eventually left to the Jets, Rodgers was finally giving the keys to the franchise and he never looked back. Rodgers led the Packers to a Super Bowl title in his third season at the helm and has won four MVP titles as he became one of the NFL’s best quarterbacks. He’s also set countless records for his accuracy and deadliness over the years. Despite all the personal successes and winning records, Rodgers and the Packers failed to win more championship rings, wracking up numerous painful playoff losses. In recent years, Rodgers has voiced his creeping dissatisfaction with events in Green Bay, from the lack of offensive weapons he’s had to work with to the drafting of his heir-apparent, Jordan Love, in the first round of the 2020 draft. Rodgers has hinted at retirement on more than one occasion, and even visited a darkness retreat this offseason as he sought clarity on his future. On Wednesday, with free agency opening, Rodgers finally told the world that he intends to play for the Jets, despite admitting he was 90% sure he would retire as a Packer when he entered the retreat. “And also the reality of situation – it is what it is – the Packers would like to move on. They’ve let me know that in so many words. They’ve let other people know that in direct words,” Rodgers said during his regular appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show.” “And because I still have that fire and I want to play and I would like to play in New York, it’s just a matter of getting that done at this point.” Rodgers might turn 40 in December, but as Tom Brady has shown age is only a number when you’re an elite quarterback. Rodgers showed that he’s still one last season – despite a slight drop from his usual higher standards in a disappointing overall year for the Packers. After a poor start to the season, Rodgers lead the team on a four-game winning streak from a 4-8 record to help set up a Week 18 game with the Detroit Lions for a spot in the playoffs – the team lost 20-16 to end the Packers’ season. Although his ability to avoid on-rushing defenders might have diminished as he’s gotten older, Rodgers more than makes up for it with his precision and canniness before the snap, while he has the knack of maneuvering defenses to his will. And for the Jets, having a reliable, proficient quarterback will be a big upgrade from recent years. The team’s 2021 No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson has flattered to deceive so far, Sam Darnold lasted only a couple of years before being shipped out and any other fill-ins haven’t set the world on fire. Under general manager Joe Douglas and head coach Robert Saleh, the Jets have built up an extremely talented roster, with the quarterback position arguably the missing link. After last year’s excellent draft – both cornerback Sauce Gardner and wide receiver Garrett Wilson won rookie of the year awards while running back Breece Hall was putting down his own case for consideration for the award before a season-ending knee injury –  the Jets have plenty of young talent. And with the collection of veterans it has – such as Quinnen Williams, D.J. Reed and C.J. Mosley – including a stacked offensive line and an explosive defense, it sees itself as just one piece away from challenging for a championship title. Older quarterbacks moving close to the end of their careers isn’t unheard of – Brady swapped New England for Tampa Bay in 2020 at the age of 42, winning a Super Bowl title in his first season with the Buccaneers as a 43-year-old. Will Rodgers bring the franchise – known for their lack of success and time spent in the wilderness – their first ring since 1968 or will he struggle to settle in a new environment? One thing is for sure: we know Rodgers likes playing in green. ",962,sport,2023-03-16,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/sport/aaron-rodgers-profile-explainer-jets-packers-spt-intl

      Barack Obama: Former US President and basketball fan fills out his 2023 March Madness brackets
    ","Barack Obama’s love of basketball is well known so it comes as no surprise that the former US President has joined many others in filling out his March Madness brackets for this year’s men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments. Obama’s final four men’s teams are Houston, UCLA, Baylor and Duke, with No. 5 seeds Duke beating top seeds Houston in the national championship game. On the women’s side, Obama predicts that the undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks will defend their title by defeating fellow No. 1 seeds Indiana Hoosiers. It’s safe to say that Obama isn’t overly confident of filling out a perfect bracket – and no wonder given the odds of getting every result correct are an extraordinary one to nine quintillion. “It’s the best time of year! My #MarchMadness brackets will get busted soon enough, but here are my picks,” Obama posted on Twitter Wednesday, alongside pictures of his choices. CNN recently spoke to Tim Chartier, a distinguished visiting professor at the US National Museum of Mathematics, who explained the very slim chances of filling out a perfect bracket. “I’m going to pick one second in 292 billion years, and your job is to tell me which second I pick,” Chartier explains. “You’ve better odds that a family of four will all get hit by lightning in their lifetime than picking a perfect bracket. “There is a stat out there that there’s a one in 10,000 chance that you get injured by a toilet. So there are better odds that that same family of four all get injured by the toilet than picking a perfect bracket.” In the men’s tournament, the Duke Blue Devils start their campaign with a matchup against the Oral Roberts Golden Eagles. Obama’s pick in the women’s tournament, the South Carolina Gamecocks, will take on the Norfolk State Spartans as they look to defend their crown. Obama, who was the 44th US president, often played basketball in his youth and highlighted his love for the sport during his tenure in the White House. “Even though I never had the talent to play at the highest level, basketball still shaped my life. It taught me how to work hard, how to compete, how to be part of a team,” he told the NBA’s website in 2021.

      Ja Morant suspended for 8 games by NBA for ‘conduct detrimental to the league’
    ","Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant has been suspended by the NBA for eight games without pay for “conduct detrimental to the league,” officials announced Wednesday. The punishment follows an incident where Morant was seen in an Instagram Live video holding a gun at a nightclub outside Denver. The league said an investigation “did not conclude that the gun at issue belonged to Morant, was brought by him into the nightclub or was displayed by him beyond a brief period. The investigation also did not find that Morant possessed the gun while traveling with the team or in any NBA facility.” The suspension includes the five games Morant had already missed since the incident and Memphis’ games on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. He will be eligible to play Monday in a home game against the Dallas Mavericks. In an interview with ESPN on Wednesday, Morant said the gun in the video wasn’t his, and that he made a “terrible mistake” by posting the video of himself holding the weapon. He apologized to his team, his family and the league. “It’s not who I am,” Morant said. “I don’t condone any type of violence but I take full responsibility for my actions. I made a bad mistake, and I can see that image I painted over myself with my recent mistakes, but in the future, I’ll make sure everybody knows who Ja really is, and what I’m about and change this narrative.” Morant feels good mentally and has spent time this week trying to learn from his mistakes, he said. “I realized I have a lot of kids who look up to me, even probably some adults,” he said. ” I realized my past mistakes isn’t being a good role model. Got to be better in that area and be more responsible, be smarter and make better decisions.” Morant, who met Wednesday with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, told ESPN they had an “open discussion,” adding he appreciated their conversation. The 23-year-old’s conduct “was irresponsible, reckless and potentially very dangerous,” Silver said in a statement. “It also has serious consequences given his enormous following and influence, particularly among young fans who look up to him. “He has expressed sincere contrition and remorse for his behavior. Ja has also made it clear to me that he has learned from this incident and that he understands his obligations and responsibility to the Memphis Grizzlies and the broader NBA community extend well beyond his play on the court.” Earlier this month, the police department in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, said the agency would not recommend charges against Morant.

      New NCAA President Charlie Baker admits it’s a ‘tumultuous time’ in college sports
    ","Charlie Baker has been NCAA president for less than two weeks, but he knows he is coming into his role in the governing body of major college sports during a tumultuous time. Baker, most recently the governor of Massachusetts, said his friend Utah Sen. Mitt Romney described the transition from leader of a state to leader of a rule-making organization for student-athletes nationwide as “going from the frying pan and into the fire.” “I don’t think the people who say it is going through a tumultuous time are exaggerating. I mean, that’s the reason I took the job,” said Baker in his first televised interview since replacing Mark Emmert on March 1. “I could have done a lot of other things that would be a lot easier.” As NCAA president, Baker will oversee an organization for 520,000 athletes, 19,000 teams and 1,100 schools in three divisions. On the first day of the men’s basketball tournament, Baker –  who played basketball at Harvard – discussed with CNN’s Chris Wallace the challenges of the job, including rules on transgender athletes; gender equity; how student-athletes can profit from the use of their names, images and likeness (NIL) and transfers. And he also told CNN why he thinks there’s so much excitement for March Madness. “The fact that so many times the underdog wins, and the unpredictability and the competitive equity that seems to exist drives a big piece of that. As somebody who has witnessed major upsets in both the women’s and the men’s tournament over the years … I think that’s a big part of it,” Baker said. “You just don’t have that many places anymore, where it’s so obvious that no one knows who’s gonna win.” With regard to transgender competition and how each individual sport’s governing body will decide on rules for women’s sports participation, Baker said it is important to balance two issues: inclusion and competitive equity. “One of the reasons for following the national governing bodies and the international federations and the Olympic federations is you don’t want transgender athletes to have to play by different sets of rules at every step along the way in the process,” he said. Baker said standards for who can compete should be based on science and it shouldn’t be a problem if different sports have different standards. On swimmer Lia Thomas becoming the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title last year, Baker said, “I think Lia Thomas sent a pretty loud signal to everybody that people needed to get all of their data and all their information and all their rules up to date on this issue, which in many cases, they weren’t at that time.” Baker also spoke on questions of gender equity and the NCAA spending twice as much money on the men’s side of March Madness than the women’s side. “We are investing… in a very significant way, but we have a ton of work left to do on this and it’s not just about basketball, it’s about volleyball and softball and a whole bunch of other championships as well,” he said. NIL deals stem from an NCAA policy change in 2021 that allowed student-athletes to profit from sponsorship opportunities.  As college sports raise billions of dollars from television contracts, ticket sales and merchandise, supporters of the students have said players are being exploited and barred from the opportunity to monetize their talents. The deals, which reportedly can reach millions of dollars, need transparency and accountability for student-athletes and their families – something the current situation “doesn’t have,” Baker said. But it will be difficult for the NCAA to develop a national plan with states implementing their own laws on the topic, said Baker, a Republican who governed Massachusetts from January 2015 to January 2023. “If states passed laws that say things like, and many of them are currently contemplating these, ‘whatever the NCAA rules are in NIL, they don’t apply in our state,’ that creates an issue where you put schools and conferences, many of which involve multiple states, in an impossible position,” he said. “I think it’s incumbent on us to come up with a proposal that works in the absence of that [legislation], but I do think it will be harder to apply it to all 50 states if states passed laws that put schools in positions where they have to make a call.” And Baker said the transfer portal, which allows student-athletes to transfer from one college to another and play while no longer having to sit out for a year, is “an important element” of to the evolving NIL situation. “The two of them are related,” he told Wallace, who brought up the prospect of schools recruiting transfers who will be enticed by NIL possibilities.  “I don’t think you can talk about one without talking about the other. … You can’t make progress on these things without acknowledging their issues and then figuring out a way to actually solve and deal with them.” Baker added: “I don’t want people to forget that even in the big schools that show up on TV all the time – the vast majority of the kids who play in those sports are not going to go professional. And we need to make sure they graduate and that they graduate with a degree that they can actually make a life and a living with.” Baker said he is worried with all the money (and betting) that surrounds the tournament and college sports in general. “(Student athletes) are public figures in their world, the same way I was a public figure in mine,” the former governor said. “Now, I’m an old guy (66). I’ve been getting yelled at and screamed at for years by people for all kinds of reasons. I’m okay with that. … One student athlete told me about a teammate who just fell awkwardly on a playing field. Somebody filmed it and then posted it on social media and it had 15,000 comments and likes on it in a matter of hours. “That’s with nothing that’s got the significance of a missed shot, a missed score, you give up the winning hoop or something when it comes to sports betting. So I worry a lot about what the impact of that is going to be. … I think that could be a real problem.” ",1062,sport,2023-03-14,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/sport/ncaa-charlie-baker-president-spt-intl

      Kamila Valieva: Figure skater could not have achieved ‘perfection’ while doping, says Vladimir Putin
    ","Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended teenager figure skater Kamila Valieva, arguing it would be impossible to achieve “perfection” while using banned substances. “It is utterly impossible to achieve such perfection using unfair methods, with the help of additional substances and manipulations,” the Russian president said on Tuesday. “There is no place for such additional methods in the sport of figure skating and we all know it well and understand,” Putin said at a ceremony awarding Russia’s 2022 Beijing Olympic Games medalists on Tuesday, Russian state media TASS reported. Valieva became ensnared in a doping controversy at the Beijing 2022 Olympics after she tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, which is commonly used to treat angina, and which can enhance endurance by increasing blood flow to the heart. Although the 15-year-old failed a drugs test in December, before the Olympics, the result only came to light during the competition when it was analyzed and reported to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) in February. Valieva was then suspended the day after she had guided the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to a gold medal in the team event where she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump in a Winter Olympics. It remains unclear whether the medal will be revoked. She was later cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to compete in the women’s individual figure skating competition during which she fell multiple times, left the ice in tears, and ultimately finished fourth. Valieva had blamed the positive test on a mix-up with her grandfather’s drugs, as he uses trimetazidine for his heart condition. Russia’s history of widespread doping is well-documented; in 2019, Russian athletes were barred by WADA from international competitions over doping violations. On appeal, CAS ruled that individual Russian athletes could compete but would present themselves as ‘neutral athletes’ unable to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem. “The whole country, as well as figure skating fans across the globe, rooted for Kamila,” Putin said on Tuesday, according to TASS. “She managed to accumulate her talent, all of the most complicated figure skating elements, her plastique, beauty, the power and tenderness, as well as her hard work to bring this sport to the level of the true art,” he said. Putin’s comments came as the world of sport continues to shun Russia in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

      Winter Paralympics: Ukrainian athletes’ thoughts are with those fighting the invasion back home as they enjoy golden success in Beijing

Iryna Bui led the first Ukrainian podium sweep of the day in the women’s middle distance standing as Oleksandra Kononova claimed silve, while Liudmyla Liashenko completed the line-up with bronze. Kononova said she was proud to share the podium with her compatriots but admitted her mind was elsewhere with her country at war. “This medal is really special and unique for me because now we have a very difficult emotional pressure,” she said. “Despite that I’m physically here and competing, all my thoughts, my heart and my soul is with my family and with my child. “Emotionally, it’s very difficult to focus and to concentrate on the race and the competition, so this is the most difficult Paralympic Games for me.” READ: These are the sports that Russia has been suspended from Another Ukraine podium sweep was to follow just a few hours later in the men’s middle distance vision impaired. Vitaliy Lukyanenko won comfortably and in the process secured the eighth Paralympic gold medal of his career, with Anatoliy Kovalevskyi and Dmytro Suiarko crossing the line to win silver and bronze, respectively.

      Opening Ceremony: Call for peace as Ukraine’s presence keenly felt at Winter Paralympics
    ","The 2022 Winter Paralympics officially got under way on Friday, with the start of the Games marked by the presence of the full Ukrainian delegation inside Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium at the Opening Ceremony. All of Ukraine’s Para athletes made it to the Chinese capital – a feat described as a “miracle” by Valeriy Sushkevych, President of the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee – and their participation in these Games was met with a show of support from Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Parsons gave a stern speech that asked for peace in the world and expressed his dismay at ongoing conflicts, though stopped short of mentioning Ukraine or Russia by name. “Tonight, I want – I must – begin with a message of peace,” Parsons said. “As the leader of an organization with inclusion at its core, where diversity is celebrated and differences embraced, I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now. The 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate. “The Olympic Truce for peace during the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a UN resolution. It must be respected and observed, not violated.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted the world of sport, with numerous governing bodies imposing sanctions on Russia and its athletes. The IPC soon followed suit and, the day before the Paralympic Games were set to begin, took the decision to ban all Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in Beijing. Belarus remains a key military ally of Russia and is being used as a launch point for troops into Ukraine. “At the IPC we aspire for a better and more inclusive world, free from discrimination, free from hate, free from ignorance and free from conflict,” Parsons added. “Here in Beijing, Paralympic athletes from 46 different nations will compete with each other, not against each other. “Through sport they will showcase the best of humanity and highlight the values that should underpin a peaceful and inclusive world. Tonight, the Paralympic movement calls on world authorities to come together as athletes do, promote peace, understanding and inclusion. “The world must be a place for sharing, not dividing.” He ended his speech with a loud cry of “Peace!” A record number of Para athletes – around 700 – were expected to compete in Beijing, but much of the focus the day before the Opening Ceremony fell on the 83 who won’t. That’s after the IPC announced the U-turn decision to block Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the Games in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the IPC, backlash from the teams and athletes preparing to compete in Beijing was “jeopardising the viability” of the Games and making the safety of athletes “untenable,” even after Russian and Belarusian participants were set to compete as neutrals. The first events of the Winter Paralympics are scheduled for Saturday. The competition runs until March 13 and showcases 78 events across six Para sports: alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, para ice hockey, snowboarding and wheelchair curling. As with last month’s Winter Olympics, events will be held in the three separate zones of central Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou. READ: These are the sports Russia has been suspended from After Russian troops were first deployed in Ukraine last week, the IPC issued a condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s breach of the Olympic Truce – a resolution that orders conflicts around the world to be paused from seven days before the Winter Olympics to seven days after the Winter Paralympics. Then on Monday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) “recommended” that Russian and Belarusian athletes were either banned from international sporting events or allowed to compete as neutrals where the “short notice” of the decision would make a ban unfeasible. Earlier this week, Parsons said permitting Russian and Belarusian participation in Beijing, albeit as neutrals, was the “harshest possible punishment” at the governing body’s disposal, but pressure from the international Para sport community has forced the IPC to resort to sterner measures. A statement released by Ukrainian athletes said Russia and Belarus would use the Games as “state propaganda […] with or without a neutral label,” while Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said the decision not to issue a complete participation ban “excuses Russia’s disregard for not only the Olympic truce, but also for the victims of a senseless war.” The IPC was left in a “unique and impossible position,” according to Parsons, who said that multiple countries had threatened not to compete in Beijing. Having previously said that Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as neutrals, on Thursday, the IPC barred 71 athletes from Russia and 12 from Belarus from competing at the Games. “You are victims of your governments’ actions” was Parsons’ message to those impacted by the decision.

Host China will have a team of 96 athletes competing across all six sports over the course of the Games. Having claimed its first medal – a gold in wheelchair curling – in Pyeongchang four years ago, there are high expectations that this year’s Chinese team could deliver more success. Team USA topped the medal table at the last Winter Paralympics and has sent a 67-strong team – 28 of whom are making their Paralympic debuts – this year. Among the athletes returning to the team is Oksana Masters, a 10-time Paralympic medalist across the Summer and Winter Games who has competed in rowing, cycling, cross-country skiing and biathlon. Born in Ukraine before being adopted by her American mother, Masters is one of the most decorated Paralympic athletes from the past decade. Ahead of the Games, she said her “heart is breaking” for the country of her birth. Other stars of the American team include hockey player Declan Farmer – whose two goals helped the US defeat Canada and win gold at the last Games – and Dan Cnossen, a former Navy SEAL who claimed six medals in biathlon and cross-country skiing four years ago. On the Canadian team, cross-country skier Brian McKeever will compete in his sixth and final Paralympic Games at the age of 42. McKeever, the most decorated male cross-country skier at the Paralympics, has amassed 17 medals since his debut in 2002, 13 of which are gold. Ukraine has sent a full contingent of 20 athletes and nine guides to Beijing to compete in biathlon and cross-country skiing events. The team’s arrival in Beijing was hailed as a “miracle” by Sushkevych. “We came here from Ukraine and we traveled through Ukraine. It took us many days. We had to overcome a lot of barriers that had to do with the war,” Sushkevych told reporters on Thursday. “Many members of our team barely managed to escape from the bombardment and shells exploding, but still we made it here.” Sushkevych said he slept on the floor of the team’s bus for the last two days of their journey through Europe before boarding a flight to Beijing, adding: “We could have given up and not come to Beijing. This was the situation; bombs were exploding, missiles were exploding. “There’s a large-scale war in Ukraine. When simple things could not be organized, the easiest solution would have been to stay in Ukraine.” The Covid-19 countermeasures that were in place for the Winter Olympics in February are also being implemented for the Paralympics. That includes a “closed loop” system encompassing venues, conference centers, and hotels and connected by a transport service dedicated to the Games. Being fully vaccinated enables participants to enter the “closed loop” without quarantining, while those who aren’t vaccinated have to isolate for 21 days on arrival. Once inside the “closed loop,” Games participants are subjected to daily Covid-19 tests and, if they test positive, are confined to a room in an isolation facility until they return two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart. At the close of the Winter Olympics on February 20, a total of 437 Covid-19 cases were recorded among Olympics-related personnel after more than 1.8 million tests; 185 of those positive tests related to athletes and team officials. Between the end of the Olympics and Wednesday, which marked two days before the Opening Ceremony of the Paralympics, a further 17 cases of Covid-19 were recorded.
