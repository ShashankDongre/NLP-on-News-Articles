      China has an inflation problem. It’s way too low
    ","As much of the world fights desperately to bring down soaring prices that are slashing living standards, China is trying to do the opposite. Consumer prices rose by just 0.7% in March, compared with a year earlier. Factory gate prices fell for the six month in a row. In America, meanwhile, consumer price inflation was still 5% last month despite falling sharply; in the European Union it was 8.3% and in the United Kingdom 10.1%. Prices are stagnating or falling in China despite the fact that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been cutting interest rates and pumping cash into the financial system to bolster the economy, and despite the removal of strict Covid control measures late last year. Uncertainty over the economy means Chinese households continue to stash money into savings rather than going out to spend, and companies remain wary of making new investments. That’s raising the specter of a tailspin of falling prices and wages from which the economy may struggle to recover. “Our core view is that China’s economy is deflationary,” wrote Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, last week, soon after China released its first-quarter GDP growth figures. Although GDP expanded 4.5% in the first quarter, that growth largely reflected the impact of pent-up demand among shoppers following three years of pandemic restrictions, Yeung added. Stripping that out, GDP growth would have been only 2.6%. There’s plenty of money in the economy. The broad money supply, as measured by M2, increased by a record high of $5.6 trillion in the past 15 months. And the PBOC has been trying to encourage people to spend by boosting banking liquidity via multiple policy tools, such as open market operations and lowering reserve requirement ratios. But consumers appear to have barely reacted. Instead of spending money, people are hoarding cash at a record rate. Much of the new bank lending has gone to local governments, which were used to repay their high levels of debt, according to analysts. The unusual combination of price declines and unprecedented money supply in the economy has fueled talk of deflation. Deflation is defined as a sustained and broad decline in general price levels for goods and services over a period of time. It’s bad for the economy because, in such an environment, consumers and companies may put off spending in anticipation of prices falling further, which would only exacerbate economic problems. The problem plagued Japan’s stagnant economy for two decades, and its officials have only recently succeeded in starting to reverse the trend. “To describe China’s current economic situation in a word, deflation has begun, and the economy has fallen into recession territory,” said Liu Yuhui, a professor with a top government think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), during a recent speech that was widely circulated on social media. The pulse of the real economy is still “weak,” as real estate prices and financial assets “have not risen,” he added. Chinese households are heavily in debt and have no ability or willingness to spend, he said. Local governments, whose finances have been decimated by a combination of the real estate crash and the pandemic, are also acting like “zombies” because of their debt woes. “Due to the personal balance sheet issue … the willingness to use credit by various subjects in the entire economic system is rapidly collapsing,” Liu said. “The current China is the United States [of] 15 years ago, and Japan 30 years ago,” he added. Yu Yongding, a former director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the CASS, expressed a more cautious view. But he admitted that the economy was facing deflationary pressure. “In my opinion, although the statement ‘deflation has begun’ is not necessarily accurate, it is not a big mistake. Calling attention to deflation is entirely correct,” he wrote in an article posted last week on the Chinese news site Netease. “Insufficient aggregate demand is a prominent problem facing the economy.” A former central bank adviser, meanwhile, has urged Beijing to give cash handouts to consumers to stoke demand — a measure that was adopted by many major economies, such as the United States and Australia. But it has been rarely used by China’s central government. Li Daokui, a professor of economics at Tsinghua University who had served on the PBOC’s advisory committee, called on Beijing to hand out 500 billion yuan ($72.5 billion) in consumption vouchers to spur spending for the rest of this year. “Even with a conservative estimate, 500 billion yuan in consumption vouchers will drive one trillion yuan in overall consumption, ” Li said in a video posted on his Weibo social media account on Tuesday. In return, the government could receive at least 300 billion yuan through taxes generated by the increase in spending, he said “So it only takes 200 billion yuan in spending for the central government to drive one trillion yuan in consumption,” he said. “So why not do it? “ For its part, the PBOC has dismissed talk of deflation and defended its current policies. “There is no basis for long-term deflation or inflation,” said Zou Lan, an official with the PBOC, at a news conference in Beijing last Thursday. “As the financially supportive policies take effect, consumer demand is expected to warm up and price increases are likely to return to the average levels of previous years in the second half of this year,” he said.

      First Republic Bank to slash up to a quarter of its workforce
    ","First Republic Bank expects to cut its workforce by 20-25% this quarter, the embattled lender said late Monday. The layoff announcement comes as First Republic reported that its total deposits fell 41% in the first quarter, to $104.5 billion, even after a consortium of banks stepped in with $30 billion to prevent the regional lender from failing. Without that cash infusion, deposits would have fallen by over 50%. Analysts were expecting deposits to land at around $136.7 billion. The bank said it saw a sharp drop in deposit activity after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month, but that activity began to stabilize at the end of March and has since remained steady. “We experienced unprecedented deposit outflows,” said CEO Michael Roffler on an earnings call Monday afternoon. But deposit activity has evened out since the end of March, he added. “Total deposits were $102.7 billion as of April 21, 2023, down only 1.7% from March 31, 2023,” he said. That small drop, he added, likely reflected regular seasonal client tax payments. The call lasted about 13 minutes and Roffler did not take any questions from investors or the media. San Francisco-based First Republic also reported that year-over-year revenues were down 13.4%. Net interest income, the money a bank makes from charging interest on the loans they give out minus the interest they have to pay to depositors and other lenders, was down 19.4%. The bank reported earnings per share of $1.23, higher than analysts’ expectations of $0.85 per share, according to Refinitiv data. First Republic also said in its earnings release on Monday that it was “taking actions to strengthen its business and restructure its balance sheet.” Those actions include efforts to increase insured deposits. When the banking crisis erupted, about two-thirds of First Republic’s deposits were uninsured with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That’s lower than the 94% at Silicon Valley Bank — but at the end of last year, First Republic had an exceptionally high ratio of 111% for loans and long-term investments to deposits, according to S&P Global — meaning it has loaned and invested more money than it has in deposits. First Republic has seen its share price plummet nearly 90% since March 1. The drop comes as investors scrutinize lenders with a high amount of uninsured depositors — a response to the recent banking turmoil. The bank sits at the center of the ongoing regional banking chaos, and investors were looking, in particular, for any sign of a liquidity crunch — when banks have insufficient cash available to meet demands for withdrawals and debt repayment. “We expect that First Republic’s results will be a bellwether of sentiment for the sector,” wrote analysts at VandaTrack in a recent note. Roffler attempted to assure investors that the bank was liquid, telling investors on the Monday call that as of April 4, First Republic had twice the available liquidity of uninsured deposits (excluding the $30 billion received from large banks). But that didn’t seem to be enough: Shares of First Republic sank more than 21% in after hours trading after the earnings announcement, having closed up 12%. In addition to reducing its workforce by up to a quarter, the bank said it would take further steps to reduce its expenses. Those include significant reductions to executive compensation, condensing office space and reducing nonessential projects. There’s a lot of money on the line: In January and February, trading in First Republic stock was outright sleepy. Retail investors averaged just $20,000 in daily net purchases. But after the collapse of SVB, that daily average trading of the company’s stock exploded to $10.3 million, according to data through April 10 from VandaTrack. TD Ameritrade’s Investment Movement Index, which tracks retail traders, found that its clients were net buyers of First Republic Bank in March even as the company’s shares plummeted more than 88% over worries about uninsured deposits and the overall health of the banking system. So far — and it’s very early days — the optimism hasn’t paid off: First Republic has been hovering at $15 a share for the last six weeks, down from a range of $115 to $145 a share in the first two months of 2023.

      Supreme Court protects access to abortion pill
    ","The Supreme Court on Friday protected access to a widely used abortion drug by freezing lower-court rulings that placed restrictions on its usage as appeals play out. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug mifepristone and subsequent actions that made it more easily accessible will remain in place while appeals play out – potentially for months to come. The Friday night move is a striking victory for the Biden administration and its allies in the abortion rights community, which suffered a withering defeat at the Supreme Court last year when the conservative majority reversed the Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights nationwide. The court’s brief, unsigned order did not explain why it granted the request by the Biden administration and a manufacturer of the drug to intervene. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito publicly dissented; the votes of the other justices were not disclosed. The case is the most important abortion-related dispute to reach the high court since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade, triggering conservative states across the country to either ban or severely restrict the procedure. How the dispute over medication abortion is ultimately resolved could make it more difficult for women to obtain abortion, even in the states that still allow it. At issue is the scope of FDA’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective. Mifepristone has been used by millions of women across the country in the more than two decades that it has been on the market. The next step in the litigation will be a hearing in front of a New Orleans-based federal appeals court on May 17. “The case could well come back to the justices once the Fifth Circuit rules, but nothing is going to change with respect to mifepristone access until and unless the court both takes the case on the merits and sides with the challengers,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “That’s not going to happen for a long time – if ever.” President Joe Biden praised the order. “As a result of the Supreme Court’s stay, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and effective use while we continue this fight in the courts,” Biden said in a statement Friday evening. Biden also urged Americans “to use their vote as their voice, and elect a Congress who will pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v Wade.” A lawyer for the group of doctors who brought the challenge downplayed the order. “As is common practice, the Supreme Court has decided to maintain the status quo,” Erik Baptist, a lawyer for Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a statement. “Our case seeking to put women’s health above politics continues on an expedited basis in the lower courts,” Baptist added. “We look forward to a final outcome in this case that will hold the FDA accountable.” In his dissent, Alito said he voted to deny the request for a stay because the 5th Circuit has scheduled such an expedited hearing on the merits of the dispute. He suggested that allowing the restrictions to remain in place would not lead to “any real harm during the presumably short period at issue.” Alito wrote that the stay would not “remove mifepristone from the market” but would have simply restored “the circumstances that existed” from the time the drug was approved in 2000 to when the FDA passed new regulations to ease access to the pill starting in 2016. “The Government has not dispelled legitimate doubts that it would even obey an unfavorable order in these cases, much less that it would choose to take enforcement action to which it has strong objections,” Alito wrote. No other justice joined his dissent. Danco Laboratories, the manufacturer of the drug that intervened in the case to defend mifepristone’s approval, cheered the Friday order for preserving “crucial access to a drug relied on by millions of patients.” “The lower courts’ reversal of longstanding FDA approvals has caused widespread chaos among providers, patients, and healthcare systems. Today’s order provides continuity to all concerned as we litigate the underlying issues in this case,” Jessica Ellsworth, Danco’s attorney, said in a statement. The other manufacturer of the drug, GenBioPro, did not intervene in the lawsuit, but the FDA’s approval of their product – the generic version of the abortion pill – would have been suspended had the Supreme Court left the lower court rulings in effect. “Today’s Supreme Court ruling keeps mifepristone lawful and available,” the company’s CEO Evan Masingill said in a statement responding to Friday night’s order. “GenBioPro is continuing to serve its customers and is committed to providing our evidence-based, essential medication to all who need it.” US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the order was ” an important step in the right direction” as the administration “vigorously” fights “to defend the FDA’s independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription drugs.” “We are confident the law is on our side and remain focused on prevailing in court,” he said. The Justice Department declined to comment. The legal controversy began last November when a group representing doctors who oppose abortion filed suit, arguing that the FDA had not done enough to ensure the safety of the drug some two decades earlier. US District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, issued a broad ruling on April 7 that blocked the approval of the drug, as well as changes the FDA made in subsequent years to make the drug more accessible. He, however, delayed the effective date of his ruling by seven days to give time for an appeal. Rejecting the consensus of the medical community, Kacsmaryk raised questions about the safety of the drug, peppering his opinion with jargon that is often used by opponents of abortion. He labeled doctors who perform the procedure “abortionists” and explained that he would reject the term “fetus” in favor of the more inflammatory “unborn human.” Instead of referring to the procedure as a “medication abortion,” he insisted on calling it a “chemical abortion.” The FDA, Kacsmaryk contended at one point, “acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns – in violation of its statutory duty – based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions.” Mainstream medical associations have rebuked his assertions about the dangers of the drug, and mifepristone has been shown to be safer than common medicines like penicillin and Viagra. On a key threshold issue, the judge insisted that the plaintiffs – doctors who do not use or prescribe the drug – had the legal right to be in court to make their case because they allege that the use of the drug could “overwhelm” the medical system. Stunned by the breadth of the decision, the Biden administration and Danco, a manufacturer of the drug, filed an appeal with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court ultimately let stand the government’s approval of the drug, but agreed with Kacsmaryk that access could be limited. A divided three-judge panel ordered a return to the stricter, pre-2016 FDA regime around the drug, which prevents mailing the pill to patients who obtained it through telehealth, or virtual visits with their providers, rather than traveling to a clinic or hospital to obtain the drug in person. It also effectively revokes the 2019 approval of the generic version of the drug. The restrictions also affect the instructions on the label for the medication, shortening the window of obtaining the pill to seven weeks into pregnancy as opposed to 10. It’s possible however that even with the ruling in effect, some providers could go “off-label” and continue to prescribe mifepristone up until 10 weeks. The 5th Circuit claimed that the FDA’s rules for the drug created “an exceedingly unusual regime,” and that the anti-abortion doctors had the right to sue over it because they would “necessarily be injured by the consequences” of the FDA’s decision “to cut out doctors from the prescription and administration of mifepristone.” The appeals court said that the statute of limitations likely barred the plaintiffs from challenging the 2000 approval, but that they were likely to succeed in their claims against the FDA’s more recent moves to adjust the rules around the drug. The court accused the FDA of having an “ostrich’s-head-in-the-sand approach” to the drug that was “deeply troubling.” Biden last week decried how those lower courts had handled the case. “I think it’s outrageous what the court has done, relative to concluding that they’re going to overrule the FDA on whether something is safe or not,” he said. “I think it’s out of their domain.” The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene last week, with court filings from Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar citing “unprecedented lower court orders countermanding FDA’s scientific judgment and unleashing regulatory chaos by suspending the existing FDA-approved conditions of use for mifepristone.” Implementing the changes to mifepristone’s rules ordered by the lower courts would “deny women lawful access to a drug FDA deemed a safe and effective alternative to invasive surgical abortion,” while putting the FDA and the entities they regulate “in an impossible position.” Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of the brand-name version of the drug that had intervened in the case to defend FDA’s approval of mifepristone, also requested the high court to step in. Leaving the lower court rulings in place, the company’s attorney said in filings, would “irreparably harm Danco, which will be unable to both conduct its business nationwide and comply with its legal obligations.” “The lack of emergency relief from this Court will also harm women, the healthcare system, the pharmaceutical industry, States’ sovereignty interests, and the separation-of-powers,” the attorney, Ellsworth, told the justices. The anti-abortion doctors who had brought the case meanwhile told the justices that the restrictions the appeals court placed on the drug were “reasonable.” “The lower courts’ meticulous decisions do not second-guess the agency’s scientific determinations; they merely require the agency to follow the law,” the challengers argued. This story has been updated with additional details. ",1697,politics,2023-04-21,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/politics/supreme-court-abortion-pill-mifepristone/index.html

      What is mifepristone, the drug at the heart of the Texas medication abortion lawsuit?
    ","The US Supreme Court stayed a ruling by a federal judge in Texas to suspend the approval of mifepristone, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that has been shown to be safe and effective for more than two decades. The lawsuit from anti-abortion advocates claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn’t study it enough to approve it. Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery. Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it’s sometimes known as RU 486. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period. This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show. Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country’s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, which signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone’s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show. Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra – used to treat erectile dysfunction – is nearly 10 times higher. Mifepristone usually doesn’t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA. Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are “exceedingly rare,” happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations’ amicus brief. The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Preliminary data published February 2022 from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, showed that medication abortion accounted for 53% of all abortions in the US. No matter the status of mifepristone, misoprostol would still be available and could be used for a medication abortion on its own. The only use of misoprostol that’s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it “off-label” by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor. Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a “reasonable” option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective. This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization. People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, said Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Massachusetts and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Misoprostol still works very well and is very safe,” Wong said. “Mifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.” ",783,health,2023-03-15,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/health/mifepristone-what-is-it/index.html

      After fall of Roe, future doctors show less interest in training in states with abortion bans or as ob/gyns
    ","The Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal right to an abortion created a patchwork of laws across the United States and widespread uncertainty. Among those with questions are the nation’s future doctors. Morgan Levy, a medical school student at the University of Miami, said the impacts of the ruling immediately became a point of discussion among her peers. She’ll be applying to residency training programs this fall, and now has to assess whether the new laws will affect what she’s taught and how. “More than ever, I recognize the importance of good, comprehensive, evidence-based reproductive health care,” said Levy, who plans to train as an ob/gyn. In some states, though, it has become “all but impossible” to get formal family planning training, including abortion practices. “There is definitely a consideration of making sure that the training programs that I’m applying to are going to be able to provide the kind of training that I’m going to need in order to be able to do that for my patients,” she said. And new data suggests that these restrictions are having an impact on where – and what – future doctors plan to practice. The number of medical school students who applied to residency training programs ticked down last year, and applications to programs in states with abortion bans dropped the most, according to a new analysis from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Interest in the ob/gyn speciality took a notable dip, with applications dropping 5% nationwide and twice as much in states where abortion is banned. Emergency medicine also saw a significantly large drop in applications. Despite the decline in applications, all ob/gyn residency positions and most others were filled. So while there’s no immediate shortage of physicians in-training, experts say the shift is reason for concern. “I worry about exacerbating these maternal health care and abortion deserts that already exist. We already have a gap,” said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn in New Jersey and chair of the board of directors for Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Because of that, we need more ob/gyns to join the field to help build up practice in places where we’re losing providers for other reasons.” More than a third of US counties have limited or no access to maternity care, according to a recent report – and there’s notable overlap between maternity care deserts and states where abortion access is limited. Most physicians stay in the area that they trained. If programs in states with abortion bans shift to less desirable training plans, more and more students could prioritize being in less restrictive states for residency – and eventually to practice. Long-term, that could create a “tiered system of health care,” Brandi said. However, experts say it will be important to track the preferences for medical school students in the years to come. Last year’s graduating class applied to residency programs just months after the Supreme Court’s ruling. They had to make decisions before seeing exactly how the programs would react and adjust. “For the next year or two, things are gonna be really uncertain for people. And I think that many people didn’t want to engage in that uncertainty, not knowing what they were signing up for,” Brandi said. For Levy and others, perhaps more important than the specific location of a program is evidence that there is a strong and well-established commitment to training around family planning. “That’s really a green flag to me when programs have a really formal plan in place,” Levy said. The Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell has long participated in the Ryan Residency Training Program that offers a specific focus on abortion and family planning. Dr. Nagaraj Gabbur, who is the director of the ob/gyn residency program there, said that this specialized curriculum is usually one of the top reasons applicants give for why they want to practice there – and especially in the latest round of interviews. For programs outside of “haven states” like New York, this could involve an out-of-state rotation. But for Brandi, rotational programs are just a “Band-Aid” that don’t address the underlying issues challenging reproductive health care – and don’t consider the livelihood of the individual trainee. Also, most of the physicians in the ob/gyn field are women. Even if certain training programs suffice, there might be personal concerns about living in states where abortion is banned, she says. “This may impact not only the care that they want to provide as physicians, but also the care they can receive themselves,” Brandi said. As Levy and her peers consider a major step forward for their lives and career, discussions on the topic are constant – and complicated. “It’s not a black or white or red versus blue kind of issue,” Levy said. There are a lot of mixed emotions as people weigh many different factors, including clinical interests, logistics of the role, personal preference for location and broader implications. Some feel strongly that they should train in a state that has preserved access to abortion, while others, like Levy, feel that there may be opportunity for advocacy in more restrictive environments. “It’s almost less so about the state itself and more so about the program’s attitudes and responses to the decision and the ways in which they’ve affirmed their commitment to making sure great care is provided in their states,” Levy said.

      The cost of senior care is rising while caregivers are ‘drowning’ without help
    ","For most of her life, Tammy La Barbera has been taking care of someone other than herself. First, it was her two children. Then, it was her brother and father, who both died after being diagnosed with cancer. Now, Tammy is taking care of her 90-year-old mother, Ada, who was diagnosed with dementia five years ago. In recent months, Ada’s condition deteriorated so quickly that Tammy resigned from her job as an event manager to become a full-time caregiver. “I don’t have help here, and I know it’s going to get worse,” she said. Tammy, 53, struggles to provide her mother with the care she needs and would like to place her in a memory care facility equipped to handle the mood swings and outbursts that her mother has due to her condition. But Tammy says she doesn’t expect to ever have enough money to pay for that care. Recently, she said, she looked into an assisted living facility near her home in Murrieta, California. She says placing her mother at the facility – or others like it – would cost between $7,000 and $10,000 a month out-of-pocket. Across the country, millions of caregivers like Tammy are looking after a loved one – a relative or a friend. About 53 million US adults are caregivers, according to a 2020 report from AARP. Sixty-three percent of US caregivers who look after adults said the person they were looking after needed care because of “long-term physical conditions,” the report says. Since her mother’s diagnosis, Tammy’s life has been turned upside-down. Ada cannot bathe herself or cook for herself. Most days, she doesn’t even remember who her daughter is. “All her daily duties are done by me,” Tammy said, caring for her mother all day is like being a prisoner in her own home. Sooner or later, she said, she will have to move her mother to a long-term care facility and do whatever she can to pay for it. “I know that I’m reaching a crossroads with my mom’s care, and I’m trying to do this as long as I can,” Tammy said. “But I know the way things are going, and if she’s progressing pretty rapidly, I’m not going to have a choice.” Ada La Barbera was a teacher for 20 years, so she gets a pension check each month. Tammy puts that money, along with her mother’s monthly Social Security checks, toward bills. It’s just over $3,300 a month, and along with Tammy’s dwindling savings, it’s barely enough to keep them afloat, Tammy says. She can barely afford her rent. It’s because of her financial struggles that Tammy has been putting off long-term care for her mother. Where Tammy and Ada live in California, a home health aide would cost about $137 for one hour of care, according to an online calculator from AARP. “When you’re on a fixed income, you can’t afford that,” Tammy said. “So I don’t have the luxury to do that.” A long-term care facility is even more expensive. On average, it costs $10,830 a month to stay at a nursing home and $5,806 per month for an assisted living facility, according to the nonprofit National Investment Center for Senior Housing and Care. Then there is memory care, where Tammy says her mother belongs. Memory care facilities are the fastest-growing sector of the senior housing market, according to the National Investment Center. On average, memory care costs just over $7,500 a month, center COO Chuck Harry says. These facilities offer more hands-on care for people with dementia. They can include special features like locked units that prevent wandering patients from leaving the facility unattended and enclosed outdoor spaces where patients can move about safely. A nurse comes to see Ada at home every other week. During that 40-minute visit, Ada’s vitals are checked, and her medications are adjusted. Those visits are covered by Medicare, Tammy says. Medicare is a medical health insurance program that is for people 65 years or older. But Medicare does not cover the cost of a long-term care facility. And although Ada and Tammy are on a fixed income, Ada doesn’t qualify for other federal safety net programs like Medicaid because Tammy says they are not considered low-income. For middle-income families, Medicaid goes into effect only after a family has gone through the process of “spending down” their assets until they qualify for the program. “That is usually the path of anyone going into a nursing home for the long term: spending your own money – which is all out of pocket – and then reaching a Medicaid level of eligibility,” said Susan Reinhard, senior vice president and director of the AARP Public Policy Institute, noting that each state has its own Medicaid program and process. Until a family qualifies for Medicaid, the program will only cover the medical costs of a stay at a long-term facility, not room and board. Caroline Pearson, the lead author of a landmark 2019 demographic study called “The Forgotten Middle,” says most middle-income Americans find themselves in a position where they are too “wealthy” to receive Medicaid coverage for long-term care services but too “poor” to afford the out-of-pocket costs of that care. So why does putting a loved one in a nursing home or an assisted living facility cost so much? Providing long-term care services is expensive, Pearson says, adding that the senior housing industry requires a large workforce of nurses and staff to support it. That is also expensive. Additionally, as seniors sell their homes and move into these facilities, long-term care facilitators are essentially providing housing, she said. And housing is not cheap. The senior housing industry also caters to a high-income population, according to Pearson, who is now executive director of the Peterson Center on Healthcare. “The fit and finish at the buildings … [residents] expect to be really high-end. The amount of amenities and services that are part of that senior housing property … they expect to be high-end,” she said. “The market has seen good returns and then replicated that model.” And the demand for high-quality, long-term care is only expected to go up as the baby boomer generation continues to age, according to Pearson. “Most people don’t begin to need long-term care services until between 75 and 85. And so as the baby boomers hit those ages, that is where we’re going to see that demand really explode,” she said. According to the US Census Bureau, baby boomers – people born from 1946 to 1964 – will all be over the age of 65 by 2030. The oldest members of that generation will be 84 at that point. In 2019, there were about 8 million middle-income seniors – people 75 and older – living in the United States, Pearson says in her study. She projects that there will be 14.4 million middle-income seniors in the US by 2029, with 60% expected to have mobility limitations and 20% expected to have “high health care and functional needs.” “We are going to [have] double the number of middle-income seniors when the baby boomers age,” Pearson said. “Fewer of those baby boomers are going to have spouses or children who live nearby to provide unpaid caregiving support.” Most family caregivers are spouses or middle-age daughters, the study notes. At the end of the day, Pearson says, many Americans don’t think about aging until it’s staring them in the face. “People [think] that they will live healthy and independently until they die, and sadly, that’s just statistically very unlikely for most people,” she said. Tammy says her family thought they were prepared for the future. In 1965, Ada married Tammy’s father, Peter “Jazz” La Barbera, an accountant. “My dad was a very, very good saver, and he did have a little bit of savings,” Tammy said. “He was set just for the future, not for anything unexpected.” In 1970, Tammy was born in Queens. She and her older brother, Peter Jr., grew up an hour outside New York City. “We had a small house, and we lived in that house our whole lives, and … we were the perfect family,” Tammy said. She eventually moved to California, where she had two kids. Her parents followed, along with her brother and his wife. But soon after the move, Peter Jr. was diagnosed with cancer, and he died a year later. Two years after that, Tammy’s father received a cancer diagnosis and died within seven weeks. Tammy believes that the physical and financial toll of taking care of her son and husband kickstarted her mother’s health problems. Shortly after her husband died, Ada had a minor stroke and was diagnosed with dementia. “It’s almost like her grief was so overwhelming. Especially losing her son. I don’t think her brain had the capacity to deal with anything else anymore,” Tammy said. The stress associated with taking care of a loved one full-time, or even part-time, can have negative consequences, research has shown. Some of the physical symptoms associated with taking care of someone with dementia include higher levels of depression and anxiety, worse self-reported physical health, compromised immune function and increased risk of early death, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Over half (53%) of caregivers indicate that a decline in their health compromises their ability to provide care, according to the CDC. “I have sacrificed 10 years of my life being a caretaker, and I don’t have a life,” Tammy said. “It’s an honor to take care of my mother. But doing this every single day … it’s a lot.” Tammy is preparing for her own future by taking part in genetic testing that will tell her whether she is more likely to develop dementia like her mother. “I would like to prepare as much as I can, whether it’s medication or adjusting my life,” she said. “I just don’t want to put my kids through this.” She would also like to see changes to the system. Pearson says the solution to the cost issue is not simple and will probably be resolved only through a combination of incremental Medicaid expansion, changes to the senior housing industry and federal subsidies. AARP’s Reinhard says tax credits for family caregivers could help people like Tammy get a break. Employers could also help by supporting workers who need to stop working to care for a family member or friend. In September, the US Department of Health and Human Services, through its Administration for Community Living, announced a national strategy aimed at supporting family caregivers, highlighting nearly 350 actions the federal government will take. The strategy also includes 150 actions that it says local governments, communities and private businesses can adopt to help build a more supportive system. “Supporting family caregivers is an urgent public health issue, exacerbated by the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a news release. “This national strategy recognizes the critical role family caregivers play in a loved one’s life.” Gal Wettstein, a senior research economist for the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, says it would be beneficial for middle-income Americans to speak to a financial adviser as early as possible and transfer assets to a family member if they think they might need to enter a long-term care facility in the near future. This way, if their only option is to spend down their assets to become eligible for Medicaid, they hit that eligibility sooner. Long-term care insurance is another option, but experts say it’s rarely sold anymore because it is typically more expensive than other kinds of insurance. Pearson says Americans can plan ahead by investing in long-term care insurance in their 40s for it to benefit them when they will most likely need it, in their 80s. Wettstein also recommends long-term care insurance. “[Long-term care insurance] plans are getting harder and harder to sign, but they do still exist. Some insurers will still sell them,” he said. Ultimately, covering the cost of senior care comes down to families and how much they save for the future, until changes are made by senior housing providers and policy makers. “We are so far away from having any sort of swift and universal solution,” Pearson said. For now, Ada is on a waitlist for a spot at a skilled-nursing home about an hour from where they live. If she moves there, her cost of living might be partially covered through a Medicaid program. Tammy was told that Ada is one of more than 2,000 people waiting for a spot. “We’re drowning. We’re care workers, and we’re drowning,” Tammy said. “We don’t have help.” ",2109,health,2023-04-20,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/health/senior-care-cost/index.html

      CDC signs off on additional Covid-19 booster doses for certain people
    ","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its recommendations on the Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday to allow another dose of the bivalent booster for people who are 65 and older or who have weakened immune systems and who “want the option of added protection” against the coronavirus. The move aligns with Tuesday’s US Food and Drug Administration actions to allow these groups to get additional booster doses ahead of the fall vaccination campaign. On Wednesday, members of CDC’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices met to discuss the changes and expressed their support for them, although the committee did not vote. Monovalent mRNA vaccines, which protect only against the original strain of the coronavirus, will no longer be recommended in the United States, the CDC says. The updated bivalent shots from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech protect against the original strain as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant. The CDC now recommends the updated vaccines for everyone 6 and older, even if they didn’t finish the two-dose series of the original shots. People who are 6 and older who have already gotten a dose of the updated vaccine do not need more shots now unless they’re 65 and older or have a weakened immune system, the agency says. The updated boosters have been available in the US since September under emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, which restrict how they may be given. The FDA amended these EUAs on Tuesday to allow certain groups to get an additional dose ahead of other people. The FDA also urged anyone who hasn’t gotten their first dose of the bivalent booster to do so. Only about 17% of eligible Americans – fewer than 1 in 5 – has gotten a recommended booster dose. As time has passed, many adults with reduced immune function because of their age or an underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose of the bivalent vaccines. The CDC has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane. But the agency had previously not been free to make a “permissive use” recommendation about the boosters that would allow doctors to offer additional doses to vulnerable people. The FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations for most Americans after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.

      A quarter of Americans live with polluted air, with people of color and those in Western states disproportionately affected, report says
    ","About 1 in 4 people in the United States – more than 119 million residents – live with air pollution that can hurt their health and shorten their lives, according to a new report from the American Lung Association. People of color are disproportionately affected, as are residents of Western cities. Since President Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act in 1970, emissions of outdoor air pollutants have fallen 78%, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. But Wednesday’s 2023 State of the Air report, which focuses on ozone and particle pollution, shows that millions put their health on the line every time they step outside. To capture pollution levels at the county level, researchers analyzed data collected by the EPA’s Air Quality System, a repository of ambient air quality data from more than 10,000 monitors. They characterized the hourly average ozone concentration and the 24-hour average particle pollution concentration for 2019-21 at each monitoring site and factored in year-round pollution information from the EPA. There were significant improvements in some areas. Generally, 17.6 million fewer people were breathing unhealthy air than in last year’s report, due largely to falling levels of ozone in some regions. Ozone pollution is the main ingredient in smog. It comes from cars, power plants and refineries. Exposure to ozone can immediately exacerbate asthma symptoms, and people with long-term exposure to higher levels face a significantly higher risk of death from respiratory diseases than those who live with cleaner air. Around 25% more counties got an A grade in the report for lower levels of ozone pollution. Some of that improvement can be attributed to the Clean Air Act, according to Katherine Pruitt, author of the report and the American Lung Association’s national senior director for policy. Emission controls have helped, she said, as has the country’s continuing move away from its reliance on coal for its energy needs. Even something simple as the increase in the number of people who work from home has played a role. “The Biden administration has set themselves a good, strong to do list of things that will help with environmental justice and climate protection,” Pruitt said. “They’re moving kind of slow, though. So we’d like them to pick up the pace.” Despite the progress, not everyone was lucky enough to live in a county with good ozone levels. More than 100 million people live in counties that get an F for ozone smog, the report says. Western and Southwestern cities are the most ozone-polluted, with 10 of the 25 most-polluted cities in California. New York, Chicago and Hartford, Connecticut, were the only three on that list east of the Mississippi River. The five metropolitan areas with the worst ozone pollution are Los Angeles-Long Beach, California; Visalia, California; Bakersfield, California; Fresno-Madera-Hanford, California; and Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona. Particle pollution, the other form of pollution tracked in the report, still seems to be a significant issue for the US. Often hard to see, particle pollution is a mix of solid and liquid droplets that may come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants create it, as do cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires. Particle pollution is so tiny – 1/20th of a width of a human hair – that it can travel past your body’s usual defenses. Instead of being carried out when you exhale, it can get stuck in your lungs or go into your bloodstream. The particles cause irritation and inflammation and may lead to respiratory problems. Exposure can cause cancer, stroke or heart attack; it could also aggravate asthma, and it has even been associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety, studies show. The new report says the number of people living in counties with failing grades for daily spikes of particle pollution was the highest it has been in a decade. Nearly 64 million live with these kind of unhealthy spikes in counties that get failing grades. One driver of the high amounts of particle pollution are the wildfires that have consumed hundreds of thousands of acres. In 2021 alone, there were 14,407 fires, many in the West, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There used to be a wildfire season, experts say, but now they happen year-round. Those fires are why the regions with the highest concentrations of air pollution are largely in the West. When the American Lung Association started producing its report in 2004, 106 counties in 30 states got failing grades for daily spikes in particle pollution. Fewer than half were in eight states west of the Rocky Mountains. Today, 111 counties in 19 states got Fs for spikes in particle pollution, and all but eight counties are in the West, the report says. Urban centers in the Rust Belt and the industrialized East had gotten the most failing grades in the early 2000s, but many have cleaned up and now get passing grades. Bakersfield, California, displaced Fresno as the metropolitan area with the worst short-term particle pollution, but Fresno did not suddenly develop cleaner air. That city still had the most-polluted label for year-round particle pollution, tied with Visalia, in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley. Los Angeles is still the city with the worst ozone pollution, according to the report, as it has been for all but one of the years included in the report. California has some of the more progressive environmental legislation in the country, but the climate crisis has not been kind to the state, said Tarik Benmarhnia, an air pollution and wildfire researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who did not work on the new report. “All these cities like Bakersfield and Visalia are in a valley near the forests that are seeing big fires. There’s also intense agricultural and industrial work there, so they unfortunately have all the worst conditions for air pollution,” Benmarhnia said. There are some newcomers to the list of the 25 areas with the most particle pollution, including Denver and Fargo, North Dakota. Reno, Nevada; Yakima and Spokane, Washington; and Boise, Idaho; all made the worst list this year. San Luis Obispo, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle and Bellingham, Washington; all moved off the list of worst 25 cities. Residents in the cities ranked worst for particle pollution are living with more of it, the report says. In the top 25 cities with the worst air, the average number of days residents were exposed to high levels of fine particle pollution increased to a weighted average of 18.3, up from 16.5 in last year’s report. East of the Mississippi, Pittsburgh and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, were the two worst metropolitan areas in the country, posting more days high in fine particle pollution in this year’s report. Not everyone experiences pollution the same way in the US. Regardless of the region, communities of color bear the brunt of the problem. Specifically, although people of color make up 41% of the overall US population, they are 54% of the nearly 120 million people living in counties with at least one failing grade for unhealthy air. And in the counties with the worst air quality, 72% of the 18 million residents are people of color, the report said. Other research has also shown this trend. On maps that lay out areas with high levels of air pollution and where communities were redlined – areas where Black people were forced to live – they line up perfectly, Pruitt said. “Then, the other aspect is, when you have a community of color that is a voluntary community, people aren’t forced to live there, those are communities that tend to have less of a voice, so decision makers place polluting sources in those communities because there’s not as much howling by people with power when they do. So those communities get the highways; they get the landfills; they get the fence lines,” she said. There’s a myth that only poor communities live with disproportionate pollution levels, says Chris Tessum, a professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department of the University of Illinois. Tessum, who was not involved in the new report, says race really is the determining factor. “The thinking is that people with more money will buy better property, which has lower air pollution and that’s just the way of the world or whatever, but that’s just kind of emphatically not, not true,” he said. Communities need to play a key role in making decisions to help clean air, Tessum said. “People that have the power will use that power to benefit themselves and not the people that have been historically overburdened,” he said. The new report says government and residents can make a difference. One suggestion is to leverage Inflation Reduction Act funding to help reduce emissions at ports and to invest in zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles and in infrastructure that would improve air quality monitoring. States can also use the Clean Air Act authority to adopt the California zero-emissions standards for cars and trucks, the report says. At the federal level, agencies must finalize stronger limits on air pollution to truly protect public health and advance environmental justice, the report says, including standards to move the country toward zero-emissions vehicles. The EPA also has to set stronger national standards for particle pollution and ozone, the researchers say. Pruitt said she knows firsthand how better policies can work. She said growing up before the Clean Air Act, pollution was so high that she could see it every time she stepped outside. Today, the pollution is not nearly as visible. “I’m in my mid-60s, and of course, air pollution was very tangible when I was young, but these days, thank goodness it isn’t. Most people don’t see it,” she said. Unless a person has a lung condition, they may not even feel it. But just because you can’t see it or feel it doesn’t mean it’s not there. Pruitt encourages people to remember that no level of pollution is safe. The World Health Organization estimates that the combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. “People don’t really recognize that what they’re breathing is impacting their health,” Pruitt said.

      One death and almost 100 cases of rare fungal infection linked to Michigan paper mill, health officials say
    ","Ninety-seven confirmed or probable cases of blastomycosis have been identified in Michigan’s Delta and Menominee counties, according to the local health department, and they are believed to be associated with a paper mill in the town of Escanaba. One death has been associated with the outbreak: A contractor who worked at the Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill until recently passing away due to blastomycosis. “We were saddened to hear this news. Our heartfelt sympathies and prayers go out to the family, friends and co-workers who have lost their loved one,” county health officer Michael Snyder said in a news release. “Everyone at Billerud is deeply saddened by this news,” Brian Peterson, Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill’s vice president of operations, said. “Anyone who works at our facility is part of our team, and we are keeping this individual, their family, coworkers and friends in our thoughts and close to our hearts.” Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, Blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is predominantly found in the Midwest and the South, particularly around the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes. There are only one or two cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, according to the CDC. One analysis found 1,216 deaths related to the illness from 1990 to 2010. People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won’t get sick, some will develop symptoms like a fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC says. Other symptoms may include chest pain, trouble breathing, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and muscle or joint pain, according to Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties. In rare cases, the infection can spread outside the lungs to places like the skin, bones, brain and spinal cord. Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person. It’s treated with antifungal medication that must be taken for a period ranging from six months to a year, depending on the severity of the illness and the person’s overall health. Twenty-one of the cases linked to the mill have been confirmed by culture or microscope, and the other 76 are probable, meaning the person had symptoms of blastomycosis and a positive antigen or antibody test, the health department said. Twelve people have been hospitalized. All of the cases are either employees, contractors or visitors of the mill, officials said. “Although the source of the infection has not been established, we continue to take this matter very seriously and are following recommendations from health and government officials and implementing numerous, proactive steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and visitors,” Peterson said in a statement from the health department. On Thursday, the company announced the “temporary idling” of the Escanaba mill for additional cleaning.

      Meghan Trainor says she’s ‘so sorry’ for her remarks about teachers
    ","Meghan Trainor has apologized for her “careless” remarks about teachers, saying she was “fired up” over the recent school shootings in the United States. The Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter provoked controversy last week when she exclaimed “F**k teachers!” during a discussion about parenthood on her podcast, “Workin’ On It,” which she co-hosts with her brother, Ryan Trainor. “We’re homeschooling our kids. Everyone on TikTok is like, ‘This is what it’s like having kids in America. I have a bulletproof backpack.’ I was like, ‘F**k all that,’” she said during the episode. When guest Trisha Paytas spoke about her negative experiences with educators as well as fears over potential bullies, Trainor added: “F**k teachers, dude.” Teachers were quick to call out Trainor, including TikTok user @GalsGotMoxie, who said she was disappointed by the 29-year-old star’s “mean” and “out of touch take.” On Sunday, the “Australian Idol” judge addressed her comments in a TikTok video, saying her intention was never to disregard the importance of those working in the education system. “Teachers of TikTok and teachers of the world, I recently said ‘F teachers’ on the podcast, and it’s not how I feel,” Trainor said. “I was fired up because we were talking about how sending your kid to school here in America is so horrific. And what all of us have to go through, especially teachers, is not normal and not OK.” Trainor, who is expecting her second child, went on to say that both she and her husband, actor Daryl Sabara, were previously bullied by teachers and that experience played into her comment. She continued: “I did not mean that to all teachers. I love teachers, I fight for teachers. I think they have the hardest job and they are the most underpaid. They are the most unappreciated when they literally raise all of us.

      Jennifer Grey says anxiety stopped her reprising ‘Friends’ role
    ","Jennifer Grey has revealed that “bad anxiety” prevented her from reprising her role in “Friends,” as she opened up about her time on the show. Although she was initially excited, as “a fan of the show,” Grey told website MediaVillage that when it came to shooting her scenes, she “had such bad anxiety because they kept changing the script. “It’s very hard to be a guest star because you’re not a part of it, and you’re really trying to figure it all out,” she added. “They were trying to figure out what the character was, what the scene was, and it was changing, and changing, and changing. It all made me so anxious that I could barely do it.” Grey appeared toward the end of the show’s first season as Mindy, Rachel’s maid of honor and best friend, who had an affair with and eventually married Rachel’s jilted ex, Barry the orthodontist. The role was later recast, with Jana Marie Hupp appearing in the final episode of season two, “The One with Barry and Mindy’s Wedding.” “When they asked me to come back, I said I couldn’t,” Grey said. “They got someone else to play the role. It makes me sad that I would say no to continuing on Friends…because of my anxiety. The truth is, I wished I had people to help me navigate that kind of fear. But I couldn’t be there until I was there.” Grey, best known for her roles in “Dirty Dancing” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” also recalls that anxiety prevented her from pursuing other career opportunities, including hosting “Saturday Night Live.” “I didn’t know at the time what was going on with me,” she said. “But I had a lot of performance anxiety, and I just didn’t understand at that time that I needed help in the anxiety department.” But Grey says she is now able to draw some positives from the experience, adding that “everything you do in life, especially the hard things, the really painful, difficult things, are usually the things that are the most instructive and helpful.” ",347,entertainment,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/entertainment/jennifer-grey-friends-anxiety-intl-scli/index.html

      Ray Romano underwent heart surgery after major blockage
    ","Ray Romano regrets not taking his doctor’s advice years ago. The “Everybody Loves Raymond” star said he recently has a heart stent installed after doctors found a 90 percent blockage in a major artery. “I had high cholesterol 20 years ago and my guy always told me, ‘Why don’t we start going on the statin,’” Romano said during a conversation on the “WTF Podcast with Marc Maron.” “And every time I would say let me do it myself,” he recalled. “I would go home and eat a little healthier, get it down a couple ticks. It was 280 and now its 220. He’d go, ‘You gotta get it down even more.’” The 65-year-old actor said he regrets not going on the medication earlier, though he said he’s now pre-diabetic. “I’m on the meds, and it’s got me all down now, so I figured, ‘Oh, now I can enjoy and eat some food.’” Romano said. “My sugar level’s up now.” The co-writer and director of “Somewhere in Queens” said aging has been quite the experience, telling Maron, “60 is weird man.” “Saying 50 was weird, but saying 60 is sounds foreign, it sounds fake,” Romano said. “In my head I don’t feel that old. In my body I’m getting a couple of notices that I am that old.” “Somewhere in Queens” is out now.

      Matthew Perry is removing controversial mentions of Keanu Reeves from future editions of memoir
    ","The one where Matthew Perry tries to make amends with Keanu Reeves. The “Friends” star appeared at the LA Times Festival of Books on Saturday and during a panel, told the audience that he plans to remove Reeves’ name from future editions of his 2022 memoir “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.” The memoir is a candid telling of Perry’s struggle with substance abuse and addiction, but the actor faced backlash last fall for references to Reeves that some found offensive including in one excerpt about his friend River Phoenix’s 1993 death. “River was a beautiful man, inside and out – too beautiful for this world, it turned out. It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down,” Perry wrote. “Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?” Perry previously apologized for the comment, saying in a statement to People in October 2022 that he’s “a big fan” of Reeves and had just chosen a “random name” in the prose. “I apologize. I should have used my own name instead,” he added in the statement. On Saturday, Perry addressed the Reeves mention once more, this time telling the audience “I said a stupid thing. It was a mean thing to do,” according to the LA Times. “I pulled his name because I live on the same street,” Perry said during the panel, noting that “any future versions of the book will not have his name in it.” While Perry had previously apologized to Reeves, he also mentioned on Saturday that he’s yet to apologize to the “Matrix” star in person. “If I run into the guy, I’ll apologize. It was just stupid,” Perry concluded. ",291,entertainment,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/entertainment/matthew-perry-removes-keanu-reeves-memoir/index.html

      Eric Braeden, Victor Newman on ‘Young and the Restless,’ reveals cancer diagnosis
    ","Eric Braeden, one of the most famous actors in daytime television, is sharing about his cancer diagnosis. The 82-year-old actor, who for decades has portrayed mogul Victor Newman on “The Young and the Restless,” recently opened up about his health in a video on social media. According to Braeden, he began to notice an issue with his prostate while recovering from knee replacement. “I hate to be this personal, but I think this may be good for some older guys who may or may not listen to this,” he said. “It will happen to them.” Braeden said his frequent urge to urinate sent him to a doctor, and he was given a catheter and a plan for a new bladder treatment procedure. But after having the original catheter removed, Braeden said he ended up at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles because he was unable to urinate. The doctor who treated him there, according to Braeden, told him he had learned to speak English after moving to the US from Vietnam by watching him on the soap opera and that the actor had cancer. The surgeon planned to both remove the cancer and perform a UroLift procedure to relieve the pressure on his urethra, Braeden said. “Now some of you may know that one doesn’t really know what kind of cancer it is until they go into it,” Braeden explained. The star said he had low-grade and high-grade cancer cells removed. He is undergoing treatment that incorporates immunotherapy. Braeden said he has already undergone some of the treatments. “I’m ok, really. It’s not that bad,” he said. “Hopefully, it stays that way.” ",271,entertainment,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/entertainment/eric-braeden-cancer/index.html

      ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Game of Thrones’ franchises to get fresh life on newly minted Max streamer
    ","Fantasy freaks and noble nerds unite. Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Wednesday that the ‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘Harry Potter’ franchises will take on new life at the studio’s newly minted streaming service Max. For those who are eager to soar back into the wizarding world of ‘Harry Potter,’ buckle up because the franchise is coming to Max in the form of a scripted television series. (CNN and Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) The series will be a “faithful adaptation” of the beloved “Harry Potter” books by author J.K. Rowling, who will also serve as an executive producer on the project, according to a news release. Rowling’s “Potter” books were published between 1997 and 2007. The television series will feature a cast of fresh new faces to take on the roles made famous in the “Potter” films by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The series is expected to run for an unprecedented 10 years with the promise that each season “will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core.” Over in Westeros, Max will launch a second prequel series in the “Game of Thrones” universe, titled “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight” based on author George R.R. Martin’s 2013 “Dunk and Egg” novellas. The prequel is set a century before the events of the original “Game of Thrones,” which ran from 2011 to 2019, and will center on the wanderings of “two unlikely heroes,” Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg, according to a news release. “Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends,” the release said. The announcement for a new “Thrones” prequel comes after “House of the Dragon” debuted in 2022. “Dragon” is also a prequel series, based on the Targaryen civil war and set nearly 200 years prior to “Game of Thrones.” It’s based on Martin’s “Fire & Blood” book from 2018. Release dates for both new series have not yet been announced. ",386,entertainment,2023-04-12,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/entertainment/harry-potter-game-of-thrones-max/index.html

      Jennifer Garner’s return to TV is much appreciated
    ","Remember when television stars just wanted to break into film? Neither do I, as I am way too young. I kid, I kid. There was a time when TV was viewed as the springboard to the big screen. But now the small screen is no longer so small, and plenty of stars are excited to perform there. Let’s talk about one. Count me as a big fan of Jennifer Garner. Her Instagram account with its “pretend cooking show” and positive videos brought me joy during the height of the pandemic. Garner is in fact beloved since her starring role in the early aughts on “Alias.” Now, she is returning to television in the Apple TV+ limited series, “The Last Thing He Told Me.” Based on the novel of the same name by Laura Dave, the thriller focuses on a woman whose husband disappears, but not before warning her to protect his daughter. Garner plays the mom who is searching for the truth about her husband. Garner also had a role on the “Party Down” revival this year, as the cheerful love interest to Adam Scott’s character Henry. She told AV Club she loved the writing on both of the shows. “I would’ve done anything to play this role,” Garner said of her part in “The Last Thing He Told Me.” “I knew I had the capacity to dive into a role in a way I haven’t in a long time, and I wanted to luxuriate in that process.” Now if we could only get an “Alias” reboot – which is saying something, as longtime readers of this newsletter know I am not big on reboots. “The Last Thing He Told Me” starts streaming Friday. No reveals here, but “Succession” had a really big episode recently. Which brings up the topic of spoilers. In this day and age of social media, how do you avoid them? You could always mute the topic on Twitter, but what happens when you go on Instagram or TikTok or Facebook? It’s not easy to live a spoiler-free life, especially with a buzzy show like “Succession.” Even discussion about the actors clearly being in the running for Emmys spoiled it for some. Personally, I don’t appreciate the pressure I feel to watch something right away or staying off of social media just so it’s all not ruined for me. First world problem, I know. If James Hetfield had his way, Metallica’s new album would not have been named “72 Seasons.” “My vision was I wanted this album [to be] called Lux Æterna because that summed up all the songs for me, kind of an eternal light that was always inside of us that maybe is just now coming out,” the band’s frontman told Loudwire. “And I was outvoted, which is great. 72 Seasons is definitely more chewable.” The heavy metal band’s 11th album has a theme of how our older selves are shaped by our younger selves, which feels appropriate for the group that formed in 1981 and has been rocking hard ever since. “72 Seasons” drops Friday. There are fewer things I love more than Prince and podcasts, and CNN is giving me both. “The Prince Mixtape” will include people who knew Prince, worked with him, or just loved him from afar with host Nichole Perkins digging deeper into the key moments of of the late singer’s life. The world sadly has not been the same since Prince died from an accidental overdose in April of 2016. The new podcast starts streaming on April 19. “American Manhunt: The Boston Marathon Bombing” uses interviews, reenactments and archival footage to tell the story of the 2013 bombing that killed three and injured more than 250 people (a fourth person was killed days later during the manhunt for the bombers). It was an event that held a nation riveted and left it grieving. This “American Manhunt” is streaming on Netflix. We are seeing a lot of Jeremy Renner and I, for one, am grateful for that. Having survived a devastating accident on New Year’s Day, the “Marvel” star now has a new show (filmed prior to his accident). “Rennervations” is a four-part series based on the actor’s “lifelong passion to give back to communities around the world by reimagining unique purpose-built vehicles to meet a community’s needs.” It’s streaming on Disney+ starting Wednesday. Welcome back, Midge. The fifth and final season of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” kicks off with the first three episodes Friday on Prime. This beloved show has taken us on quite the journey and as sad as it is that it’s ending, we know that Rachel Brosnahan as Miriam “Midge” Maisel is going to remind as to why we first fell in love with the show.

      Jane Krakowski explains how she tackled the flying trapeze in ‘Schmigadoon!’
    ","Jane Krakowski says learning how to navigate flying trapeze was just “one of the perks” of joining “Schmigadoon!” The “30 Rock” actress, who plays a lawyer in the town of Schmicago on the Apple TV+ series, is a veteran performer who was comfortable with the singing and dancing scenes in the show. She did, however, acquire new trapeze skills. “It was always written in that when my character performs her big number, which is called Bells and Whistles, which is a number that is meant to mesmerize and mystify the jury to try to get her client off of murder, she pulls out all the stops,” Krakowsi recalled in an interview with CNN. “It was written in that I fly in from the ceiling on a trapeze and then there was no further reference to it. So just being one who loves to add any physical challenge or element to the roles I’m in, I asked if I could stay on the trapeze longer, if I could learn some tricks or things to do on it.” The scene would shoot in just a week, so producers told her to go see what she could learn. After just four lessons at trapeze school, Krakowski said, set designers opened the ceiling a bit further and she was able to “fly all around the entire courtroom.” “It was exhilarating,” she said, adding that she likely won’t keep up the lessons. “I’m not sure where I’m gonna be able to pull out my trapeze,” she laughed. Krakowski, who has worked as an actress for most of her life, made her film debut in “National Lampoon’s Vacation” in 1983. She has starred on Broadway and in soap operas, but is perhaps best known for her role as the insecure yet overinflated Jenna Maroney on “30 Rock.” “I love playing Jenna. She’s one of the great characters of all time,” she said. “I feel so lucky to have worked with the whole team, and in the Tina Fey world, and with all the great actors on that show, too.” From 1997 to 2002, Krakowski also starred in “Ally McBeal,” playing office assistant Elaine Vassal in the series. “I do believe there was recently talk that there was going to be maybe a new generational reboot, I would assume with all new players, not the original cast, but I don’t know anything,” Krakowski said of “McBeal.” As for “Schmigadoon!,” Krakowski said the show is one of her favorite projects to date, blending her love of musical theater and performing live with her love of doing comedy on television. “It’s so intelligently and smartly done,” she said. “Schmigadoon!” currently streams on Apple TV+.

      ‘Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story’ trailer offers deeper look into the monarch’s origin story
    ","The Queen of England is ascending the throne in the official trailer for Netflix’s “Bridgerton” prequel series “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.” India Amarteifio stars as a younger version of Golda Rosheuvel’s sharp-witted Queen Charlotte, to whom viewers were first introduced in 2020 when the Regency-era series “Bridgerton” premiered on the streamer. The new trailer, released on Thursday, opens with Queen Charlotte wondering why King George (Corey Mylchreest), the King of England, and his royal family want her to wed the king in an arranged marriage. “It is time we were united as a society,” Princess Agusta (Michelle Fairley) says to the young queen in the trailer, insisting that she makes “as many babies as possible.” Centering on the young Queen Charlotte’s “rise to prominence and power,” the series follows her journey as her “marriage to King George sparked both a great love story and a societal shift, creating the world of the Ton inherited by the characters in Bridgerton,” according to Netflix. Queen Charlotte is later seen trying to escape the royal grounds by climbing over a wall when she comes face to face with King George himself. “I realize you have no reason to like me,” he later says. “But if you give me one evening of your time, it might make you hate me a little bit less.” Clips of steamy romance scenes, choreographed dance numbers in a grand ballroom, nefarious courtiers and an opulent royal wedding are teased throughout the trailer as Queen Charlotte is seen trying to navigate her new marriage and her place in history. Rosheuvel, Adjoa Andoh and Ruth Gemmell will reprise their “Bridgerton” roles in the series, alongside new characters played by Fairley, Sam Clemmett and Freddie Dennis. “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story” will be available to stream on Netflix on May 4.

      Why Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson have ‘nothing to hide’ on ‘Sibling Revelry’ podcast
    ","To Kate and Oliver Hudson, family is everything. So much so that the siblings started a podcast together in 2019 called “Sibling Revelry,” which has featured over 100 guests and launched a new season on Wednesday. The podcast “explores the sibling bond, family dynamics, the human mind, body, and so much more,” according to the website, and the famous pair’s vulnerable and open approach to embracing their own dynamic as siblings – they are the children of Goldie Hawn and estranged father Bill Hudson – has inspired their many podcast guests to share about the inner workings of their own family and sibling dynamics. “I think we’re both pretty comfortable feeling vulnerable, talking about insecurities,” Kate Hudson told CNN in an interview, adding that “when you can open up with those insecurities or vulnerabilities, it’s actually a strength.” Kate and Oliver Hudson have spoken with everyone from Mary and Stella McCartney, the daughters of Beatles legend Paul McCartney, to Kate Hudson’s “Almost Famous” co-star Billy Crudup and his brothers Tommy and Brooks. In the new season, they speak with Matthew and Rooster McConaughey, CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta and his brother Suneel, and sisters Barbara Bush and Jenna Hager. The conversations on “Sibling Revelry” tend to be joyous, insightful and hilarious, and offer a refreshing take on navigating life with a built-in best friend. Read on to learn more about how the Hudsons’ sibling chemistry led to “Sibling Revelry.” The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. CNN: What is it about your sibling dynamic that lends itself to some of the more revealing conversations that you have had? Oliver Hudson: I think it’s honestly how candid we are, and how open we are with our feelings. I feel like we’re unafraid to sort of talk about our relationship and how we view the things that we’ve been through, and it helps people to open up a little bit. Kate Hudson: Yeah. And vulnerability. I think we’re both pretty comfortable feeling vulnerable, talking about insecurities. When you can open up with those insecurities or vulnerabilities, it’s actually a strength.  And that’s how we grew up, being very open with our feelings. I’ve always felt even outside of our podcast that I’ve got nothing to hide. And then I did our podcast and I realized there definitely is things I’d like to hide. OH: The beauty of podcasts is to say, ‘Well, we’re going to cut that.’ KH: So as open as we are, there are things where I’m like, ‘Oh, we really went a little too far on that one, too revealing.’ OH: But I think most people probably come in with some sort of a guard up, but the minute that they feel comfortable and they see that you are able to tell your truth and not be afraid of it, I think it puts people at ease and allows them to open up a little bit more. KH: And I think that as hard and as challenging as certain things can be in a family dynamic, when you have laughter, if you’re able to have some self humor, if you’re able to be somewhat self deprecating, if you’re able to face your own shortcomings, you can actually have a better sense of humor about them. And that’s something that’s got Oliver and I through a lot, is laughter. And thinking about where the world is right now, I was thinking about this yesterday when starting to do prep for the podcast. Our world is so unpredictable. There’s so much that’s unpredictable right now. And when you really think about what matters, what’s going to keep you feeling good, it kind of really does start at home with your family and with the connections that you have with the people you love. And we have to nurture that. And I think the more we nurture that the better the world becomes. Like the more we nurture our small community that we have, that we all have, I think the better the larger community becomes. OH: And it’s hard too, because sometimes you talk to siblings who have had maybe issues with other siblings, and there’s a division there. But depending on the situation, it’s an important relationship to mend, I think. Because at the end of the day, I tell my kids this when they’re all yelling at each other, I’m like, ‘This is all you got!’ You know what I mean? At the end of the day, this is your tribe, you know? So make sure that you nurture this and understand. CNN: Speaking of kids, have you learned anything from the conversations you’ve had with your guests that have informed you on dynamics you want to apply as parents to your children? KH: Yes. Oh, completely! Also just the different parenting styles that people have experienced where (I’m) like, ‘God that’s great.’ Like, someone who completely came from a completely different sort of parenting style/background. OH: And some of the experts that we bring on too are extremely insightful. Ron Howard pops into my mind. With the way he grew up with his family who have a bunch of actors and it’s, like a whole thing. KH: He’s so great. We had Dr. Shefali on who did a book called “The Conscious Parent.” And that was really insightful. I left that podcast really taking a lot from her about how we actually heal our own wounds as we raise our children, by looking deeper into ourselves and our reactivity towards the things that our children are doing. OH: It’s also about respecting the way that everyone does it because everyone does it differently, even including my sister and I. Kate and I parent differently. KH: Super different. OH: But we respect the way that we do it. And when my kids are with Kate, she does it one way and they come home and they’re like, ‘Auntie Kate did this, this and this…’ And then I’m like, ‘Well, don’t go over there!’ It’s her rules man, if you’re not feeling it, then I don’t know what to do. And then her kids come to my house and I get yelled at by Kate like, ‘What are you doing?!’ CNN: What conversations have you both had with each other and with your guests that have surprised you? OH: There’s a surprise in every show really, honestly. Everyone’s story is so unique. And you may go in there thinking you’re going to hear the same thing over and over again, but that’s just never the case. There’s always something that’s extremely relatable. The overall surprise for me is how this podcast and the decision to do it has brought my sister and I closer together in that we’re more expressive, we’re able to talk about things that you don’t really talk about around a dinner table or in your everyday world. So it sparks a lot of interesting conversation between us and we’re able to even get into it on the air, just about some of the issues that the guests bring up that are relatable to us. So for me, that’s what it is. KH: For me, moving forward, it’s no longer a surprise because now we really understand it. Because by now, we’ve interviewed over I think 100. But it is how perception plays such a part in challenging relationships in the home, that everybody has a different perception of how something happened in their life, or even a circumstance that a sibling can remember in a completely different way. And how that can create conflict or how that informs how you resolve conflict. Now we know there is not one perception of anything. Like we all grow up with a different way of perceiving things. OH: It’s so interesting. It’s based on age and where you are in the pecking order of the siblings status. Taye Diggs, on one of the early ones, he and his brother growing up had completely different perspectives on how they were raised and who their father was to them. Like night and day. It’s really amazing. It’s a good point, you know, just that filter. KH: And in the beginning that really surprised me. And now I’m like, oh, the center of most conflict usually does come down to when people argue about how something was or how something went down versus the overall experience. CNN: How do you prep for your interviews? Do you talk beforehand and decide who’s going to ask questions based on who’s better at a certain topic, or who’s friendlier with the guests that you have? How do you map it all out? OH: It’s actually a good question because, again, it’s a night and day thing. Kate’s got the prep and— KH: My notes, I like to read stuff.

I make hard left and right turns. KH: It’s a really good dynamic actually because Oliver is hilarious and witty and lovable and does make the hard left, hard right. And I usually have fun with it and then bring it back on the road. OH: I think authentically, Kate and I are who we are on this show. It really is, otherwise it would just sound sort of false if it was more structured, I think. She’s got her structure, I’m a little nutty. We sort of see where it takes us. KH: Oliver loves to challenge experts. OH: Yeah. KH: And I’m like, ‘Ollie, they’re an expert. Yeah, you don’t know what you’re talking about.’ CNN: It looks like you have some exciting guests lined up for the season. What or who are you most excited about? KH: I mean, honestly, just being back on the air and our listeners. I’m excited to come back and kind of re-engage with our audience. And we really love our audience, they’re so loyal. Anytime someone comes up to me and they talk about loving the podcast, it always ends in a great conversation about which one they loved and why and their own experience. And I’m really excited about that. We get letters, emails come in that inspire Oliver and I and really move us. OH: Yeah, and I think these episodes and the seasons are a reflection of what we’re interested in too. So when you’re hearing a guest, it’s not just pulling a guest out of thin air. It’s like ooh, we’re into this. We’re into all of the things and all the guests, it’s a reflection of what we want to learn as well.

      Nic Cage’s Dracula was inspired by Anne Bancroft in ‘The Graduate,’ according to Nicholas Hoult
    ","Think Dracula and the cape, the fangs and bloodlust come to mind. On screen, perhaps the image of Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee or Gary Oldman. Nic Cage thought Dracula and saw Anne Bancroft in “The Graduate.” That’s according to Nicholas Hoult, who plays the titular servant to Dracula in “Renfield,” a new take on Bram Stoker’s characters. Bancroft’s turn as Mrs. Robinson, a mother seducing her daughter’s boyfriend in Mike Nichols’ iconic 1967 film, is not the most obvious inspiration for the vampire aristocrat, but then Cage is not an obvious actor. “I don’t think it gets more iconic than Nic Cage playing Dracula,” Hoult told CNN. “He’s having so much fun with the role, bringing so much inspiration from previous movies, from the book, but also from unexpected places like ‘The Graduate’ and Anne Bancroft.” “It was a true joy for me to be in those scenes and those moments,” he added, “because I just picked up on that energy and tried to run with it.” Set in New Orleans in the present day, “Renfield” reinterprets Dracula and Renfield’s vampire-familiar bond as a toxic relationship from which Hoult’s character is trying to escape, enrolling in a self-help group. “When we first meet him in this movie he’s worked for about 100 years for Dracula, who is the most narcissistic, horrendous boss imaginable,” Hoult explained. “I thought this was just such an original, new, fresh take,” he added. “The story around that destructive relationship and how they work together I thought was a very fun idea.” Cage’s operatic take on the Count isn’t even his most outrageous performance as a bloodsucker (that would be his iconic turn in “Vampire’s Kiss”) but it’s hard to forget. Dracula is a character that requires an actor to go big or go home – and with good reason. With over 100 Dracula films to date, it takes a lot to cut through the noise. Why then is he a character filmmakers and audiences keep coming back to? “Nic Cage describes this idea of love in exile, and Dracula being someone who’s in extreme pain, because he has to watch everyone that he loves die,” said Hoult. “So, he’s quite a lonely character. I think there’s something quite romantic about the tale, in some ways.” “Renfield” is released in US and UK cinemas on April 14.

      ‘Live with Kelly and Ryan’ says goodbye to Ryan Seacrest
    ","Ryan Seacrest said goodbye to “Live with Kelly and Ryan” after six seasons on Friday. After his last time walking on the stage as co-host with Kelly Ripa, Seacrest said he was going to get emotional. “Kelly turned the corner and said, ‘Oh my gosh, am I going to cry?’ And I said, ‘Maybe, because I am’” Seacrest said on the show. As both teared up, Ripa said, “We promised ourselves backstage that we would not do this because it is a great day of celebration around here.” First Lady Jill Biden was a guest for Ryan’s final day, which also featured a look back on Seacrest hosting over the years. Seacrest’s family was in attendance and Michael Bublé sent a special video message. The show had been previously recorded, according to a disclaimer that appeared on screen. Seacrest had announced in February that he would be leaving in order to focus on “American Idol” and multiple other projects. He says he plans to visit “Live” occasionally. “Working alongside Kelly over the past six years has been a dream job and one of the highlights of my career,” Seacrest said at the time. “She has been an amazing partner, friend, and confidant, and although we will always be a part of each other’s lives, I will miss our mornings together.” ",220,entertainment,2023-04-14,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/ryan-seacrest-leaving-live/index.html

      Jason Sudeikis explains why he keeps his Twitter DMs open (yes, he seriously does)
    ","Believe that when “Ted Lasso” star Jason Sudeikis says he read his Twitter DMs, he really does. In a new interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper that aired on Friday, Sudeikis, who stars as the titular character of the Apple TV+ feel-good comedy series, said his Twitter DMs are wide open for a good reason. “You try to spend as much time and be as present with people,” Sudeikis said of the show’s loyal viewers. “I read everybody’s messages.” He added that because of the themes of the show, the cast has been met “with such kindness and grace” from viewers. Sudeikis said that he keeps his DMs open because the stories that people share with him are “incredibly moving.” “People share their stories or explain where they’ve held the ‘Believe’ poster, where they have it. Like, in a parent’s hospital room or in classrooms or where-have-you,” he said. Optimism, mental health and simply just being kind to one another are just a few of the themes that “Ted Lasso” has tackled. And perhaps the biggest overarching theme, illustrated by a bright yellow poster that hangs in AFC Richmond’s lively locker room, is to just “Believe” that anything is possible. Sudeikis’s inbox is likely full of an unimaginable amount of messages, but he says that he puts forth a real effort to read what he can. “I want ‘em to know that, sincerely, that they’re seen, they’re heard, they’re read,” he said, going on to add that the sentiments from viewers that he and those involved in the show read aren’t something they “take lightly or take for granted.” “Ted Lasso” is set in the UK and follows an American football coach who jumps the pond to coach AFC Richmond, the struggling English Premier League soccer team. The series’ third season, which could be its last, began streaming in March and is chock full of feel-good moments, moving subplots and, of course, biscuits. The critically acclaimed show became an instant classic when it premiered in 2020 and has since won 11 Emmy Awards, including consecutive best comedy series wins in 2021 and 2022.

      Sifan Hassan lays claim to being greatest female distance runner with thrilling London Marathon victory
    ","Running is a simple sport, the art of putting one foot in front of the other faster than your other competitors. That’s precisely what Sifan Hassan did in the London Marathon on Sunday, though her stunning, chaotic victory in the women’s race was anything but straightforward. “There were so many dramas,” Hassan told reporters after the race, “so many dramas – but it’s beautiful.” A three-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champion on the track, the win in London, one of the world’s six marathon majors, is the latest addition to the Dutch athlete’s remarkable running CV. Hassan spent much of her debut marathon wondering when she would drop out having stopped to stretch an injured hip just after the hour mark. She later said she had forgotten to tape up her leg before taking to the start line. Incredibly, Hassan appeared to shake off the injury and even picked up her pace as she gained on the lead group. She had made up the lost ground by the closing stages, narrowly avoiding further disaster when she swerved towards a motorbike to collect her bottle from a drinks station. Apparently unshaken by the near miss, Hassan recovered and had enough energy to outsprint Ethiopia’s Alemu Megertu and Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir, the Olympic marathon champion, in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, breaking the finish tape in two hours, 18 minutes, and 34 seconds. Not many athletes are able to replicate their success on the track over the 26.2 miles of the marathon, let alone at the first time of asking. But Hassan, who won 5,000 and 10,000-meter golds at the Tokyo Olympics and a bronze in the 1,500 meters, is no ordinary athlete, such is her talent over a range of distances. She later downplayed the suggestion that she is the greatest female distance runner of all time. “I’m not the greatest, I’m just okay,” the 30-year-old said. “I don’t need to become the greatest. I’m fine the way I am.” Consider her buildup for Sunday’s race and Hassan’s victory is even less believable. She said she hadn’t done much marathon-specific training as she was fasting for Ramadan and therefore unable to fuel and hydrate sufficiently for long runs. Rather than making a long-term commitment to the marathon, Hassan thought she would test herself over the longer distance and still race on the track this summer. It was a decision she started to regret on the morning of the race. “I was telling myself that I’m stupid that I decided to run the marathon,” said Hassan. “I even cried, [thinking]: why have I decided to run the marathon? “I was so scared. This morning, I was telling Tim [Rowberry], my coach, ‘Why did I decide to run the marathon? What is wrong with me?” It wasn’t until she crossed the finish line that she finally believed she would win the race. What kept her going, Hassan said, was finding the “spirit” to fuel herself for her next marathon. “It was not 100% I’m going to finish – it did not come into my mind,” she added. The Ethiopian-born Hassan, who moved to Netherlands as a refugee aged 15, ranked her victory in a rain-soaked London on par with her three medals at the Tokyo Olympics. Prior to that, she broke the 23-year-old mile world record at the start of 2019 and won 1,500 and 10,000-meter golds at the world championships a few months later. Her marathon debut set the tone for another thrilling performance in the men’s elite race as Kenya’s Kelvin Kiptum set a course record of two hours, one minute and 25 seconds – the second-fastest marathon time ever behind Eliud Kipchoge’s world record from last year’s Berlin Marathon. The 23-year-old Kiptum, who ran the fastest-ever debut marathon in Valencia last year, finished nearly three minutes ahead of compatriot Geoffrey Kamworor in second, while Ethiopia’s Tamirat Tola was a further 36 seconds back in third. “I am so happy with the result,” Kiptum told the BBC, according to Reuters. “I don’t know what to say right now, I am just grateful.” ",682,sport,2023-04-24,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/sport/sifan-hassan-london-marathon-spt-intl/index.html

      NBA playoffs: Golden State Warriors edge past the Sacramento Kings despite botched timeout to level series
    ","The Golden State Warriors narrowly beat the Sacramento Kings in a playoff thriller, winning 126-125 to level the first round series at 2-2. Former Warrior Harrison Barnes, who played a key role in Golden State’s 2015 title run, missed a game-winning buzzer beater that would have given Sacramento a commanding series lead. Warriors star guard Stephen Curry will have been more relieved than most to see Barnes’ three-point effort rim out. With Golden State up five with just 45 seconds remaining, Curry called for a timeout without realizing his team was out of them, resulting in a technical foul and possession being given back to the Kings. Malik Monk made the free throw for the technical foul and then Sacramento star De’Aaron Fox, who has earned a reputation this year for big buckets at crucial moments, hit a three-pointer to narrow the gap to just one. Curry then missed his next effort and gave Barnes the chance to win the game, but the 30-year-old’s shot was just long, sparking jubilant scenes inside the Chase Center. “I ain’t gonna lie, I thought it was the smartest play in the world,” Curry said after the game, per the NBA. “When I grabbed the ball and turned around and saw the trap, realized there was no real outlets instead of turning it over, it’s kind of the heady play, but it turned out not to be. “I looked over at the bench and everyone was shaking their head, so it was an unfortunate situation in that respect. Thankfully, we came away with the win but good learning lesson on how important all those details are. “We know it but knowing timeouts, knowing the situation, it was just an unfortunate sequence right there.” But Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he took responsibility for not making the situation clearer to Curry. “We took the challenge and when the challenge was unsuccessful, as we were exiting the huddle, it’s on me,” Kerr said. “I’ve got to remind the guys, we’re out of timeouts and I didn’t say that, and so Steph wasn’t aware. That’s on me for not making that clear.” Curry led scoring for the Warriors with 32 points and was helped out by Klay Thompson’s 26 and Jordan Poole’s 22. At the other end, Fox scored a game-high 38 points to go with nine rebounds and five assists and was backed up by rookie Keegan Murray, who scored 23 points and grabbed seven rebounds. The Kings perhaps still hold a slight advantage as the series returns to Sacramento on Wednesday for Game 5. Golden State, despite boasting one of the best home records in the league this season, had one of the worst away records and has struggled on the road all year. This young Kings team has also expertly dealt with the pressure of playing in the franchise’s first playoff series in 16 seasons and will be rightly confident it can retake the lead on Wednesday.

      Radio DJ Adele Roberts breaks record for fastest woman with an ileostomy to run the London Marathon
    ","British radio presenter Adele Roberts became the fastest woman to complete the London Marathon with an ileostomy, running the distance in just over three and a half hours on Sunday. The Guinness World Records awarded Roberts with a framed certificate at the finish line, writing on Twitter: “Adele Roberts completed the fastest marathon with an ileostomy (female) in 3:30:22. Congratulations, Adele!” Roberts, who is known for working on BBC Radio 1 in the UK, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2021 and began using a stoma bag after undergoing surgery 18 months ago. The 44-year-old only stopped chemotherapy less than 12 months ago but recovered in time to set a new record. “Thank you to every single person who has helped make today possible,” Roberts wrote on Instagram after the race. “For those warriors living with cancer, for all the incredible ostomates around the UK and for the heroes of the NHS. That was for you.” An ileostomy is a procedure to create an opening to bring the end of the small bowel through an opening in the abdomen. The opening can be temporary or permanent. A disposable bag is then worn over the ileostomy to collect stool, rather than it passing out of the rectum. “This means I currently have no use of my large colon,” Roberts wrote on her fundraising page. “Turns out colons are quite handy for hydration and food and running marathons.” It usually takes six to eight weeks to recover from an ileostomy but people should avoid strenuous activity for three months, according to NHS. After the race, Roberts posted a video on Instagram of her presenting her ileostomy – which she has named Audrey – with a tiny replicable finishers medal. Roberts was one of thousands of runners to complete the London Marathon on Sunday which raised millions for charitable causes. Dutch runner Sifan Hassan and Kenya’s Kelvin Kiptum won the women’s and men’s elite races respectively.

      Chevron Championship: Lilia Vu channels memory of late Grandfather to clinch first major title
    ","Lilia Vu triumphed at the Chevron Championship on Sunday, besting American compatriot Angel Yin in a playoff to seal the first major of her career in The Woodlands, Texas. Vu had begun the final round four shots adrift of co-leader Yin but rallied with five birdies – including two to close – to tie the world No. 172 at 10-under and force a playoff. On the first replay of the 18th hole, the 25-year-old curled home a winding birdie putt to clinch victory after Yin’s second shot had splashed into the water. Shortly after, it was Vu’s turn to find the water. Leaping into Poppie’s Pond had been a long-running tradition for champions at Mission Hills in California, host of the major from its inception until its relocation to Carlton Woods for 2023. Vu wasted no time in renewing the ritual, diving into the lake beside the 18th green to toast her second LPGA Tour victory and a winner’s check of $765,000, the largest of her career. Having almost walked away from the sport following early struggles as a pro, it crowned a cathartic victory for the world No. 12. “Everything happens for a reason,” Vu told reporters. “All the bad things, everything I’ve ever struggled through, family-wise, internally, I think myself as the biggest obstacle, I had a pretty tough, not easy past two days. “I was definitely my own enemy, and I don’t know how I pulled this out. I’m just really happy and proud of Cole [caddie] and I for doing this.” Despite a decorated amateur career, Vu endured a grueling start to life on the LPGA Tour, making the cut just once in her first nine starts after turning professional in early 2019. She would not play another LPGA event until 2022, by which point she had lost a formative figure in her life. Vu’s grandfather, who had fled his native Vietnam with her mother, had died in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Amid bubbling frustrations during a wet and windy final round, it was the memory of her grandfather that kept Vu grounded. “I was just in such a bad place with my golf game. Everything was life or death,” Vu said. “I just saw everybody that I’ve competed with being successful, and I just compared myself all the time. “But now I know that everybody’s journey is different, and everything happens for a reason … Even today, I was getting really upset on the course, and I just had to remind me, like, ‘Grandpa is with you, and he’d be really disappointed if you were getting upset like this and that you didn’t get your act together.’ “I think he’d say that all my struggles were worth it,” she added. Runner-up Yin was upbeat despite agonizingly missing out on a first career major. The 24-year-old, runner-up at the US Open in 2019, had looked poised for victory before back-to-back birdies at the 16th and 17th holes opened the door for Vu. A pressure birdie at the final hole to force the playoff signaled a strong response, but Yin’s fightback was ultimately sunk by her subsequent shot into the water. “I didn’t really feel much nerves at all this week, even coming into this stretch,” Yin told reporters. “My caddie was telling me to calm down, but other than that, I really just wasn’t really feeling much. I’m just really mellow. That’s why this lack of emotion, and I’m not crying. “I’m just really happy with who I am, where I am and what I’m doing right now … If I can talk about how much I appreciate life right now, I’ll get emotional, not over this,” she added. World No. 2 Nelly Korda finished one stroke short of making the playoff in third, with Thailand’s Atthaya Thitikul headlining the group of five players that finished tied for fourth at eight-under par. Meanwhile, Jennifer Kupcho endured a grim attempt to defend her title, shooting six-over par to miss the cut and finish tied for 108th. The women’s golf major calendar continues with the US Open at Pebble Beach in California on June 6.

      Drew Maggi: Career minor leaguer finally gets MLB call-up after 13-year wait
    ","They say good things come to those who wait, and Drew Maggi has been waiting a long time for his major league call-up. The third baseman for the Altoona Curve – the Pittsburgh Pirates’ AAA affiliate – was drafted by the Pirates in the 15th round of the 2010 MLB draft but never played a big league game. The 33-year-old then went on a tour of various AAA and AA teams across the US before eventually returning to Pittsburgh in 2022 and re-signing in 2023. Understandably, Maggi was pumped after spending his entire 13-year career in the minor leagues and celebrated alongside his teammates upon receiving the news. Speaking to MLB.com, Maggi touched on the emotions behind the call-up. “This is where it all started for me. This whole year has been a big flashback of my younger self. I’m really happy with how it all turned out,” said Maggi. “I know that 13 years is really hard. There were a lot of ups and downs, a lot of different people, injuries, a lot of stuff happens. You never know when your days are numbered. So, being here, it feels right.” Pittsburgh Pirates manager Derek Shelton seemed equally as moved by Maggi’s promotion. The pair were first acquainted during Maggi’s stint in Minnesota with Shelton as the Twins’ bench coach. The 52-year-old said: “To see him walk into a major-league clubhouse, it’s cool. “Being able to give him a hug this morning, yeah, it was like being able to do something with one of your kids.” The Pirates, who currently lead the NL Central, are riding MLB’s longest win streak with seven consecutive victories and Maggi was there to enjoy some of this success. “I’m just here to be a small part in the winning mindset that’s going on around here,” Maggi explained. “So, if my name is called, I’m ready to go. I’ve been waiting 13 years to see that first pitch. I’ll be ready. No telling when Maggi might get into a game, or if he will still be on the roster, but the Pirates’ next matchup is against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday.

      Barcelona scrapes by Atlético Madrid 1-0 to remain in firm control of La Liga title race
    ","FC Barcelona scraped by Atlético Madrid 1-0 at the Camp Nou to extend its lead at the top of La Liga over eternal rival Real Madrid to 11 points. Ferrán Torres’ goal in the 44th minute made the difference, ensuring Atlético continued its 17-year winless drought – with 8 draws and 15 losses – at the Camp Nou. While the Blaugrana were still missing Ousmane Dembélé, Sergi Roberto and Andreas Christensen, the return of Frenkie de Jong from a hamstring strain strengthened Barça manager Xavi’s squad ahead of what was expected to be a stern test on a warm, sunny afternoon in northeastern Spain. After his team’s 0-0 draw with Getafe in Madrid, Xavi said his team played poorly because it was “accustomed to playing without sun.” After being derided on social media throughout the week, the Barça legend doubled down on Friday ahead of the match, saying, “Even if they make a bunch of memes about me, the sun bothers me … I’m not going to stop (complaining).” The sunny conditions did indeed seem to be getting the better of Barça as Atlético bolted right out of the gate with Antoine Griezmann hitting the crossbar with an effort not even a minute into the match, but the ball was just centimeters too high to bounce into Marc-André ter Stegen’s net. Barça’s first real threat of the match came in the 24th minute as Robert Lewandowski played the ball through to Torres, whose dangerous cross was fortuitously deflected by Atleti keeper Jan Oblak out of the danger zone. In the 35th minute, the Colchoneros again seemed to be gaining control of the match as the ball dropped to Griezmann whose great shot on the half-turn was brilliantly saved by ter Stegen to keep the scoreline level. Just when Barça’s domination of possession in the first half seemed to be fruitless, the first goal materialized near the stroke of half-time. Raphinha passed the ball back into the middle of the pitch to an unmarked Torres at the top of the area, who took his time before finishing past Oblak to score Barcelona’s first goal in 334 minutes since its 4-0 victory over Elche on April 1. But Atlético didn’t back down and pushed for an equalizer after the half-time break; Yannick Carrasco had his curving shot, which was heading towards goal, tipped over the bar in the 54th minute. Barcelona seemed to turn its game up another notch when star midfielder Pedri made his long-awaited return from injury in the 60th minute, giving the Blaugrana a more fluid and creative attack. Raphinha missed a sitter in the 72nd minute after Lewandowski teed him up with a brilliant cross, which almost came to haunt Barcelona as Ter Stegen was forced to make another brilliant save just one minute later to deny Griezmann’s back heel effort off a good Álvaro Morata cross into the box. READ: Vinícius Jr. is being racially abused during LaLiga matches. Why is nobody being punished? Atlético players clamored for a penalty in the 91st minute after a headed ball was deflected off Sergio Busquets’ arm in the area, but the video assistant referee refused to review the play. A flurry of Barça fouls allowed several Atleti attacks in the final minutes of time added on, but the Colchoneros couldn’t make the most of the opportunities. Oblak told reporters after the match that the wasted chances left the team ruing an otherwise a solid performance. “The feelings we get aren’t the best. In the first half, we didn’t play badly, we were pretty good and they scored one in the last minute,” Oblak said. “In the second half, there were chances, but the feeling we have aren’t the best. We lost and we can’t say much more than that.” “The team worked really hard, the crowd supported us and we won,” goalscorer Torres told reporters after the match. “The win gives us a lot of confidence. Atlético was on a good run of form and it’s important for us to have won this match.” The win means Barcelona remains in firm control in the La Liga title race with eight matches remaining and an 11-point lead ahead of Real Madrid. After the match, Pedri told reporters that Barça has “eight finals left” and that the Blaugrana “have to go match by match,” with Xavi adding that it was an important win towards securing the title against a strong team. “We normally don’t concede very much, but Atlético is on an extraordinary run of form lately and that shows you the state of our team. It’s a crucial victory for us,” the manager said. ",774,football,2023-04-23,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/football/barcelona-atletico-madrid-la-liga-spt-intl/index.html

      Mikaela Shiffrin: Record-breaking skier thought Lindsey Vonn would beat Ingmar Stenmark’s landmark first
    ","US skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin hadn’t anticipated moving into the greatest-of-all-time conversation. Instead, the record-breaking skier thought that fellow American Lindsey Vonn would have been the athlete to challenge Ingemar Stenmark’s landmark of 86 World Cup wins. “Lindsey was the one who got the closest and that we all thought was going to break it, and I never considered myself as part of a threat to that record,” Shiffrin said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. Shiffrin broke the overall World Cup wins record – that had been set 34 years ago by skiing legend Stenmark – earlier this month after winning the slalom in Åre, Sweden. That was the same resort where she triumphed in her first ever World Cup race back in December 2012. The 28-year-old American is now the sport’s all-time winningest athlete, male or female – after earlier surpassing Vonn for the most all-time wins by a woman in January. Shiffrin’s compatriot, who reached 83 World Cup wins and was the women’s record holder before Shiffrin overtook her, tweeted, “Congrats!! Dominating,” after the skier drew level with Stenmark. Shiffrin’s partner and Norwegian skier Aleksander Aamodt Kilde also praised the Colorado native for her achievement. Speaking to CNN’s Coy Wire earlier this month, the men’s Alpine Ski World Cup downhill winner said: “She is the goat in the skiing world but she is also the goat in relationships – so for me it is amazing.” The 30-year-old Norwegian added: “I am just lucky to be able to share my experiences with her and I think she’s feeling the same and it makes it easier for us to be calm in the process and understanding each other’s way of handling different situations.” Speaking on her season, Shiffrin reflected: “I did not expect that I would be resetting the all-time wins record, honestly, in my career, let alone this season. “It’s not that it’s a surprise, it’s just I feel like I was never supposed to be there.” Instead, Shiffrin explained that her original goal was to win the overall World Cup title this season – which she did – and to win just five races – she ended up winning 14. Speaking after she won her 87th World Cup race, the two-time Olympic gold medalist said: “Pretty hard to comprehend. My brother and sister-in-law are here. I didn’t know they were coming so that makes it so special.” Shiffrin added: “To the whole team and all the people who have helped me this whole season and whole career, all these people reaching out now after all these years, it’s pretty incredible. I just want to say thank you for that.” Breaking Stenmark’s record capped off a remarkable season for Shiffrin given that she did not pick up a single medal from five races at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and failed to finish in three of them. On Sunday, Shiffrin capped off her Alpine Ski season with a record-extending 88th World Cup victory, 21st giant slalom win, and 138th podium appearance. With Sunday’s appearance on the podium, Shiffrin passed Vonn’s women’s podium record, and left her 17 behind Swedish skiing legend Ingemar Stenmark’s all-time mark of 155 podiums The American’s remarkable season also saw her top skiing’s prize money standings – for both men and women – with Shiffrin earning $1.05 million.

    ","Exploring the peaks of the world’s highest mountains or the secrets of space’s deepest labyrinths has become almost second nature for Poorna Malavath and Kavya Manyapu. It has taken Manyapu to NASA where her research has included designing space suits, and Malavath to the top of Mount Everest when in 2014, she became the youngest ever woman to summit the world’s highest mountain at just 13 years old. Now, these two women have channeled their exploring spirit into climbing some of the world’s most difficult mountains as part of their campaign, Project Shakthi, which raises money to fund girls’ education. At the end of August, they climbed a 6,012m virgin peak in Ladakh, India – one previously unmapped and untouched by human expeditions – aiming to use the symbolism of blazing a trail both literally and metaphorically. Never climbed before, the mountain presented difficult challenges for even an experienced mountaineer like Malavath, for there were neither trails to follow nor advice from previous climbers to cling to. “We have to prepare ourselves mentally to accept everything,” Malavath explains to CNN Sport. “So it is completely different and it has given me so much more knowledge to guide others.” Rainy weather conditions that turned to snow at high altitude added to the complexities of climbing a virgin peak. “The night when we were planning to leave for our summit bit, it actually snowed at our high camp, which meant avalanche conditions on the mountain we wanted to climb that day,” Manyapu recalls to CNN. “We had to rapidly come back as a team, make a safety call and then prepare for the next day. So it was very challenging.” And for a relatively inexperienced climber like Manyapu, though she had trained extensively, the challenges were even greater. “Poorna and I several times when we were in the tent, we would talk about: ‘What if, you know, we won’t be able to make it to the summit, you know, what if this? What if that?’” Manyapu says. “But then we would always like go back and encourage each other and motivate each other that, you know, let’s just take it one step at a time.” In the group’s darkest moments on the trek, they found motivation in Project Shakthi’s purpose and its tagline: ‘We climb so that girls can read,’ a deeply personal cause for both Malavath and Manyapu. Reflecting during the Covid-19 pandemic on her own childhood during which her family moved from India to the United States “to help fulfill her dreams,” Manyapu realized that she could help girls without the same support system to also access opportunities. “I have a three-year-old daughter, so when I look at her, I feel like it’s my responsibility to make the world at least one percent better for her and her generation,” she adds. Manyapu comes from the same village in India as Malavath, but the two women met for the first time in 2019, when Manyapu was pregnant with her daughter. “I’ve always been inspired by [Malavath’s] story since 2014,” Manyapu says. “I called her up and I said this is something I want to start an initiative where we could climb for a cause. “We’ve done things for our passion so far, but how about taking our passion to serve a purpose of empowering, educating and elevating underprivileged school children?” When Malavath embarked on her climb up Mount Everest as a 13-year-old, she was unaware about the problems of inequality which rack society. “As I continued climbing the seven continents’ highest mountains, I came to know about that society,” she says. “And there are many girls who are struggling in rural areas and they aren’t getting any kind of opportunities. “I always think about the students who are studying with me and the people who are in the villages… One of my friends got married at like 14 or 15 years, and now she has two kids and they are going to school. And I just finished my education.” On that climb up Everest, Malavath recalls vomiting from the exertion, remaining stuck on the expedition for “like 50 days because of weather” and being determined to summit the mountain. “When I got an opportunity to climb Mount Everest, it was a different aim to prove that girls can do anything,” she says. “Then after that, I became a mountain lover maybe because mountains have taught me so much.” As well as raising money for education, the project will aim to change the mindset about what women can accomplish and elevate stories that can serve as role models. As part of this, Project Shakthi will partner with the US-based AVS Academy to pair student volunteers with girls sponsored by the organization so that they can receive one-on-one mentorship. “I think we both together bring a story that really would help them see that what a person can do, what a girl can do,” Manyapu says. “Because I believe representation matters. And while we are at a generation where we do see women in various fields, we still have a lot of gender gap to close.” Since August 2009, when the Indian parliament passed the landmark Right to Education Act that made education free and compulsory for all children under 14, the number of girls in school has increased, though the national averages obscure variations across the states, according to the country’s Annual Status of Education Report. Around the world, while enrollment rates are almost equal between genders, the completion rates are still disparate – according to the World Bank, only 36% of girls complete lower secondary school compared to 44% of boys in what it calls low-income countries. And to tackle this global issue, Project Shakthi has set its sights on broadening its goals. Manyapu and Malavath will climb Mount Aconcagua, the highest mountain in South America at 6,961 meters, in December as part of the next phase of Project Shakthi, inviting people interested in climbing to join them. In the meantime, the project has already begun selecting girls who will receive its sponsorship through the $12,000 it has raised so far. “Poorna and I actually visited our village back in India right after we completed our expedition of the virgin peak,” Manyapu says. “And we are starting in our village because that’s where our roots are.” Eventually, the project will aim to sponsor girls across the globe, empowering them and exposing them to opportunities that would otherwise remain hidden, as Malavath and Manyapu continue their mission so that girls can have an education.

      8-year-old boy becomes youngest person to climb California’s El Capitan
    ","An 8-year-old boy became the youngest person to finish climbing El Capitan in California’s Yosemite National Park on Friday, according to his father, who has been by his side and cheering him on since the pair began their journey earlier this week. Sam Adventure Baker achieved the feat Friday evening, his father said in a Facebook post. “What an amazing week! I’m so proud of Sam,” Joe Baker wrote in the post. “He completed the youngest rope ascent of ElCap!” The duo have been scaling the rock since Tuesday as part of a four-person team, where one person climbs ahead of the crew and sets the ropes for others to follow. Earlier Friday, the pair told CNN they would hang a banner on their way up that says, “I love you, Mom, almost there.” Rock climbing has long been a part of the family’s activities – Sam was “in a harness before he could walk,” his father said, adding that his wife is also in love with the sport. Sam’s mother, Ann Baker, told CNN they’ve been supportive of Sam’s adventures. “He seems really happy to be up there and spirits are high,” she said. After resting in a double sleeping bag, Joe and Sam will put in an eight-mile hike Saturday away from the face of El Capitan, according to the Facebook post. “We will be in afterglow for days,” Joe said. El Capitan stands at more than 3,000 feet from valley ground, according to the Yosemite National Park website. And throughout the four-day climb, Joe expected his son would cry “because it’s hard. It’s emotional, but he has been so tough and worked through all of it.” Sam’s bravery is hardly a surprise. The young boy has been training take on the historical feat for at least 18 months, his father said. The pair had also climbed Moonlight Buttress in Utah’s Zion National Park, which reassured his father that Sam was ready for El Capitan. “He did terrific on it and really showed us that he could handle the exposure,” Joe said.

      Meet three Black climbers taking representation to new heights on summits across Africa and around the world
    ","Andrew Alexander King will never forget the first time he took on Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s tallest peak and the world’s largest freestanding mountain, in 2018. But it wasn’t the summit that surprised the climber. It was the greeting he received when he came down, as local mountain guides gathered around him in a celebratory dance. “It turns out they were excited because they’d never seen an African American climb,” he tells CNN. “And I was kind of just blown away by that.” According to the American Alpine Club’s inaugural 2019 State of Climbing report only 1% of surveyed climbers identified as Black. “No one should be surprised to hear that climbing is dominated by White men,” outdoor guide and author James Edward Mills wrote in the forward of the report; of the club members surveyed, 85% were White and 72% male. While this is a US-based poll, and the first of its kind, the lack of non-White climbers is seen and felt worldwide – from Mt. Kilimanjaro to Mt. Everest. CNN recently spoke with King and two other Black climbers on what it will take to make the sport more diverse and inclusive across Africa and beyond. Saray N’kusi Khumalo - CEO, Summits with a Purpose Near-death accidents and summit failures have not slowed down mountaineer Saray N’kusi Khumalo. The Zambian-born mother of two holds a corporate job, hosts a podcast, has climbed some of the tallest mountains around the world – and still has the time to run a non-profit that focuses on education in Africa. “My grandfather always used to say, ‘if you don’t live a life of service, that’s a life wasted,’” she tells CNN. In 2013, she founded Summits with a Purpose in South Africa – with every climb, she raises funds to help build schools and libraries. Khumalo’s climbs are also making a difference in the name of diversity. After she successfully completed her first big summit in 2012 – Mt. Kilimanjaro – Khumalo knew she was meant to be a mountaineer. And while she took note of the lack of diversity in her sport – “very much White-male-dominated,” she says – she never let that discourage her. “I am an African, a very proud African when I’m on the mountain. And I’m told that the (other climbers) don’t think that I belong,” Khumalo says. “I make sure that (when) they see an African, somebody that looks like me, they remember that we are capable.” Not long after her first-ever summit, she turned her eyes toward the world’s tallest peak: Mt. Everest, located in the Himalayas. The first three attempts were grueling and heartbreaking for Khumalo: she experienced everything from natural disasters to losing consciousness in the “death zone,” Everest’s top stretch over 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) above sea level, where oxygen is dangerously low. On May 16, 2019 – her fourth bid – she succeeded, becoming the first Black African woman to reach the summit. In total, only eight of the 4,000 people who’ve ever summited Everest are Black. “I have a love/hate relationsship with Everest,” Khumalo recounts. “I don’t know if it was my greatest achievement more than just getting myself up every time I fell.” She’s currently working on completing the Explorers Grand Slam, the quest to summit the seven highest mountains in the world and reach both the North and South Poles. To date, she has accomplished five of the summits. Khumalo is humbled by what she’s achieved so far, but she notes, “I don’t think that I’ve broken those stereotypes yet; there’s still a lot more work to be done,” adding that representation should extend beyond the mountain tops, too. “It’s not just about Everest; representation … is a gift that we need to leave for the next generation wherever we are,” she says, calling on her peers to step outside their comfort zone to show that Black people belong in all spaces. Andrew Alexander King - CEO, The Between Worlds Project Andrew Alexander King says the first mountain he ever climbed was getting out of the projects in Detroit, Michigan. Today, the avid explorer says he’s climbed over 66 mountains. His long term goal is to climb the 14 highest mountain and volcano peaks on each continent. If he accomplishes this, he’ll be the first Black man to do so. But that’s not his motivation. “If an individual does not see themselves at the top of Everest, at the top of Kilimanjaro … they will not pursue that because they will feel that subconsciously they do not belong,” he says. When King began climbing more seriously in his twenties, he says, “the lack of diversity was very pronounced” and he had a heightened awareness of being the only Black person on the mountain. While climbing Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in South America, he says he was the only Black person on the expedition team – despite it being a diverse group. “There (were) a lot of racial jokes and tension and I had to stand up for myself,” he recalls, adding that people assumed he didn’t have the aptitude for handling a tough climb. “It did make me feel insecure, but I also use that insecurity as my rocket fuel to keep moving forward to break through that glass ceiling,” King says. Seven years ago he founded The Between Worlds Project, which aims to help the communities where he climbs. With each expedition he goes on, he works with local non-profits on issues they are facing such as sexism, racism, climate change and inequality. When CNN spoke with King, he was on his way back home from a two-month trip in Tanzania and Kenya where he had been volunteering in an orphanage, working with the Moving Mountains Trust and climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya alongside locals. “The seeds that we’re planting are going to grow – I will probably not see it in my lifetime, but we have to start planting it and nurturing it now,” King says of increasing representation. “Diversity in outdoor sports is an issue that we have to tackle together.” Peter Naituli - Rock climber Peter Naituli is a Kenyan rock climber known for scaling mountains in his bare feet. Without experienced climbers to guide him when he was growing up, he said he dove right into the riskier aspects of climbing – including free-soloing, which is climbing without a safety system. Through his remarkable physical feats, like climbing Mount Kenya without a rope or footwear, Naituli is proving Kenya’s place in the climbing world. “(As a kid) one thing that was a bit boring in my climbing is I didn’t have anyone else sharing the passion with,” he tells CNN. “It was just me trying to keep the fire alive.” In 2021, Naituli was featured in the documentary “Cold Feet,” with the intention of showcasing Kenya as a climbing mecca, in the hopes that it’ll help grow the local industry – and dispel the notion that climbing is a White sport. “It’s not just a Western activity, it’s something here in the country, and just by watching someone else do it, (Kenyans) can have something to live up to,” he says. Non-profits such as Climbing Life Kenya and Mountain Club of Kenya are making climbing more accessible and reducing the barriers to participate. In 2012, Climb BlueSky – the first public climbing gym in East Africa – opened its doors in Nairobi. Still, Naituli says he’d like to see more gyms and increased access for climbing in Kenya, noting that the talent exists, but the opportunities do not. “Having a story from a country like Kenya with the Kenyan climbers as the protagonists, that is a story which we need to tell,” Naituli says, showcasing “a different look on Kenya, a different look on the world of climbing.” ",1306,,travel-article-africa-black-mountain-climbers-diversity-spc-intl,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/africa-black-mountain-climbers-diversity-spc-intl

      Nepali Sherpa breaks his own climbing record
    ","A 47-year-old Nepali sherpa has set a climbing record by scaling all the world’s 14 peaks that are higher than 8,000 meters (26,247 ft) for a second time, his agency said on Thursday. Sanu Sherpa, from Sankhuwasabha district in east Nepal, reached the top of Pakistan’s Gasherbrum II, which at 8,035 meters is the 13th highest, on Thursday morning, his Pioneer Adventure hiking company said in Kathmandu. “He is the only person in the world to scale each of the 14 highest mountains twice,” Nibesh Karki, the company’s executive director told Reuters. No further details were available. Eight of the 14 highest peaks, including Mount Everest, are in Nepal. The other six are in Pakistan and the Tibet region of China.
