Tucker Carlson leaves Fox News," Tucker Carlson, the highest-rated cable TV host credited with setting the agenda for US conservatives, has left Fox News, the network announced. In a statement, Fox News said it and Carlson had agreed to ""part ways"". His last TV programme was Friday 21 April, the statement added. His primetime slot will now be hosted by a series of interim hosts until a permanent replacement is found. The brief two-paragraph statement gave no reason for the abrupt decision. The Los Angeles Times, citing unnamed people familiar with the situation, reports that the decision to fire Carlson came from the top, including Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan. The 53-year-old was not just a popular presenter, but also a hugely influential one. His shows frequently set the agenda for conservatives and, by extension, the Republican party. His programme offered a blend of populist conservative takes on issues ranging from immigration, crime, race, gender and sexuality, with ""woke"" ideology becoming a frequent target. It made up four of the top 10 rated programmes on US cable TV, according to Nielsen data for the week 27 March to 2 April. He was Fox News' top-rated host, with more than three million viewers tuning in on an average night. While Carlson often publicly agreed with Donald Trump, whose politics have transformed the Republican party in recent years, he would occasionally diverge from the former president's political views. Fox News' competitors were quick to capitalise on Carlson's departure. One rival network, Newsmax, said it had successfully attracted viewers from Fox News in recent months and Carlson's departure would ""only fuel that trend"". The announcement of Carlson's departure comes just days after Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting machine company Dominion over the cable network's coverage of the 2020 presidential election. In the lawsuit, Dominion argued that its business was harmed by Fox spreading false claims that its machines were rigged against Mr Trump. The case prompted disclosures of text messages that showed Carlson's private views often contrasted with his on-air output. His show, which aired in the coveted 20:00 to 21:00 EST slot, was cited in court documents by Dominion's attorneys in their claim some of its output was defamatory. Additionally, Fox News is also facing a lawsuit filed in March by former guest booker Abby Grossberg in which she accused Carlson of ""vile sexist stereotypes"". Fox News has counter-sued and said it would ""vigorously defend these claims"". Carlson's latest interview with Mr Trump came two weeks ago, despite disclosures in the Dominion case showing he had privately said of the ex-president: ""I hate him passionately."" He also interviewed Twitter CEO Elon Musk during what would become his final week on Fox News. His departure appears to have been sudden and came without the usual farewell that might be expected from a long-serving presenter. A video shared on Twitter by journalist Aaron Rupar showed Carlson ending his show on Friday with the words ""we'll be back on Monday"". On air on Monday morning, a Fox News anchor announced the departure with a tribute that thanked Carlson ""for his service to the network"". Stepping in for the primetime slot that night, guest host Brian Kilmeade briefly remarked on his colleague's departure. He told viewers: ""As you probably have heard, Fox News and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. I wish Tucker the best. I'm great friends with Tucker and always will be."" Carlson first joined Fox as a contributor in 2009 before becoming a co-host of the Fox and Friends Weekend show between 2012-16. He began hosting the Tucker Carlson Show in 2016. Before his Fox career began, Carlson also hosted shows on CNN and MSNBC and co-founded the Daily Caller website. His tenure at CNN ended in 2005, just months after a heated on-air exchange with Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Fox Corporation, the Murdoch-controlled company that owns Fox News, saw its share price drop more than 3% in New York after the announcement. That is comparable to the initial reaction when the company announced it would pay $787m (£631m) to settle the defamation suit brought by Dominion, though the shares in that case quickly recovered. One way that Carlson's departure could affect Fox News financially is in its forthcoming negotiations with cable networks over lucrative so-called carriage fees - paid to Fox by cable firms for carrying its network. These fees are critical to the company's bottom line and it now enters negotiations with a vacancy in its most prominent time slot. Another cable TV host, CNN's Don Lemon, announced on Monday that he had been ""terminated"" by CNN after 17 years, just hours after appearing on its recently re-launched morning show. The embattled host had come under intense public criticism earlier this year for disparaging remarks about Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley.

Sudan crisis: Warring sides agree to ceasefire," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says warring parties in Sudan have agreed to a 72-hour ceasefire from midnight (22:00 GMT) on Monday. It is at least the third ceasefire to be announced since violence erupted this month but none have held. Mr Blinken said an agreement had been reached between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after 48 hours of negotiations. At least 400 people have been killed since fighting erupted on 15 April. Both sides independently announced their involvement in the ceasefire. UN Secretary General António Guterres has warned the violence in Sudan risks causing a ""catastrophic conflagration"" that could engulf the whole region and beyond. Since the violence began, residents of the battle-scarred capital Khartoum have been told to stay inside, and food and water supplies have been running low. The bombing has hit key infrastructure, like water pipes, meaning that some people have been forced to drink from the River Nile. There will be hopes the ceasefire will allow civilians to leave the city. Foreign governments will also hope it will allow for continued evacuations out of the country. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their diplomats and civilians as fighting raged in central, densely populated parts of the capital. Earlier on Monday, Mr Blinken said that some convoys trying to move people out had encountered ""robbery and looting"". The US, he added, was looking at potentially resuming its diplomatic presence in Sudan but he described the conditions there as ""very challenging"". Sudan is suffering an ""internet blackout"" with connectivity at 2% of ordinary levels, monitoring group NetBlocks said on Monday. In Khartoum, the internet has been down since Sunday night. It is estimated that tens of thousands of people, including Sudanese citizens and those from neighbouring countries, have fled because of the unrest. Hassan Ibrahim, 91, was among them. The retired physician lives near the main airport in Khartoum, where some of the worst fighting has taken place, but has since made the perilous journey into neighbouring Egypt with his family. He told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme they had escaped being caught up in a firefight between RSF fighters and the army but that a van travelling behind them had got hit. The family then boarded a bus to the border, which took 12 hours, only for them to be met by ""crowded and chaotic"" scenes as people waited to be given entry. ""There were so many families with elderly passengers, children and babies,"" said Mr Ibrahim. ""The Sudanese are fleeing the country - it is a sad reality."" Eiman ab Garga, a British-Sudanese gynaecologist who works in the UK, was visiting the capital with her children when the fighting began and has just been evacuated to Djibouti on a flight organised by France. Her hurried departure meant that she was not able to say goodbye to her ailing father, nor her mother and sister. 'The country is dirty, there's rubbish all over it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme. ""There's sewage overflowing it smells so now we're next going to have an outbreak of illness and disease and there won't be a hospital to go to there."" ""We're just looking at death and destruction and destitution."" Violence broke out primarily in Khartoum, between rival military factions battling for control of Africa's third largest country. This came after days of tension as members of the RSF were redeployed around the country in a move that the army saw as a threat. Since a 2021 coup, Sudan has been run by a council of generals, led by the two military men at the centre of this dispute - Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the armed forces and in effect the country's president, and his deputy and leader of the RSF, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti. They have disagreed on the direction the country is going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule. The main sticking points are plans to include the 100,000-strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the new force. Gen Dagalo has accused Gen Burhan's government of being ""radical Islamists"" and that he and the RSF were ""fighting for the people of Sudan to ensure the democratic progress for which they have so long yearned"". Many find this message hard to believe, given the brutal track record of the RSF. Gen Burhan has said he supports the idea of returning to civilian rule, but that he will only hand over power to an elected government.

"'You'll never catch me lying,' Tucker Carlson said", ,756,world,2023-04-25T03:10:34.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65382129
Trump faces civil trial for E Jean Carroll rape allegation," Former President Donald Trump is facing a civil trial over an allegation that he raped an advice columnist nearly three decades ago. Jury selection is due to begin on Tuesday in a New York federal court. Mr Trump has denied E Jean Carroll's accusation that he attacked her in a Manhattan department store. He has said she made up the claim for publicity. Though this is not a criminal case, the consequences for Mr Trump could nevertheless be serious. If Ms Carroll wins the lawsuit, it would be the first time the former president - who has been the subject of more than two dozen such allegations - would be found legally responsible for a sexual assault. Mr Trump is facing a wave of other legal troubles, including more than two dozen felony counts over payment of hush money to an adult film actress and an investigation into his alleged role in the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. Mr Trump is also juggling his ongoing bid for the White House next year. Here's what to expect at the trial. Ms Carroll, 79, says the attack occurred at a Bergdorf Goodman store in Manhattan in late 1995 or early 1996. The pair had bumped into each other while shopping, she said. Mr Trump then allegedly asked her for advice when buying lingerie for another woman and jokingly asked her to model it for him. But once in the changing rooms, Ms Carroll said the real estate tycoon lunged at her, pinned her against a wall and assaulted her. Ms Carroll, whose ""Ask E. Jean"" advice column has appeared in Elle magazine since 1993, claims she managed to push him off after a ""colossal struggle"". She did not report the alleged encounter to police, her complaint said, because she ""was in shock and did not wish to think of herself as a rape victim"". Two of Ms Carroll's friends, Carol Martin and Lisa Birnbach, have said the writer told them about the alleged incident within days. Ms Martin and Ms Birchbach are on the list of witnesses that Ms Carroll may call to testify. Mr Trump has issued multiple denials in the years since Ms Carroll came forward with her allegations in 2019. He has described her claims as a ""complete con job"" on his social media platform Truth Social, saying the alleged rape ""never happened"". And during an October deposition for the case, Mr Trump repeated his denials, adding that his accuser is ""not my type"". It is so far unclear if Mr Trump will make an appearance during the trial, which is expected to last up to two weeks. He is not required to attend and Ms Carroll's lawyers have said they do not plan to call him as a witness. Lawyers for the accuser plan to play to jurors a recording, known as the Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr Trump is heard boasting about grabbing women's genitals. Lawyers for Ms Carroll also plan to call other women who say they were attacked by Mr Trump to testify at the trial. The criminal statute of limitations for this case has long expired. And typically, the statute of limitations for people to bring civil lawsuits over sexual assault in New York is three years, meaning it too has long lapsed. But in 2022, New York passed the Adult Survivors Act, which allowed a one-year period for victims to file sexual assault lawsuits in the state over claims that would have otherwise exceeded statute limitations. Ms Carroll filed her lawsuit against Mr Trump almost immediately after the law took effect. Before this case, the writer had also sued Mr Trump for defamation after he called her a liar following the publication of her memoir. That lawsuit is currently stalled as courts debate whether there is a legal right to sue ex-presidents. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and a Democratic donor, has helped pay Ms Carroll's legal bills, according to court filings. Mr Trump's lawyers tried to delay the trial after they learned of Mr Hoffman's role, saying it raised questions about Ms Carroll's motives. The judge dismissed this motion, but allowed lawyers to ask Ms Carroll about the financing. In a statement, Mr Hoffman defended his support of Ms Carroll, saying he had ""never taken any steps to hide the financial support that I have provided to this lawsuit after it started"". ""Our courts are a mechanism of justice for all citizens, not just those with enough money and power to rig the game in their favour,"" he said.

Sudan fighting: On a bus to Egypt with Mario the pug," Noon Abdelbassit Ibrahim, a 21-year-old medical student, and her family are among thousands to have fled Sudan - they are now safe in the Egyptian capital Cairo after a dangerous two-day journey. They crowded into a packed bus which left Khartoum in the early hours of 20 April, travelling with friends and neighbours who spent $5,000 (£4,000) hiring the vehicle. Noon's pug, Mario, was also with them. But for the first few days of the rapidly escalating conflict Noon's family hesitated to make a move. ""We thought the borders with neighbouring countries would be closed, and we could get stuck somewhere,"" she has told the BBC. Everything changed on 18 April when her family home was hit by a missile. Noon lives in Burri, the same Khartoum district where the army headquarters is located. ""Everybody just hid in my grandma's room, so scared that we wouldn't be that lucky again,"" she says. ""We all knew we couldn't stay after that."" Houses and businesses on Noon's street have been hit by stray bullets. One of her mother's acquaintances was gunned down. There has also been widespread disruption to the power and water network, as well as a shortage of food. The bus was expensive - but worth every dollar. ""That was all the money we had with us but we were actually lucky,"" says Noon. ""A friend of mine had arranged to hire a bus for $8,000, but at the last minute the owner doubled the price."" She is now staying at a relative's apartment in the Egyptian capital and is coming to terms with the anxiety that marked the trip, fuelled by seeing destroyed tanks and dead bodies on the streets of Khartoum. Thanks to the presence of several children and elderly people on the bus, they navigated army and paramilitary checkpoints around the capital without any problems. ""I am just so relieved we have managed to flee. I never thought we were going to make it,"" Noon admits. Her fears were increased by a scare right at the start of the trip. Her family was preparing to drive to a location where the bus was waiting when a rocket hit a building in a neighbouring street. ""We ran back inside, fearing for our lives. But a few minutes later we made the decision to just get on with the journey."" At the Egyptian border, one of Noon's brothers and two uncles had to stay behind to try and arrange a visa. Sudanese women, children and people over 50 do not need a visa to enter Egypt. When the fighting erupted, Noon had already started her last year in medical school. She hopes to resume her studies at some point and qualify as a doctor. For now, she just wants her country to return to some kind of normality. ""The situation back home is chaotic. People are running out of everything,"" she says. Noon also has a message for the two military leaders driving this confrontation. ""They've killed enough innocent lives. There are other ways to solve the issues between them and they should put an immediate stop to this war."" ",521,world,2023-04-25T00:18:47.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65381618
Haiti crisis: Mob burns suspected gang members to death," A group of 13 suspected gang members has been beaten and burned to death by a mob in Haiti's capital after being seized while police were searching their vehicle. The suspects were reportedly beaten with gasoline-soaked tyres before being set alight in Port-au-Prince on Monday. Police say they confiscated weapons from them just before the incident. They have not explained how members of the public got hold of the suspects. Haiti has descended into increasing lawlessness since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021. The United Nations said in a report published on Monday that insecurity in the capital has reached levels similar to countries at war. Armed gangs continue to compete to expand their territorial control and that clashes with police and rival gangs have ""become more violent and more frequent,"" claiming many civilian lives, it added. Gang violence led to the death of nearly 70 people, including 18 women and two children, between 14 and 19 April alone, according to the UN. Many schools and health centres have been forced to close and the violence has also affected access to many goods and services. ""The people of Haiti continue to suffer one of the worst human rights crises in decades and a major humanitarian emergency,"" the report reads. Since Moïse's assassination, the Caribbean nation has been led by Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who has failed to rein in the gangs that now control an estimated 60% of the capital. Mr Henry and UN officials have repeatedly called for the deployment of an international force to help police in their fight against the criminal gangs. So far, no country has offered to lead such a force. The United States has been trying to convince Canada to take on the role but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has so far resisted. Mr Henry has said it is key to providing security so that long-postponed elections can be held. ",319,world,2023-04-24T23:53:02.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-65381624
Facebook work filtering posts 'cost me my humanity'," Readers may find material in this article disturbing. Behind the scenes on Facebook, thousands of moderators protect users from graphic content by filtering out posts that break its rules. The BBC has spoken to one moderator based in Kenya, who is taking legal action against its parent company Meta. On his first day of work screening posts, South African Trevin Brownie watched a man take his own life. ""The problem was not [the taking of his own life]. The problem was the three-year-old boy that was in the video with this guy. So the boy was playing on the floor with these toys, like not even understanding what's happening"". It took two or three minutes for the child to realise something was wrong and to call out for his dad. He then started crying. Eventually an adult entered the room, and the recording was stopped. ""I felt sick. I, you know, I was vomiting because I didn't understand why people would even do things like that,"" Mr Brownie said. In the course of his work, Mr Brownie would see the worst of humanity - from child abuse to torture and suicide bombings. His experience, he believes, deadened his feelings. The tremor in his voice and his sympathy suggests he still cares deeply about others, but Mr Brownie believes part of his humanity is gone. ""Because I'm basically so much used to death and seeing death. It became a norm for me,"" he says. Deaths no longer affect him as he feels they should. Mr Brownie sees those who work in moderation as a front line of defence protecting users, especially during the pandemic, when many relied on the internet. The way Facebook connects people around the world also appeals to him. In January, Facebook's main moderation hub for east Africa, Sama, announced it would stop providing content-review services to social media firms. Last month Sama laid off 260 moderators, including Mr Brownie, as it concentrated on work annotating videos to help train artificial intelligence computer vision systems. ""I sacrificed my human side for this job. I don't think you can give any more than your soul, and then to be kicked out like this,"" Mr Brownie said. He is concerned about the future, as he and his fiancée hoped to get married, and his family in South Africa rely upon money he sends them. Mr Brownie says he would have not taken the job if he had known what it involved, but feels it is important work he is good at, and where he earned promotion to a more senior role. He wants his employment to continue, but with more support for his mental health. He is one of a group of 184 moderators, supported by the campaign group Foxglove, who are taking legal action against Meta, Facebook's parent company, Sama, and Meta's new contractor, Luxembourg-based firm Majorel. Meta has sought to extricate itself from the action, but a ruling on Thursday now means it can be sued for unfair termination. Cori Crider, a director at Foxglove, called the decision ""a milestone"" and said that ""no tech giant, however wealthy, should be above the law"". An interim ruling against Meta and Sama already means the moderators contracts cannot be terminated and they must still be paid until the case is decided. The moderators say they were laid-off in retaliation for complaints about working conditions and attempts to form a union. They also allege they were unfairly discriminated against and refused work at Majorel ""on the basis that they previously worked at the [Sama] facility"", the petition to the court states. Text messages shared with the moderators' legal team, and seen by the BBC, show moderators interested in applying for a job at Majorel were told by a third-party recruiter that: ""The company will not accept candidates from Sama. It's a strict no."" Meta has declined to comment, citing continuing legal action. But the company requires its contractors to provide round-the-clock on-site support with trained practitioners, and access to private healthcare from the first day of employment. Majorel declined to comment while legal action was continuing. A Sama spokesperson told the BBC that it paid moderators fair, local living wages that were among the top 12 paying jobs in Kenya. It said it provided ""extensive mental health services, including on-site licenced and trained mental health professionals, a 24-hour hotline and virtual consultations. In addition, employees are free to see a mental health professional of their choosing using the healthcare benefits"". Its wellbeing service will continue for 12 months after the last day of employment. Sama said accusations against the firm have proved to be untrue, which was why ""former moderators are suing to keep their jobs - other companies offer a fraction of the pay and benefits compared to Sama"". The BBC has also seen emails sent to Sama from a small number of moderators, expressing their frustration that the injunction means the company cannot pay termination benefits such as free flights to home countries. Two emails praise working conditions at Sama, and one person voices their unhappiness at the court action. In February, a Kenyan court ruled that Meta could be sued by ex-moderator Daniel Motaung over claims of poor working conditions. Meta also faces legal action in Nairobi concerning allegations its algorithm helped fuel the viral spread on social media of hate and violence during Ethiopia's civil war.

"Don Lemon, CNN anchor, fired after 17 years on the network"," CNN anchor Don Lemon has hit out at the network after his firing, which came after accusations of misogyny and misbehaviour. ""I am stunned,"" Lemon wrote on Twitter, saying he was told by his agent he had been let go. CNN said it ""parted ways"" with Lemon, who co-hosted its morning show, saying ""we wish him well"". It follows on-air remarks by Lemon in which he said Republican Nikki Haley, 51, was not ""in her prime"". The dismissal also comes on the heels of another major US media departure. Just moments before Lemon's announcement, Fox News announced it was parting ways with primetime host Tucker Carlson. A long-time fixture of the network, Lemon was most recently a co-host of CNN's This Morning programme. But he landed in hot water earlier this year after comments he made about Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, a former UN ambassador and governor of South Carolina. Ms Haley was not ""in her prime"", Lemon said in February, a remark widely decried as sexist. ""When a woman is considered to be in her prime - in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s,"" he said. ""I'm just saying what the facts are - Google it,"" he added, in response to objections from his female co-hosts, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins. Lemon issued a statement on the same day saying he regretted his ""inartful and irrelevant"" comments. He also apologised to the newsroom and agreed to partake in ""mandatory training"" to address the incident. But the remarks sparked widespread criticism, including from actress Michelle Yeoh, 60, who appeared to reference the comments in her Oscar's acceptance speech last month, saying: ""Ladies, don't let anybody tell you you're ever past your prime."" In a tweet on Monday, Ms Haley appeared to address the firing, calling it a ""great day for women everywhere"" adding ""#StillInMyPrime"". Lemon's reputation was further clouded by a report from Variety earlier in April, which detailed accusations of misogynistic behaviour toward his CNN colleagues. He called a producer fat to her face, Variety reported, mocked and mimicked one colleague and allegedly sent threatening texts to another. A representative for Lemon denied the reports. Lemon has also faced controversy last autumn for saying that the US men's soccer team should be paid more than the women's, saying that the men were ""more interesting to watch"". The 57-year-old had appeared on CNN on Monday during the morning programme as normal, before reports of his dismissal were publicised later that day. ""After 17 years at CNN I would have thought someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly,"" Lemon wrote on Twitter. ""At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network."" He continued: ""It is clear that there are larger issues at play."" The network did not elaborate on the reason for his dismissal. But in a second statement issued on Monday afternoon, it called Lemon's description of events ""inaccurate"", saying he had been given an opportunity to meet with management. Lemon has hired entertainment lawyer Bryan Freedman to address his contract with CNN, which was signed to last until 2026, the New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the deal. CNN This Morning will continue with Lemon's former co-hosts, Ms Harlow and Ms Collins, the network said. Lemon came to CNN in 2006 after working for a local NBC station in Chicago. For over eight years, he hosted the primetime show Don Lemon Tonight. He left the slot to help launch CNN This Morning last November alongside Ms Harlow and Ms Collins. After Lemon's comments about Ms Haley, CNN producers discovered guests did not want to appear on the show with Lemon, the New York Times reported. The show has struggled with ratings in recent months, lagging behind Fox's Fox & Friends and MSNBC's Morning Joe. In a post on his social media site Truth Social on Monday, former President Donald Trump referred to Lemon as the ""dumbest man on television"". He did not comment on Tucker Carlson's firing.

Julie Chavez Rodriguez: Five facts about Biden's 2024 campaign manager," US President Joe Biden is gearing up to formally declare that he will seek re-election and his campaign-in-waiting now has its leader. Senior White House adviser Julie Chavez Rodriguez, 45, will serve as the president's 2024 campaign manager, US media reported on Sunday. Mr Biden, 80, has delayed formally announcing his candidacy but may do so as soon as this week. Here is what you need to know about the woman in charge of his latest campaign. Ms Rodriguez is the granddaughter of the famed labour leader Cesar Chavez and labour activist Helen Fabela Chavez. Cesar Chavez, a Mexican-American civil-rights activist who fought to improve working and living conditions for farm workers in the 1960s and 1970s, is an icon within organised labour and leftist circles. Since Mr Biden's first day as president, he has proudly displayed a bronze bust of Chavez on his desk in the Oval Office. The bust was personally lent to him by Chavez's son Paul. Last month, First Lady Jill Biden and Ms Rodriguez also planted a commemorative Cesar Chavez Rose in the White House Rose Garden. Ms Rodriguez has often described being an activist from a very young age. Raised in California's Central Valley and educated at the University of California, Berkeley, she attended rallies and did community outreach as a child, continuing her grandfather's fight for farm labourers. According to the New York Times, Ms Rodriguez was once arrested while distributing fliers about the dangers of pesticides at a protest outside a local supermarket. She was nine years old at the time. ""I was exposed to organising at such an early age, both as a skill set but also as an ethos,"" she told Bustle magazine in 2020. After Cesar Chavez founded the United Farm Workers labour union in 1962, its rallying cry became ""Si se puede"" - loosely translated in English to ""Yes we can"". That phrase became one of Barack Obama's main slogans in his 2008 campaign for president. After eight years working as the programme director at her grandfather's namesake foundation, Ms Rodriguez made her first foray into Washington politics during the Obama administration. She first served in the US Department of the Interior before rising through the White House's office of public engagement and later becoming a special assistant to President Obama. Mr Obama is not the only top Democrat Ms Rodriguez has worked for. In late 2016, she became state director for Kamala Harris' campaign for the open US Senate seat in California. And when Ms Harris launched her 2020 bid for president, Ms Rodriguez served as the campaign's national political director and later as a travelling chief of staff. Concerns have been raised about Mr Biden's advanced age - and Ms Harris, as vice-president, remains the Democrat most likely to succeed him. Ms Rodriguez has worked for Joe Biden since 2020. She first served as a senior adviser overseeing Latino voter outreach during his presidential campaign, then was appointed as the director of the White House's office of intergovernmental affairs. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, she was promoted as a senior adviser to the president - making her the highest-ranking Latina in the building. It comes at a time when some Democrats have expressed concern that the party is losing support with Hispanic voters in several key states. Ms Rodriguez was chosen for the role of campaign manager over Jen O'Malley Dillon, who led Mr Biden's successful 2020 campaign and now serves as his deputy chief of staff. She also beat Mr Biden's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who managed his previous political campaigns. ",596,world,2023-04-24T21:38:11.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65372527
Kenya starvation cult: The unbearable stench of mass graves," In the middle of a forest not far from Kenya's coast, piles of fresh earth topped with crucifixes await the attention of forensic experts. About 14 mass graves have so far been dug up and Hussein Khalid has spent the past four days watching people exhume dozens of bodies. ""The stench is unbearable,"" he tells the BBC. The dead - now numbering more than 70 - are thought to have been members of the Good News International Church. It is believed they were persuaded to starve themselves in order to reach heaven before what they were told was going to be the end of the world. Mr Khalid runs the rights organisation Haki Africa, which took the authorities to the grave sites at the end of last week after being tipped off by some locals. The place is ""quite hidden"" inside Shakahola forest and he says that he and his team needed to cut back shrubs and bushes in order to drive there. Thirty-nine bodies have been exhumed so far but the police say that 58 have died in all as some who were rescued succumbed while being treated. The final count could be much higher as the Red Cross has said that said 112 people have been reported missing. Mr Khalid estimates that there are around 60 mass grave sites in the area and only a fifth of those have been examined. Police say that 29 survivors have been found so far, but it seems that not all of them wanted to be rescued, so convinced they were about what they were told about the end of the world. On Sunday, Mr Khalid came across a woman in her late 20s ""looking extremely frail"" with sunken eyes. But she did not want to be helped. ""When we tried to administer first aid to give her sips of water with glucose with a spoon, she completely refused. She sealed her mouth shut and she was signifying that she doesn't want any help,"" Mr Khalid says, adding that the woman was now being treated in hospital. He also came across a man in his 40s who was able to talk. ""He said he didn't need any saving, and that he was in his senses and he knows what he's doing and he should be left alone. He even called us enemies of him going to heaven."" That man has also been taken to hospital. Victor Kaudo from the Malindi Community Human Rights Centre, which is helping exhume the bodies, says he thinks there are about 150 bodies. He said his organisation had been contacted by a whistleblower who wanted help rescuing his three children. ""It was quite unfortunate because we only rescued one whom we found in a house, tied with a rope,"" he told the BBC. ""And this kid we believe to be six years of age. But his sister and brother were already dead and they had been buried the previous day before we got there."" Beyond the forest itself, there is shock in the country over how dozens of people could have willingly starved themselves to death. Kenya is a profoundly religious country with 85% of the population identifying as Christian. President William Ruto, who is a devout man himself, has described the head of the Good News International Church, Pastor Makenzie Nthenge, as someone who did ""not belong to any religion"". Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki has called what happened a ""massacre"". Last month Mr Nthenge was charged in connection with the deaths of two children whose parents had joined his church. He was released on bail, but he is now back in police custody. The speaker of the Senate, Amason Kingi, asked how ""evil of such an astounding magnitude [could] take place without being detected"". There is also the question of why someone would starve themself. Theologian and psychologist Dr James Kipsang Barngetuny told the BBC that there was a problem in Kenya with the ""mushrooming"" of lots of small churches, which are not properly regulated. He said that unscrupulous leaders are able to brainwash people and take advantage of their desire to find a solution to their problems. Back in the forest, Mr Khalid has been told that there is a place deeper inside where people gathered to pray and he has urged the authorities to step up a search-and-rescue operation in the forest, which covers some 800 acres (325 hectares). Local people are beginning to come to the grave sites to tell the authorities about relatives who are missing. One man told Mr Khalid that his three sons, aged 21, 17 and 14, had been taken by his brother to join the church. He feared that they were all now dead.

Sudan: UK sends military team as it weighs evacuation options," A small British military reconnaissance team is in Sudan to consider evacuation options, as pressure builds on the government to rescue more UK nationals. Defence minister James Heappey confirmed troops are there - but no evacuation plan has yet been announced. On Sunday, the UK airlifted diplomats and their families out of Sudan in a military operation. But thousands of UK passport holders remain in the country, where hundreds have died amid street gun battles. Violence broke out on 15 April, primarily in the capital city Khartoum, between rival military factions battling for control of Africa's third largest country. Around 4,000 UK citizens are thought to be in Sudan and 2,000 of them have already requested help, Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell told MPs on Tuesday. Hundreds of people have been airlifted from Sudan by other countries, including more than 1,000 people by European Union nations. Five British people were among nearly 200 people evacuated by Saudi Arabia. Some UK nationals have said they felt abandoned by the government. Amar Osman, a British citizen from Dunfermline in Fife, told the BBC he feared his family would die in Sudan unless they could get themselves out after becoming trapped north of the capital. ""It's getting worse by the minute, so we're thinking of evacuating by road to Egypt,"" said Mr Osman, who was visiting relatives when fighting began. ""I'm doing it all by myself. I'm getting the money together, I'm getting all my family together. There's six of us."" News of a 72 hour ceasefire due to come into effect from midnight on Tuesday will raise hopes that a mass evacuation may be more feasible, but previous agreements between the warring parties have failed to hold. The BBC understands a small military team landed in Port Sudan, more than 500 miles from Khartoum, to asses potential routes out. Work is under way to provide the prime minister with several options, defence sources said, and it is understood two Royal Navy ships are already in the region - the frigate HMS Lancaster which was already at sea, and supply ship RFA Cardigan Bay which is in Bahrain where it was undergoing maintenance. Mr Mitchell urged anyone trapped in Sudan to stay indoors where possible but to ""exercise their own judgement about whether to relocate"", adding they ""do so at their own risk"". He told the Commons that Khartoum's main airport, where there has been fighting in recent days, was ""out of action"". Energy and communications were disrupted, while food and water were becoming ""increasingly scarce"", he said. Defence sources told the BBC any Sudan evacuation would be more difficult than the August 2021 Afghanistan airlift, due to fighting around the capital and an absence of troops already on the ground. Khartoum is ""more dynamic, more dangerous"" than Kabul was at the time, they said, with armed clashes happening ""in the neighbourhoods where western nationals are most heavily concentrated"". Commenting on the advice being issued to people trapped in Sudan, the defence source added: ""If you tell people to stay at home they may be less likely to get shot. But the availability of food and water in the city is increasingly limited. ""If you tell people to leave home it's towards safety. Then they get closer to food and water but they might be at increased risk."" Responding to questions from MPs, Mr Mitchell also confirmed that neither the UK's ambassador to Sudan nor the deputy head of mission were in the country when the conflict began. A team of 200 officials is working around the clock in the Foreign Office to provide consular assistance to those who need it, and regular updates are being issued, he added. British doctor Iman Abu Gargar told the BBC she was able to leave with the French evacuation because Irish passport holders, including her son, were able to join. Speaking from Djibouti, which lies to the east of Sudan, Dr Gargar said she felt left behind by the UK. She said she was forced to leave her father there, adding: ""There were only difficult decisions to make. I hope no-one has to make the decisions I had to make."" Some MPs have put pressure on the government to speed up efforts, including Alicia Kearns, the Tory chairwoman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, who told the Commons that ""time is running out"". Labour's shadow minister for Africa, Lyn Brown, said what people trapped in Sudan need to hear ""is a clear plan on how the government will support those still in danger and how they will communicate with them and when"". She added: ""Naturally, questions will be asked about whether the government has learned the lessons of the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal."" A successful operation to rescue diplomats and their families was carried out over the weekend, after gun battles broke out around the embassy in Khartoum. The BBC understands that UK special forces troops landed in Khartoum on Saturday alongside the US evacuation team. Military vehicles were used to rescue embassy staff and transport them to an airport outside the capital, before they were flown to Cyprus. Around 1,200 personnel from the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force were involved in the rescue, and a C-130 Hercules and Airbus A400M transport aircraft were used. Mr Heappey, who holds the armed forces portfolio in the MoD, said the embassy rescue mission ""went without a hitch"" despite its complexity but that the ""job isn't done"". The situation on the ground is at times ""extremely dangerous"", he said, and the ""window in which the environment is permissive is rarely long enough in which to do the military options"". Mr Heappey admitted the UK had been caught out by the rapid deterioration in Sudan, adding: ""It is fair to say that nobody in the UK government nor really in the wider international community saw fighting of this ferocity breaking out in the way that it did."" Around 400 UK nationals in Sudan hold only a British passport, while about 4,000 more are dual citizens, Mr Mitchell told the Commons. Another Cobra meeting - an emergency response committee made up of ministers, civil servants and others - was held on Monday to discuss the situation. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres told a meeting of the UN Security Council that the situation in Sudan was worsening and the country was on ""the edge of the abyss"". ""The violence must stop. It risks a catastrophic conflagration within Sudan that could engulf the whole region and beyond,"" he said. Sudan has experienced a near total internet outage in recent days, but BBC Monitoring reported that some connectivity was returning on Monday night.

Pakistan: Explosions kill 12 in Swat Valley counter-terror office," At least 12 people have been killed in two explosions at a counter-terrorism office in north-west Pakistan, officials say. Police said that there is no evidence of an attack and that it could have been as a result of an electrical fault igniting ammunition in the centre. Most of the dead are police officers. The explosion happened in the Swat valley, which was controlled by Islamist militants before they were forced out in 2009. More than 40 people were injured and buildings have collapsed. A spokesman for provincial police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which neighbours Afghanistan, said that ammunition caught fire, ""most probably due to an electric short-circuit"". ""No evidence of an attack from outside has been established so far."" The Pakistani Taliban group has carried out several attacks targeting security forces in recent months, but has not claimed involvement in these explosions. The regional chief of the counter-terrorism department Sohail Khalid told Reuters that the explosions did not appear to be an act of terrorism. ""There was a store where we had a huge quantity of weapons, and until now we believe that there might have some blast in it due to some carelessness"" he said. ""We are keeping all our options open."" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially called the blasts a ""suicide attack"", but later tweeted that that ""the nature of the blast is being investigated"". Pakistani counter-terrorist forces maintain a strong presence in the valley, which has been prone to insurgency. In 2012, militants also shot and wounded Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai in the valley. ",257,world,2023-04-24T20:47:29.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65380153
Ukraine war: Kyiv secures bridgehead across key Dnipro River - reports," Ukrainian troops have set up positions on the east bank of the Dnipro River in southern Kherson region, reports say. The region is partially Russian-held and crossing the river could be significant in future offensives. The US-based Institute for the Study of War says Russian military bloggers have posted ""enough geolocated footage and text reports to confirm"" the advance. BBC Ukraine says its military sources have reported a ""certain movement across [the] Dnipro"" near Kherson city. Ukraine's military has not confirmed the movement, while Russia has denied the reports. But if the reports that Ukraine has secured a bridgehead on the east bank are correct, it could be significant in helping Kyiv drive Russian troops back. A Ukrainian advance in the area could, in the future, even cut the land corridor to Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014. However, military experts say any Ukrainian troop movements in the bridgehead area - which is crisscrossed by floodplains, irrigation canals and other water obstacles - would be a tough task. And Ukrainian advances would be further complicated by Russia's significant advantage in the air. Ukraine's military has for some time publicly spoken about preparations for a major counter-offensive, without specifying where and when it could be launched. Until now, all of the Kherson region on the east bank of the Dnipro has been under Russian control, with the wide river serving as a natural barrier. The regional capital - sitting on the west bank - was liberated by Ukrainian forces last November. In Sunday's report, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said ""geolocated footage published on 23 April indicates that Ukrainian forces are operating in areas north-west of Oleshky on the east"" bank of Dnipro. The ISW added there was not enough information to analyse the scale of the reported Ukrainian advance - or the further intentions of the Ukrainian military. On Monday, Russia's WarGonzo military blogger reported that Ukrainian troops were ""trying to gain a foothold on Bolshoi Potemkin [Velykyi Potyomkin - Ukrainian] island"", which is located between the new and old channels of the Dnipro. Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's South Command, neither confirmed nor denied reports that Ukrainian forces had secured a bridgehead on the east bank. She told Ukraine's TV channels that ""difficult work is continuing"". A military operation requires ""informational silence until it is safe enough for our military"", the spokeswoman stressed. Meanwhile, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Sunday ""there were no bridgeheads on the left [east] bank near Oleshky, or any other places"" on that side of the river.

Comedian Richard Lewis says he has Parkinson's Disease," Comedian Richard Lewis has opened up about his diagnosis with Parkinson's Disease in a Twitter video he shared on Sunday. He said he was diagnosed two years ago and had been dealing with his health privately until now. Mr Lewis just wrapped an ""amazing"" 12th season of the comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm, which he was a regular on. Though he will not continue stand-up, he said he plans to continue acting and writing. ""I'm finished with stand-up, I'm just focused on writing and acting,"" he said. ""I have Parkinson's Disease but I'm under a doctor's care, and everything is cool and I love my wife, I love my little puppy dog and I love all of my friends and my fans."" The 75-year-old shared that he has had a ""rocky time"" with his health over the last three-and-a-half years. He had four surgeries ""back-to-back"" - including back and shoulder surgery - saying ""it's bad luck but it's life"". Then after all the surgeries, he ""started walking a little stiffly"" and was ""shuffling"" his feet so he went to see a neurologist. A brain scan. about two years ago, showed that Mr Lewis had Parkinson's Disease. He said he is lucky he got it late in life, and that he is on the right medication. Mr Lewis had only appeared in one episode in the 11th season of Curb Your Enthusiasm. ""I guess I just wanted you to know that that's where it's been at,"" he said. Parkinson's ""is a progressive disorder that is caused by degeneration of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra, which controls movement"", according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Tremors and slow movement are common as well as speech changes and impaired balance. There is no cure for the disease, but medication can improve symptoms. The cause of Parkinson's is unknown, and while it can be hereditary, the environment and previous health conditions may affect it, too. Most people are diagnosed at age 60 or older. Actor Michael J Fox, diagnosed at 29, and singer Neil Diamond also have Parkinson's Disease. ",352,world,2023-04-24T18:49:30.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65380581
Sudan fighting: Hear sound of gunfire closing in on Brit's house, ,352,world,2023-04-24T18:49:30.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65374977
Sudan crisis: UK citizens 'abandoned' as evacuations fail to materialise," The UK is believed to have among the highest number of foreign citizens in Sudan - up to 4,000 according to Britain's international development minister. For more than a week they've been among the thousands confined to their homes, trapped by intense fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Hundreds of foreign nationals have already been evacuated, but the UK has faced growing criticism from many of its citizens who say they have been essentially abandoned. While the UK Foreign Office said over the weekend that it had managed to evacuate embassy staff from the capital Khartoum, it is feared that hundreds of other citizens remain trapped. In dozens of conversations with the BBC, those stuck on the ground have complained of poor communication from the Foreign Office's crisis centre. A small British military reconnaissance team is in Sudan to assess evacuation options, BBC News understands. And on Monday, Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell warned that movement in Khartoum ""remains extremely dangerous and no evacuation option comes without grave risk to life"". He said a member of the French special forces was ""gravely ill"" after being shot while trying to evacuate French diplomats. But some UK citizens say they have waited too long for help. One British citizen - William - told the BBC he had received virtually no assistance from government officials since the conflict began more than a week ago. He was forced to brave the street fighting to flee Khartoum after his situation became ""intolerable"". ""We've had absolutely nothing but nonsense from the government,"" he told the Today programme on Monday. ""Not even nonsense, we've had nothing. The last communication was that the government itself is going to do nothing, so we had to take this option."" His story mirrored that of other British citizens - who have watched on in dismay as their international counterparts have been evacuated by other governments. ""We feel abandoned,"" Edinburgh native Fatima Osman, who was visiting family when the violence began, told the BBC from Khartoum. ""It's very traumatising here and the situation is very bad, it's getting worse. The clashes, the fighting, and there are dead bodies everywhere. And everyone is trying to escape and flee the country, and you can see the country is really getting into a civil war."" Her husband, Amar Osman, said their experience of trying to get advice from the Foreign Office had left him infuriated. ""I filled the location form on the [Foreign Office] website and I received an email saying they've received my form,"" he told the Today programme as the sound of gunfire echoed nearby. ""But nothing else. It's auto reply after you submit your form and that's it."" As British nationals have tried - often in vain - to get instructions from the Foreign Office's crisis centre and the embassy in Khartoum, a host of other nations have managed to evacuate their citizens. On Monday, India's Foreign Minister Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar tweeted that more than 500 Indian citizens had reached Port Sudan on the Red Sea, about 850km (528 miles) and 13 hours drive east of Khartoum. Two air force planes and a naval vessel were on standby to evacuate the group. And long queues of United Nations vehicles and buses were seen leaving Khartoum on Sunday, also heading east towards Port Sudan and carrying ""citizens from all over the world"", a Sierra Leonean evacuee told AFP news agency. One of the first nations to evacuate citizens was Saudi Arabia. On Sunday, 91 of the Kingdom's citizens and 66 nationals of 12 other ""friendly countries"" were flown from Port Sudan to the city of Jeddah across the Red Sea. Stefano Rebora - president of Italian NGO Music for Peace - was evacuated on an emergency flight by the Italian embassy on Sunday. ""At 12.30am we got the call from the crisis unit [of the Italian foreign ministry],"" he told the BBC. ""They said they would attempt an airlift the next day and told us to go to a meeting point."" After meeting other Italian nationals at the embassy, Mr Rebora travelled in a convoy to an airfield about 20km (12 miles) away from Khartoum. ""It took us four hours to cover 20km,"" he recalled. ""On the way we saw bodies everywhere - there's no security whatsoever so nobody dares go collect them - but there's utter destruction too."" Elizabeth Boughey, a British teacher at Khartoum American School, was evacuated by the French embassy to Djibouti, alongside 200 other people of various nationalities. She said the group - which included a number of UK nationals - was taken to an airfield in northern Khartoum and flown out on two specially chartered military planes. Meanwhile, satellite photos appeared to show a Hercules C-130 transport plane on the ground at Port Sudan airfield on Sunday at 08:04 local time (10:04 BST). Reports online suggested the plane may have been either a Jordanian or a South Korean aircraft known to have been in the area at the time. Some UK nationals have turned down alternative offers of evacuation from friends, family and other nations, as they believed they had assurances of evacuations from UK officials. Dr Javid Abdelmoneim told the BBC that his elderly father has spent the past week trapped in his apartment in Garden City near Khartoum where he was observing the month of Ramadan. During a conversation with Foreign Office officials, Dr Abdelmoneim's family were told his father would be placed ""high on the evacuation list given that he is elderly and lives alone"". But he said Sunday's announcement that the UK embassy in Khartoum had been evacuated took the family by surprise. ""We have been dutifully waiting and said no to cousins leaving [in a convoy] to Port Sudan and Egypt. Our working assumption was Dad was going with the British embassy,"" Dr Abdelmoneim said. ""My sister called the crisis cell after Sunday's announcement. She asked them directly whether they were planning evacuation for British citizens and they didn't answer the question. ""All they (the FCDO) had to do is tweet out that British citizens are not being evacuated. Their communication has increased his chance of coming to harm and decreased his chance of leaving safely."" Amar Osman told the BBC that as confusion reigned and the fighting continued on Monday, he was considering taking the dangerous route out of Khartoum by road himself. Thousands of Sudanese have already taken this perilous route out of the capital. Last week, the BBC witnessed hundreds of people boarding buses and flatbed trucks at bus stations across the city. But that option is fraught with danger. The RSF is said to have set up roadblocks on major roads around Khartoum. Ms Boughey told the BBC her group was stopped and robbed of around $500 (£402) by RSF troops while moving around the city last Wednesday. Nonetheless, the risk hasn't stopped people trying to leave by road. One British woman - who asked not to be named - told the BBC that she and her relatives had rented a bus and driven to the Egyptian border after not hearing back from the British embassy in Khartoum. ""British citizens have not been given any information, the power to the mobile networks and the internet has now gone down to people won't be able to receive any information,"" she said. ""Meanwhile Dutch nationals, Greek nationals, Italian nationals, people we know are being flown from airstrips just outside of Khartoum to safety. That is citizens, not even embassy people. ""And because there's been such a breakdown in communication it turns out British citizens would have been able to get on those flights but they were advised to stay in by the British government."" Yousra - a London based accountant who was in Khartoum for her wedding - fled the capital by bus. She managed to find transportation from the adjoining city of Omdurman to the northern city of Dongola, before waiting 24 hours in the searing heat to cross the Egyptian border. Speaking to the BBC on Monday, the chair of the UK Parliament's foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns MP, accused the government of learning ""no lessons"" from the chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021. ""The reality is we have to get British nationals out,"" she told the Today programme. ""If however, there was to be no evacuation because it is too dangerous... then we have a moral obligation to tell British nationals as soon as possible that that is the judgement that has been made, because they then need to be able to make their own decision."" In a statement to the BBC, a government spokesperson defended the Foreign Office's efforts, and said that officials were ""working alongside international partners and doing all we can to ensure the safe passage of our citizens in what remains a very challenging context"". Mr Mitchell told parliament that the situation on the ground remained ""extremely grave"", but promised to look at every possibility to get British nationals out of Sudan. But the overwhelming sentiments expressed to the BBC on Monday were anger and frustration. ""We got nothing other than the government update every day which still says shelter in place, which is a joke,"" Ms Boughey told the BBC. ""In comparison with what we've seen other embassies doing, including some much smaller embassies, I don't know what the Brits did do except get some of their own out."" Kayleen Devlin, Laura Gozzi, Chris Bell, Olga Robinson and Natasha Booty also contributed to reporting for this story. Graphics by Jana Tauschinski and Tural Ahmedzade. Edited by James Stringer.

Honduras gang violence at 'war-like levels' - NGO," People living in Honduras are facing ""war-like levels of violence"", the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has warned. During a visit to the Central American country, the organisation's head Jan Egeland spoke to ""people whose suffering was on the level with what you would find in any armed conflict"". Entire communities were being forcibly displaced by gangs, he said. He urged governments around the world not to neglect the crisis. Mr Egeland said that the number of killings in Honduras - as well as in neighbouring Guatemala and El Salvador - was on par with that in armed conflicts, turning thousands of people into refugees. Women in particular often become victims of sexual violence and femicides there, with an average of one woman murdered every 28 hours. Children are not immune to gang violence either. Mr Egeland told the BBC that he visited a school in the city of La Lima, which had seen student numbers drop from 5,000 to 1,200 over the past five years. ""There's been a catastrophic drop out. Students either migrate north [to the US] or they are too afraid to even attend school, they stay home out of fear of being recruited by armed gangs."" He said he had met one family whose 13-year-old son had been approached by a gang. When the father forbade the boy to join, the family was given 24 hours to leave their home. ""They went into hiding with the NRC,"" Mr Egeland, whose organisation provides shelters for those fleeing violence as well as funding for schools, said. Many pupils, he explained, could not afford to attend classes because their families relied on them to go out to earn money for food. While Honduras has long been suffering from wide-spread gang violence, many people there have also contended with the aftermath of two almost back-to-back hurricanes that hit in November 2020. Read: Hurricanes leave Hondurans homeless and destitute According to the NRC, 3.2m people are in need of aid in Honduras alone, with many requiring both protection and food assistance. Mr Egeland praised the Honduran government for introducing a law supporting internally displaced people, but he warned that this legislation needed ""financial and diplomatic support from the outside world"" to be implemented effectively.

Sudan violence: Scottish family tells of gunshots at their door," A terrified Scottish family have told of the gunshots at their door, as they try to flee the violence in Sudan. Amar Osman from Dunfermline, who is visiting relatives near Khartoum, said the situation was ""very scary"". The Red Cross said people were making ""desperate attempts"" to escape after more than a week of fighting there. The UK government evacuated embassy staff in an operation at the weekend, but said it had ""severely limited"" ability to extract British citizens. Mr Osman was with his wife Fatma Giha in Omdurman, near Khartoum, when the crisis started. ""They were running along my street last night shooting and chasing people,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""We locked all of the doors and went right in the middle of the house. ""There's people now robbing and taking chances since there's no police or armies. ""People are going into houses with guns and taking everything: phones, money, shoes. It's getting very wild."" A power struggle between Sudan's regular army and a powerful paramilitary force has led to violence across the country for more than a week. Electricity is scarce and food and water supplies are running out for many. The family registered for help from the UK government, but said days had passed with no response. Ms Giha, who is a consultant for the World Health Organisation, said the family had hoped for ""some arrangement to be made"" with the British embassy. She said: ""No-one contacted us, despite the fact that other countries have already evacuated their people from Sudan and are working on this, like the Canadians and Turkish."" Without government support, the family attempted to escape to Egypt via bus. The private organisers asked for nearly seven times the normal journey price - but the bus did not arrive. Mr Osman said: ""We'll try other companies and buses. ""But there's no fuel for these buses and if you get some, they'll ask for a lot of money for it. ""We'll just have to lock up the doors and sit and wait and see what happens."" Meanwhile, Donald Gillies from Islay has urged the government to do more to help British nationals such as his niece Jennifer, who is stranded in Khartoum with her Sudanese husband and their children. Mr Gillies said Jennifer went to her teaching job one day and the next day the airport was bombed. ""It's pretty desperate,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""They're running low on food and water. They took the government advice and hunkered down. ""They moved out of the initial area in which the fighting was quite heavy and moved into another house in the suburbs. ""I imagine fighting would be spreading into the area quite soon. So they feel abandoned."" Mr Gillies said his local MP Brendan O'Hara had been in touch with the family, but there had been no direct contact with the Foreign Office. ""The British government has done everything they can to remove the British government employees, and they have left the civilians behind,"" he said. ""And that is pretty shameful in my opinion. There must have been intel that this crisis was going to kick off."" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has said relocated embassy staff would continue to support British nationals in Sudan. The UK government has been approached for comment. ",551,uk,2023-04-24T17:36:32.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-65371290
First Republic Bank: More than $100bn of withdrawals this year," First Republic Bank customers pulled more than $100bn (£80bn) from their accounts in the first three months of the year amid concerns about the health of the global banking system. The US bank says its deposits fell by over 40% since the end of December. It comes after Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse yesterday revealed the scale of the bank run that triggered its state-backed rescue last month. A series of bank collapses have raised fears of a crisis in the sector. ""With the closure of several banks in March, we experienced unprecedented deposit outflows,"" First Republic's chief financial officer, Neal Holland, said. ""We are working to restructure our balance sheet and reduce our expenses and short-term borrowings,"" he added. First Republic also said it planned to cut costs by shedding 20% to 25% of its workforce in the coming months. Shares in the bank fell by more than 20% in extended trading in New York after it made the announcement. Last month, a group of major US banks injected $30bn into First Republic, which had been seen as at risk of failure. US regulators called the move ""most welcome"" while the banks, led by JP Morgan and Citigroup, said the action reflected their ""confidence"". Problems in the banking sector surfaced in the US earlier last month when Silicon Valley Bank, which was the country's 16th-largest lender, collapsed in the biggest failure of a US bank since 2008. That was followed two days later by the failure of New York's Signature Bank. Authorities stepped in to guarantee deposits beyond typical limits in an effort to head off further runs on bank deposits. On Monday, European banking giant Credit Suisse said 61.2bn Swiss francs ($69bn; £55.2bn) had left the bank in the first three months of the year. The announcement came in what were expected to be its last financial results, ahead of the completion of its forced sale to rival UBS. Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - have sharply increased interest rates as they try to curb inflation. The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower. This contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and has raised questions about the situation at other firms.

NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell out after claim of misconduct," NBCUniversal chief executive Jeff Shell has left the US media and entertainment giant following an allegation against him of sexual harassment, its parent company has said. His departure comes after an outside firm conducted an investigation over a complaint about Mr Shell's conduct. The network's parent company Comcast initially said he was let go over an ""inappropriate relationship"". The executive has apologised following his removal. ""I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret,"" Mr Shell said in a statement. ""I'm truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down."" Comcast has not yet said who will be the new NBCUniversal boss. The parent company said in a statement on Sunday that it had ""mutually agreed that Mr Shell will depart effective immediately"" following the investigation into his alleged conduct. The probe was led by outside counsel, Comcast said, and was launched after a harassment complaint was filed against Mr Shell by an employee for a Comcast-owned channel. ""The investigation into Mr Shell arose from a complaint by my client of sexual harassment and sex discrimination,"" Suzanne McKie, a London-based lawyer for the staff member, told the Wall Street Journal. The BBC is not naming the accuser to protect her privacy. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Comcast said the probe had uncovered evidence of sexual harassment. NBCUniversal's senior executives will report directly to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh until a successor for Mr Shell is found. ""We built this company on a culture of integrity. Nothing is more important than how we treat each other,"" Mr Cavanagh and Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said in a company-wide email seen by the BBC. ""When our principles and policies are violated, we will always move quickly to take appropriate action, as we have done here,"" they added. The company is home to NBC, which is one of America's biggest television networks, business news channel CNBC, and major Hollywood film studio Universal Pictures. Mr Shell, who is married, has been at the company for almost two decades and took over as NBCUniversal chief executive in January 2020 - months later, much of the world shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic. Lockdowns forced the closure of theme parks and cinemas, while film and television productions were halted. During his tenure, he launched a shakeup of the company, with the aim to make its streaming business and traditional TV operations work more closely together. As well as owning NBCUniversal, Comcast's operations also include Europe's largest pay-TV broadcaster Sky Group. ",421,business,2023-04-25T02:13:09.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65370382
Cost of living: What payments are available and how do you claim?," Millions of people are now receiving the next round of payments to help with rising bills, as a committee of MPs investigate the fairness of the scheme. Low-income households, pensioners and some disabled people will receive additional cost-of-living funds following an extension to the scheme from last year. MPs are studying whether the design of the payments system has supported those most in need. Some groups will receive payments to help with higher bills, including: The first instalment of £301 for those on means-tested benefits will be made between 25 April and 17 May. The payment, in three instalments, is available to households who receive the following benefits: The payment reference on a recipient's bank account will be their national insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only tax credits, rather than any of the other benefits, may be paid slightly later than others, starting on 2 May. People are not eligible for these payments if they receive New Style Employment and Support Allowance, contributory Employment and Support Allowance, or New Style Jobseeker's Allowance - unless they get Universal Credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, or report it here. To qualify for the next instalment, people had to have claimed a benefits payment between 26 January and 25 February 2023, or received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner households do not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. Other eligibility details are outlined here. None of these cost-of-living payments affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive. Two payments totalling £650 have been made to more than eight million low-income households. The first instalment of £326 was paid between 14 and 31 July. The second instalment of £324 should have reached those eligible by the end of December. Payments of £300 were also paid to pensioners during the winter just gone, and a £150 payment was also made last year to those with disabilities. Some people would have received all of those payments, if they were eligible. Everyone's energy bill was cut by at least £400 during last winter. This was applied over six months, with a £66 reduction in October and November, and a £67 discount every month between December and March. The discount was made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales. However, there are no plans so far for this to be repeated next winter. Separate arrangements were made for households in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. They are receiving a single payment of £600 starting in January, which is higher than the rest of the UK because a higher proportion of households use heating oil. Direct debit customers in Northern Ireland are having the money paid into their bank accounts. Other customers will be sent a voucher. Up to six million people on the following disability benefits will receive another £150 later in the year: Households that receive the Winter Fuel Payment - which is worth £200-£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - should have received an extra £300 in November or December. That should cover nearly all pensioners across the UK. Another additional cost-of-living payment of £300 will be made next winter, Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit receive the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits. This means a small group of pensioners with disabilities have already received a total of £1,500, with more to come. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee is studying whether cost-of-living payments have been received everyone in need of help. They are studying whether some have missed out on hundreds of pounds because they are just outside the qualifying criteria, and whether the package as a whole is sufficient for low-income families. The evidence being considered by the committee includes the views of the public. A £150 rebate, often through people's council tax bill, was made last year. The payment method depended on whether you pay your council tax by direct debit and where you live in the UK. Some people were given fuel vouchers through the Household Support Fund, which is distributed by local councils. The government launched an Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022, which limits a typical duel-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500. It is not a cap on how much customers actually pay - your bill depends on how much energy you actually use. The scheme was initially designed to last for two years, but was then reduced to six months. However, the government has confirmed the guarantee will continue until July. The plan applies to all households in England, Scotland and Wales, but in Northern Ireland a typical bill is lower. The government also announced a scheme to cut energy bills for businesses, which ended at the end of March. Under a new scheme that began in April, firms get a discount on wholesale prices rather than costs being capped as under the previous deal. Heavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, get a larger discount than others. How is the rising cost of living affecting you?

Millions start to get latest cost-of-living payment," Low-income households are now starting to receive the latest cost-of-living payment from the government to tackle ongoing high bills. Eight million means-tested benefits claimants, including people on Universal Credit, should receive the £301 instalment between now and 17 May. Further almost identical payments will come in the autumn and next spring. All will be transferred automatically. The payments come as food prices rise at their fastest rate for 45 years. The cost of the supermarket shop has kept inflation - the rate of rising prices - stubbornly high in the UK. A typical household's energy bill also remains at £2,500 a year, although all of these bills are expected to drop later in the year. Cost-of-living payments were originally introduced to help struggling families cope with the soaring cost of gas and electricity. Two payments totalling £650 were made last year. However, they were never exclusively targeted at these bills, and households could always spend the money as they saw fit. Many are likely to use the latest instalment to cover the cost of putting food on the table. The latest £301 will be paid directly into eligible recipients' bank accounts, without the need to make a claim. The payment reference for bank accounts will be the recipient's National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. Those who qualify for the money solely through tax credits will receive their cost-of-living payment from 2 May. In addition, during the summer, more than six million people with disabilities will get an extra £150. During next winter, over eight million pensioners will receive an extra £300. To qualify for a payment, you must receive one of Universal Credit, Income-based Jobseekers Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, or Pension Credit. You will need to have been entitled to a payment for one of these benefits between 26 January and 25 February 2023, or payment for an assessment period ending between these dates. Low-income pensioners who are eligible for, but not claiming Pension Credit, can still qualify for the cost-of-living payment if they make a successful backdated Pension Credit application by 19 May. Many households will be using less gas during the coming warmer months, and the lights will be on less during the longer days. That, for some, will mean lower bills, although the difference is generally smoothed out for those who pay for energy via direct debit. The likelihood is that bills could fall in the summer, as lower wholesale energy costs paid by suppliers feed through to consumers. Here are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips.

CBI hired 'toxic' staff and failed to sack offenders," The UK's biggest business group has admitted it hired ""culturally toxic"" staff and failed to fire people who sexually harassed female colleagues. The CBI said a failure to act allowed a ""very small minority"" of staff to believe they could get away with harassment or violence against women. The embattled lobby group said it has now dismissed a number of people. The CBI was responding to an independent law firm report on misconduct allegations including rape. In an emotional letter to members, the business lobby group - which claims to represent 190,000 firms - admitted to a series of failings and said it had made mistakes ""that led to terrible consequences"". It said there was a collective ""sense of shame"" at ""so badly having let down the...people who came to work at the CBI"". ""Our collective failure to completely protect vulnerable employees... and to put in place proper mechanisms to rapidly escalate incidents of this nature to senior leadership.... these failings most of all drive the shame,"" CBI president Brian McBride said in the letter. In early April, a number of claims of misconduct and harassment against CBI staff emerged including one allegation of rape at the lobby group's summer party in 2019. On Friday a second rape allegation emerged, after a woman told the Guardian she was raped whilst working at one of the CBI's overseas offices. Both rape allegations are being investigated by the police. In a letter following a report by law firm Fox Williams, which was appointed to lead an independent investigation into the lobby group, the CBI admitted to its members: The future of the CBI is hanging in the balance and it has suspended its operations until June while it tries to reform its workplace. There has been a mass exodus of CBI members, with a number of household names including John Lewis, BMW, Virgin Media O2, insurers Aviva, Zurich and Phoenix Group, banking firm Natwest, credit card company Mastercard; B&Q owner Kingfisher and media firm ITV all quitting the group. The government had already decided to pause any activity with the lobby group, but on Monday, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said there was ""no point"" engaging with the CBI when its own members had deserted them. ""We want to engage with a body that speaks or business. It is incredibly important for me when I'm constructing budgets to have someone that I can turn to who speaks for British business."" Mr McBride said he wanted to give members reasons to consider trusting the lobby group again. But said: ""Whether that is possible, I simply don't know."" Mr McBride said he was concerned that CBI staff felt that their only option was to go to the Guardian newspaper - which first published the claims - instead of feeling confident enough to raise the matter internally. One female CBI worker had told the Guardian that she had been stalked by a male colleague in 2018. The business group upheld a complaint of harassment against the man however, he was allowed to keep working in the same office as the woman. He eventually left for an unrelated reasons, according to the newspaper. Earlier this month, the lobby group fired its director-general, Tony Danker, who joined the CBI in 2020, following separate complaints of workplace misconduct. Mr Danker acknowledged he had made some staff feel ""very uncomfortable"" and apologised, but said his name had been wrongly associated with separate claims andthat his reputation had been ""destroyed"". He is being replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's former chief economist, who is returning to the lobby group after a brief stint at Barclays. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn was the director-general of the CBI between 2015 and 2020. The BBC has contacted her for comment. Mr McBride said the CBI had accepted all 35 recommendations made by Fox Williams investigators and added the organisation had 60 days to produce an action plan for its members to vote one. The CBI's president said the organisation had to ""go for a much more zero-tolerance culture"" and get ""much more severe in dealing"" with incidents of bullying and sexual harassment. ""For us it's about rebuilding the trust that we obviously lost with the members who left us,"" he said. But Andy Wood, chief executive of the brewing company Adnams, which has cancelled its membership of the CBI, said he had not heard anything so far that ""reassures me that I should become a member of the CBI again"". He said he was not sure if the group was ""salvageable"". ""Zero tolerance of bullying and sexual harassment - that has to be a given in a modern organisation,"" Mr Wood said. ""It just shows really how archaic the CBI was behind the scenes. I applaud them for trying to put their house in order but this does feel [like] a few things being done far too late.""

Disney cuts more jobs as restructuring continues," Walt Disney Co has begun a second round of layoffs as part of an earlier announced restructuring expected to result in 7,000 job losses. The media giant has been under pressure as its traditional television and film business shrinks, while its streaming unit continues to post big losses. Chief executive Bob Iger announced the $5.5bn cost-cutting drive in February. This week's cuts are expected to bringing the total number of reductions so far to 4,000. The losses will fall across the company, including at sports channel ESPN and film studios. The firm has said frontline workers at the park are not expected to be affected. ""The difficult reality of many colleagues and friends leaving Disney is not something we take lightly,"" Disney officials said. The redundancies are indicative of a larger retrenching across the entertainment industry, as executives refocus on profits, after years in which many traditional media firms spent heavily to launch streaming platforms and win subscribers. Mr Iger, Disney's longtime boss who returned to the company in November after the ousting of Bob Chapek, has said the firm needed to streamline its business. Among other measures, the firm is planning to spend $3bn less on content. The 7,000 in redundancies announced in February amount to about 3% of the 220,000-person workforce the company employed as of 1 October. The firm commenced its job cuts with a first round of notifications to staff at the end of last month. Another ""several thousand"" people are expected to learn if they are losing their jobs this week, with a third wave of cuts planned for this summer, the company said. Among the people affected by the cuts this week was ESPN spokesperson Mike Soltys, who had worked for the company for more than four decades. ""My final statement as ESPN Spokesperson: '43 Amazing Years. Wow. We wish him well.'"" Mr Soltys joked on Twitter. Disney, which employs more than 50,000 people outside the US, did not respond to an inquiry about how many of the job cuts would involve international staff.

Prezzo to close a third of its restaurants as bills rise," Italian restaurant chain Prezzo will shut a third of its restaurants after being hit by rising costs for pizza and pasta ingredients and energy. The group said closing the 46 loss-making sites will put 810 staff at risk of redundancy. It said its utility bills had more than doubled in the past year along with sharp rises in costs for dough balls, pizza sauce, mozzarella and spaghetti. The cuts will affect sites with footfall still below pre-Covid levels. Prezzo said it would keep its restaurants in busier shopping areas, such as retail parks and tourist destinations. Covid restrictions at the height of the pandemic forced many hospitality businesses to shut their doors and furlough staff. The financial recovery for thousands of pubs, bars, restaurants and other venues has since been hampered by rising costs, especially for energy. Prezzo, which went into administration in late 2020 before being bought by private equity firm Cain International, said the cuts affected restaurants where ""the post-Covid recovery has proved harder than we had hoped"". Staff were informed about the closures on Monday morning and the chain said it would work to redeploy ""as many staff internally as possible"". ""The last three years have been some of the hardest times I have ever seen for the High Street,"" said Dean Challenger, chief executive of Prezzo. ""The reality is that the cost-of-living crisis, the changing face of the high street and soaring inflation has made it impossible to keep all our restaurants operating profitably,"" he added. As well as energy bills, Prezzo said its ""core ingredients"" had soared, with dough ball costs rising 15%, pizza sauce shooting up 28% and spaghetti jumping 40%. The company added ""double-digit wage inflation"" had also hit its finances. Mr Dean said the ""tough decisions"" had been made to ""ensure Prezzo can continue serving communities with high-quality, accessible Italian-inspired meals for many more years to come"". Other restaurant chains have announced cuts due to the impact of the pandemic and inflation, with the owner of Frankie and Benny's and Chiquito closing 35 restaurants in March on top of previous closures in 2020. Zizzi, Ask Italian, Pizza Express and Pizza Hut have also closed sites in recent years, while Prezzo announced it would shut 94 restaurants in 2018.

£55bn withdrawn from Credit Suisse before rescue," Credit Suisse has revealed the scale of the bank run that triggered its state-backed rescue in March. The Swiss banking giant said 61.2bn Swiss francs (£55.2bn; $68.6bn) left the bank in the first three months of the year. It came as the lender reported what are expected to be its last ever financial results. Its forced sale to rival Swiss bank UBS is expected to be completed soon. Credit Suisse's flagship wealth management division saw the amount of assets it managed drop to 502.5bn francs at the end of March, almost 29% lower than the same period last year, Credit Suisse said in a statement. ""These outflows have moderated but have not yet reversed as of April 24, 2023,"" it added. Credit Suisse clients started pulling money out of the bank after it was caught up in the market turmoil that followed the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US in March. In Switzerland, authorities put together a rescue package for Credit Suisse. It included more than 200bn francs of financial guarantees and saw UBS agree to take over Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse had been loss-making and had faced a string of problems in recent years, including money laundering charges. It reported a loss of 7.3bn Swiss francs in 2022 - its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 - and had warned it did not expect to be profitable until 2024. Commenting on the latest results, Frances Coppola, an independent banking analyst, told the the BBC's Today programme that Credit Suisse had also seen billions withdrawn in the final three months of 2022. ""Then of course this quarter's [withdrawals] came on top of that. And banks don't survive outflows like that, they really don't, however big they are."" Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth Investments, said the given the bank's size, the outflows were ""going to be a big number"". ""If anything today we've got confirmation of what UBS has bought."" The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US came after the value of assets they held fell sharply as a result of rising interest rates. Banking shares around the world fell sharply amid worries that other lenders might face similar problems, and investors rushed to pull their money out of the already struggling Credit Suisse. Since then concerns about other banks have eased, but Ms Coppola said others could still face difficulties. ""I think we are going to see more banking turbulence. Whether it will affect the very big banks like this I don't know."" Swiss prosecutors have opened an investigation into the sudden takeover of Credit Suisse, which was the country's second-largest bank. The deal has angered taxpayers and shareholders of both banks, who were deprived of a vote on the takeover. Some have also argued it has damaged Switzerland's global reputation as a financial centre. The deal, when it was announced, valued Credit Suisse at $3.15bn (£2.6bn), whereas on the Friday before the settlement was reached it had been valued at about $8bn.

Bed Bath & Beyond files for bankruptcy in the US," Embattled retail giant Bed Bath & Beyond has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in US. The company says it will ""implement an orderly wind down of its business"", including its Buy Buy Baby brand, and close all 475 of its remaining stores by the end of June. It added that it was seeking buyers for some or all of its assets. The chain, which has faced financial troubles for years, recently said it would cut jobs and close 150 stores. Last month, the company announced that it would sell $300m (£241.1m) worth of its shares, and warned that it might have to file for bankruptcy if the funds were not secured. The once-popular destination for household goods has struggled to keep up with the rise of online shopping. Chapter 11 protection postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, giving it time to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business. In a filing to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey on Sunday, the retailer said ""the past twelve months have undoubtedly been the most difficult and turbulent in Bed Bath & Beyond's storied history."" It added that despite ""painstaking, creative, and exhaustive efforts to right the ship along the way, Bed Bath & Beyond is simply unable to service its funded debt obligations while simultaneously supplying sufficient inventory to its store locations."" Notices on the Bed Bath & Beyond and Buy Buy Baby websites said the stores ""remain open to serve you"", without offering a timeline for when services will cease. ""Millions of customers have trusted us through the most important milestones in their lives - from going to college to getting married, settling into a new home to having a baby,"" Bed Bath & Beyond president and chief executive Sue Gove said in a statement. The company also said it had secured $240m in financing from the Texas-based Sixth Street Specialty Lending to support its winding down process. Bed Bath & Beyond was founded in 1971 as Bed 'n Bath, in a nod to the narrow range of merchandise it originally sold. Over the years the company hugely expanded the goods it had on offer to include everything from bed linen to electric appliances. At its peak in the 2010s, Bed Bath & Beyond was the largest home furnishing retailer in the US, with more than 970 stores across all 50 states. However, in recent years it has struggled with dwindling profits as more customers chose to shop online. Earlier this year, the company said that it had secured more than $500m in new financing, but added that it would close 150 stores and cut jobs in an attempt to turn the business around.

New Gateshead Quayside plan images revealed," Images of revised plans for a huge development on Gateshead's Quayside have been revealed. The multimillion-pound complex was approved in late 2020 but spiralling prices have meant it had to be redesigned. The cost of the 12,500-capacity arena and an international conference centre has risen from an estimated £260m to £330m. A new planning application for the complex has been submitted by developers Ask Patrizia. Planning consultants Lichfields said ""operational and constructional requirements"" meant the planned hotel would be replaced by a ""linear park"". This would run along the east of the site, it said. There would also be ""minor design amendments"" to the previously approved indoor arena and conference and exhibition centre, the firm added. It had already been announced the hotel, which had been described as ""monstrously overbearing"", will now be built behind the arena. Increasing prices have seen the cost of the project spiral from an estimated £260m to £330, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Gateshead Council succeeded at the second attempt in securing a £20m Levelling Up grant from the Government to help cover the mounting costs. The new application is expected to be considered by the local authority’s planning committee in the summer with building work potentially starting in the autumn. Lichfields said the new development would provide ""a critical mass of cultural and business facilities"" on the river frontage. The arena, exhibition space and public areas would link ""buildings, leisure and retail into one holistic environment”, the firm said.

TransPennine Express worst for train cancellations," Train operator TransPennine Express (TPE) cancelled around one in six of its services in the four weeks to the end of March, new figures show. The regulator said the cancellation rate leapt from 5.8% to 17% when trains cancelled up to 10pm the night before due to staff shortages were included. It was the highest in the country, but down on the 23.8% cancellation rate in the previous period to 4 March. TPE says cancellations have come down after it put a recovery plan in place. The troubled company's current contract ends next month. The Transport Secretary has insisted he has not yet decided whether to renew it. The operator, which runs services across the North of England and into Scotland, has been criticised for months of poor performance. It has struggled to deliver all its planned services, amid staff shortages it has blamed on staff sickness and a training backlog, and amid poor industrial relations. The Labour Party, regional mayors and some MPs have said TPE's contract should be removed. Rowan Burnett, who travels on TPE's trains from his home in Marsden, West Yorkshire to work in Manchester, told the BBC in January that regular cancellations and delays were a source of daily stress. This week, he said: ""I would love to tell you a positive story or a turnaround in the last quarter, but no it hasn't improved. ""I still wake up every day, check my phone, see the swathe of red across my cancelled trains. Then I have to make the best of the commute one way and then hopefully back home."" Mr Burnett wants to use the train as it is more sustainable, but feels trust has been eroded because he is not confident he can be in the right place at the right time. He said whichever company ran the service needed to be held accountable. ""I personally can't carry on like this"", he added. On Wednesday, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the current level of service had been ""unacceptable"", and if he thought TPE was not capable of improving, ""no option is off the table"". He told the Transport Select Committee he had to make a decision that was ""legally defensible"" by examining all of the evidence about the service and the ""capacity of the company to improve those services"". In January, TPE's managing director admitted to the BBC services had not been good enough, and said the company had a recovery plan to do better. For the third month in a row, figures from the Office of Road and Rail show TPE used pre-planned cancellations - also called P-coding advance cancellations - because of a lack of available staff more than any other operator in Britain. However, it has cut its use of ""P-coding"" when not enough staff are available by nearly half. A spokesperson for TransPennine Express said: ""We introduced our recovery plan at the beginning of February to reduce cancellations and provide greater reliability and stability for our customers. ""As a direct result of this plan, we have seen a 40% reduction in cancellations, and continue to work to bring these numbers down in the coming weeks and months."" The overall rate of cancellations at train companies across Britain rose from 3.3% to 3.7% for the same period.

CBI suspends key activities after rape and sex assault allegations," The CBI is suspending key activities until June after a number of firms quit the business group following allegations of rape and sexual assault. Dozens of firms have announced they are leaving the group or pausing their membership after new allegations about misconduct at the organisation. A second woman claimed she was raped by CBI colleagues in a Guardian article on Friday. The CBI said it ""shares the shock and revulsion"" at the alleged events. The board of the lobbying group said it wanted to talk to ""colleagues, members, experts and stakeholders"" to get their opinion on the CBI's future role and purpose. ""As a result, we have taken the difficult but necessary decision to suspend all policy and membership activity until an extraordinary general meeting in June,"" the board said in a statement. The board will put forward proposals at that meeting ""for a refocused CBI"", it said, adding that ""this work and the cultural reform will be the entire and urgent focus of the organisation over the coming weeks."" Despite membership operations being suspended until June, firms will still be free to quit if they choose, the BBC understands. The City of London Police was investigating an alleged rape at a CBI summer party in 2019 before the Guardian reported the second incident. Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Waight from the City of London Police said no arrests had been made and investigations were continuing, and asked anyone with information to get in touch. The brewer Adnams is among the dozens of firms that left the CBI on Friday following the recent allegations. Chief executive Andy Wood told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the CBI brand was ""beyond repair"", and it would have to ""reinvent itself root and branch"". He pointed to the CBI's role in helping to design the furlough scheme, which paid part of workers' wages during the pandemic, as one of its great successes. But Adnams is a member of two industry-specific trade associations that can also speak on its behalf. ""It may be that there's a need for those trade associations and business groups to come together on an ad hoc basis, if we were ever faced with something like the pandemic or something that affects the whole of industry, but I do think that people like the British Beer and Pub Association or UK Hospitality do a great job. So let's see where that leads us."" Vice president of the CBI, Lord Karan Bilimoria, told the BBC he was determined to put things right following the allegations. Speaking to the Today programme, he said ""mistakes have been made"", adding there will be a ""complete review of the culture, one-to-one sessions with every employee in the organisation... So we reset completely and learn from all the mistakes"". Retailer John Lewis also quit the lobbying organisation, which claims to represent 190,000 companies. John Lewis said it made the decision ""due to the further very serious and ongoing allegations"". Other firms that have quit include: BMW, Virgin Media O2, Vodafone, insurers Aviva, Zurich and Phoenix Group, banking firm Natwest, credit card company Mastercard; B&Q owner Kingfisher; media firm ITV; insurance marketplace Lloyds of London; investment firm Schroders; auditor EY; catering giant Compass and consultants Accenture. The Association of British Insurers has also left, as has Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers. Organisations that have suspended membership include: pharmaceutical giants GSK and AstraZeneca; airports operator Heathrow; retailers Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, and Marks & Spencer; banking group Santander; National Grid, Octopus Energy and Scottish Power; drinks giant Diageo; Rolls Royce; Unilever; BT; property company British Land; accountancy giant PwC; Manpower Group; British Beer and Pub Association; Shell and BP; Nissan; Royal Mail; Uber; Facebook owner Meta; Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment; Nurofen maker Reckitt; and FTSE 100 hotel group IHG which owns Holiday Inn. The government had already announced that it was pausing its engagement with the business group. Last week the British Insurance Brokers' Association said it had withdrawn its membership ""in light of recent reports"". The CBI - which employs more than 300 people - has been in crisis since allegations of a rape at one of its summer parties in 2019 and other sexual misconduct at the organisation emerged earlier this month. Three employees have been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation by law firm Fox Williams. The group's director-general was dismissed over separate complaints. For nearly 60 years, the CBI has tried to project the image of business as a force for good. It has lobbied government in the interests of member firms while promoting and sharing best practice among them. But currently its future is in real doubt. Until Friday, most membership-paying firms had said they would wait for the results of an independent investigation into allegations of misconduct at CBI events - including rape and drug use - before deciding their relationship with the organisation. But a second allegation of rape in an overseas CBI office started a trickle that turned into a flood of businesses suspending or cancelling their membership. The CBI has tried to move at pace, announcing it is fast-tracking the return of former chief economist Rain Newton-Smith to take up the post of director general. But on Friday it acknowledged the gravity of the exodus and announced it would suspend all membership activity until an emergency general meeting in June. It's unclear how much difference the findings of the Fox Williams report, expected early next week, will make to a shocked membership and a cautious government which has also suspended engagement. And bear in mind, given the seriousness of the allegations, the police have started their own investigation and it is not a given that members - or indeed the government - will re-engage with a criminal investigation hanging over some employees. Make no mistake, the future of an organisation which has described itself as ""the voice of business"" in the UK is in serious doubt this weekend. A source close to employees at the CBI said the crisis of the past few weeks had taken an ""emotional toll"" on staff. ""At first there was relief that people were talking about it,"" the source said. ""It felt as though taking it public was holding management to account."" ""But now, as darker allegations have come out, this has been hard on the staff."" The source said there had been ""an avalanche"" of members resigning and that staff are concerned about their jobs. ""They're worried about whether the business will still be here tomorrow,"" the source said. Staff will continue to work and be paid as normal until at least June, the BBC understands.

Johnny Depp's Pirates hat stars in Luton exhibition," A town that was the centre of the British hat-making industry is to showcase the importance of its heritage in an international exhibition. Hats Made Me, in Luton, features more than 200 exhibits, including a red visor worn by Beyoncé and Johnny Depp's Pirates of The Caribbean hat. Samuel Javid, creative director of The Culture Trust, said it was ""one of the largest exhibitions of this kind"". It aimed to show ""how relevant headwear still is"" and runs until 10 December. Mr Javid said: ""It's an incredibly big deal, not just locally, but nationally and internationally. ""This is probably the most ambitious thing we've done with our museum collections."" The exhibition, at the Stockwood Discovery Centre, will feature hats and headwear through the years and includes creations by renowned milliner Philip Treacy. The organisers are hoping for 50,000 visitors. ""We put together hats and headwear dating all the way back from 19th Century straw policemen's, hats that were plaited together locally, to whimsical, wonderful costumes from stage and screen,"" Mr Javid added. ""It really is a collection that shows how influential hats and headwear are globally."" ""This exhibition is a great nod to that heritage, but definitely a step into contemporary fashion, contemporary purpose, contemporary use, and demonstrating why hats and headwear are just a thing of the past in Luton, but how they're globally significant now."" Diversity will be celebrated, showcasing the town's different cultures. He said Jewish prayer caps, Sikh turbans, Ghanaian head-dresses and Irish communion veils can also been seen. They have come from its own collection and items donated by the community. Yona Lesger, exhibition curator, said: ""Luton really was the centre of British hat-making. ""In the second half of the 19th Century and start of the 20th Century, the highest percentage of people worked in the town in the hat industry, compared to any other part of the country."" In the early 1800s there were ""400 factories all related to the hat industry"", which also gave the town's professional football club its nickname of The Hatters. Luton became known for its straw hats, as the material grown in The Chilterns was light coloured and more pliable. ""Until the introduction of Vauxhall in the early 20th Century, the hat industry was the reason that Luton was so prosperous and so many immigrants from across the world came to find jobs here,"" Ms Lesger added. Mr Javid said Luton was still the place to come for a hat. ""Celebrities from all across the world come here, because the expertise is still here, going back generations and generations."" Mr Javid said manufacturers still remained in the town. ""It's now up to all of us to get excited by hats and wear them, to make sure these manufacturing skills continue.""

UK sandwich chain Pret A Manger launches in India," UK-based coffee and sandwich chain Pret A Manger has become the latest high-profile Western brand to launch in the Indian market. The firm opened its first shop in India's financial hub Mumbai on Friday. It comes in the same week that US technology giant Apple launched its first two stores in the country. Pret said last year that it was partnering with a unit of Reliance Industries, which is owned by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani. Pret's chief executive Pano Christou said its offering in the country will reflect the company's brand ""while also adapting to local preferences and food habits"". It marks the first venture by Reliance Brands, which also owns India's biggest retail chain, into the country's growing food and drinks industry. Reliance said its first outlet is a recreation of Pret's UK shops. The shops will be aimed at ""the new Indian consumer"", Darshan Mehta, the managing director of Reliance Brands said. The launch came just days after Apple chief executive Tim Cook opened the iPhone maker's first retail store in India. The opening of the store in the financial centre Mumbai on Tuesday was followed by a second outlet in the capital Delhi on Thursday. On its opening day, Pret's Mumbai shop was largely stocked with its staple UK menu, but it also added a few local flavours - like the Bombay Toastie and a spicy paneer and lima bean soup. ""It's been a bit chaotic here since we came, maybe because of it being the first day. But it's quite similar to the London stores I have been to,"" Hemlataa P, a fashion consultant, told the BBC. Most menu items will also not contain meat, to cater to India's large vegetarian population. ""The hot meal brought memories of my time in London. But I missed the cheddar and pickle baguette - it's not served today,"" said a customer who works in the neighbourhood. Pret A Manger, which means ""ready to eat"" in French, was founded in London in 1983, with the first shop opening the following year. After the original company went into liquidation the brand was bought by college friends Sinclair Beecham and Julian Metcalfe, with their first store opening in 1986. The brand currently has 400 outlets around the world, across nine markets including the UK, US, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Reliance Brands operates more than 2,000 outlets across India. In 2021, parent company Reliance Retail announced a franchise deal with the US-headquartered convenience store chain 7-Eleven. The deal helped to cement Reliance's position as India's largest bricks and mortar retailer. Mr Ambani has a personal fortune of around $84bn (£67.5bn), according to Forbes magazine. The 66-year-old's late father Dhirubhai Ambani founded a textile manufacturer that would eventually become Reliance Industries. It is now one of India's largest conglomerates - with businesses including petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail. Mr Ambani is the chairman of Reliance Industries. The Ambani family has a 49% stake in the company. The family also owns assets in the UK worth tens of millions of pounds. In 2019, a unit of Reliance Industries bought the iconic UK toy retailer Hamleys for an undisclosed sum. Two years later, Reliance bought the historic British country club Stoke Park for £57m.

John Lewis and other major firms quit CBI after second rape claim," A number of major firms, including John Lewis, have left the CBI after a second allegation of rape at the business lobby group emerged. The Guardian reported that a woman who was working at one of the CBI's overseas offices was sexually assaulted by two male colleagues. It also reported an allegation of stalking by a CBI employee. The CBI said the latest allegations were ""abhorrent"" and that it had previously been unaware of the claims. A number of firms said they were cancelling their memberships with the business lobbying giant - which claims to represent 190,000 firms - while others said they were suspending activity with the group. John Lewis said it made the decision to quit membership of the CBI ""due to the further very serious and ongoing allegations"". Virgin Media O2 said the ""disturbing allegations and the way the situation has been handled is not representative of business in Britain."" Firms that have quit the CBI include: John Lewis, BMW, Virgin Media O2, insurers Aviva, Zurich and Phoenix Group, banking firm Natwest, credit card company Mastercard;  B&Q owner Kingfisher; media firm ITV; insurance marketplace Lloyds of London; investment firm Schroders; and auditor EY. The Association of British Insurers has also left, as has Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers. Companies that have suspended membership include: pharmaceutical giants GSK and AstraZeneca; airports operator Heathrow; retailers Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, and Marks & Spencer; banking group Santander; National Grid, Octopus Energy and Scottish Power; drinks giant Diageo; Rolls Royce; Unilever; BT; property company British Land; accountancy giant PwC; and Manpower Group. Shell and BP are understood to have also paused membership of CBI. The government had already announced that it was pausing its engagement with the business group. Last week the British Insurance Brokers' Association said it had withdrawn its membership ""in light of recent reports"". The CBI, which employs more than 300 people, has been in crisis since allegations of a rape at a CBI summer party in 2019 and other sexual misconduct at the organisation emerged earlier this month. Three employees have been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation by law firm Fox Williams. The group's director-general was dismissed over separate complaints. Brian McBride, president of the CBI, said the group had not been previously aware of the most serious allegations and it was working closely with ""the police to help ensure any perpetrators are brought to justice."" ""Our hearts go out to any women who have been victims of the behaviour described,"" he said, adding that it was ""vital"" that the incidents be ""thoroughly investigated"". The City of London Police was already investigating an alleged rape at a CBI summer party in 2019, before the Guardian reported a second incident. Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Waight from the City of London Police said that no arrests had been made and its investigations were continuing, and asked anyone with any information to get in touch. A source close to employees at the CBI said the crisis of the past few weeks had taken an ""emotional toll"" on staff at the lobbying group. ""At first there was relief that people were talking about it,"" the source said. ""It felt as though taking it public was holding management to account."" ""But now, as darker allegations have come out, this has been hard on the staff."" The source said there had been ""an avalanche"" of members resigning and that staff are concerned about their jobs. ""They're worried about whether the business will still be here tomorrow,"" the source said. The problems at the CBI are becoming more acute by the hour. As new allegations of rape and stalking emerge, some of the UK's biggest companies have started to cut ties with the crisis-hit group. The CBI is trying to move at pace. An investigation by law firm Fox Williams into numerous other alleged offences has been delivered to the group and it will communicate its findings and resulting actions early next week. The return of former CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith from Barclays has been fast-tracked for her to assume the vacated director-general's office within days. But the cracks are already appearing and many member firms have told the BBC it is not a given that they can re-engage with a body with criminal investigations pending that could take many months. Little wonder the atmosphere at the CBI's head office is described as miserable. The Guardian also reported that a woman at the CBI's London office had been stalked by a male colleague in 2018. She complained to the CBI and a finding of harassment was upheld. However, the newspaper reports that the man continued to work at the organisation and eventually left for unrelated reasons. In response, the CBI said: ""We recognise the substance of the harassment report outlined as relating to an allegation made and investigated in January 2018. ""The finding of harassment was upheld and a sanction was imposed."" Dame Carolyn Fairbairn was the director-general of the CBI between 2015 and 2020. The BBC has contacted her for comment. Separately, the CBI fired director-general Tony Danker last week following claims of workplace misconduct against him which were investigated by Fox Williams. Mr Danker took over from Dame Carolyn in late 2020. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, Mr Danker admitted that he had made some staff feel ""very uncomfortable"", adding, ""I apologise for that."" But he said his name had become associated with claims of serious sexual assault that occurred before he joined the CBI. He is now considering legal action against the organisation. Mr McBride said that Mr Danker had been sacked on strong legal grounds. The CBI has appointed Rain Newton-Smith - its former chief economist - as its new director-general. Ms Newton-Smith had been at the CBI for nearly nine years before leaving last month to join Barclays. Mr McBride said: ""We are rightly undertaking an urgent root and branch review of our culture to right the wrongs where we can and to reform our workplace for everyone."" However, some have questioned whether someone who has worked at the CBI is the right person to lead an overhaul of the organisation and its culture. Commenting on Thursday on Ms Newton-Smith's appointment, Ann Francke, the chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute, said: ""I'm not sure there was a huge amount of openness and transparency around the process and obviously you can question whether somebody who was there is the right change agent to change the culture.""

Royal Mail pay offer accepted by Communication Workers Union leaders," Postal workers are being recommended to accept a new pay deal that would end the long-running dispute with the Royal Mail. If members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) accept a 10% pay rise over three years it will signal an end to the row over jobs and conditions which led to a series of walkouts last year. Union members will be balloted on the offer in the coming weeks. Both the Royal Mail and the CWU said it was a ""good"" deal. Royal Mail said the agreement included a 10% salary increase and a one-off lump sum of £500. This includes a previous 2% pay rise from April 2022, a consolidated 6% pay rise from April 2023 and a 2% increase next April. Royal Mail's parent company, International Distributions Services, said if the deal was approved by the CWU membership it would represent a ""good outcome for customers, employees and shareholders"". Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU, said: ''We are completely satisfied that if people look at this agreement in the context of the magnitude of this dispute they will see this as a good agreement that will stand the test of time.'' The agreement also includes a commitment to no compulsory redundancies and covers later start times, changes to sick pay, attendance standards, ill health retirement and revised contracts for new starters. New employees will also be required to regularly work on Sundays. This agreement could bring to an end one of the most bad-tempered of industrial disputes. It was always about so much more than money, which is why it was so difficult to solve. Royal Mail argued that without a dramatic modernisation programme the business would go bust. The postal workers saw that modernisation as a threat to their way of life. Striking workers each lost on average £1,800 over 18 strike days. Someone I spoke to on the picket line said the financial hit was worth it because this was ""their last stand"". It is telling that the head of the CWU, Dave Ward, is sounding so positive about the agreement - it suggests he will really sell it to his members. Around 115,000 CWU members working for Royal Mail have been in dispute over pay since the spring of 2022. The CWU said the offer made last year was not enough, with workers being squeezed by inflation and the cost of living crisis. The union also objected to proposed changes to working conditions. Royal Mail workers staged a series of walkouts last year, including in the lead-up to Christmas. Earlier this month, Royal Mail said a return to industrial action could result in the postal service going into administration. It said the strikes had cost the company £200m in lost business and in covering striking staff. ",464,uk,2023-04-21T13:13:20.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65346232
Rainfall washes out retail sales in March," UK retail sales volumes fell by 0.9% between February and March with shops blaming wet weather for fewer shoppers. Department and clothing stores said they suffered particularly, in the sixth wettest March since 1836. Sales at food shops also fell, down 0.7%, following shortages of some products, official figures showed. Many stores imposed limits on fresh produce such as tomatoes and cucumbers because of poor weather affecting supplies from Spain and North Africa. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said ""26% of adults experienced shortages of essential food items that were needed on a regular basis"" for much of March - an increase of the 18% who reported similar problems in February. The amount of food that people bought last month is 3% below pre-pandemic levels in February 2020, which retailers blamed on the increased cost of living and higher prices. Despite the fall in sales during March, for the first three months of the year sales grew by 0.6% compared with the previous three months, the ONS said, which was the first rise in quarterly sales since August 2021. Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - hit 10.1% in March, mainly due to the increasing cost of food. The rate had been expected to fall below 10%. However, a drop in food production costs - which peaked in October last year according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) - has not yet filtered into supermarkets. The BRC said that it takes between three and nine months for falling prices to reach shops, but it said on Wednesday it expected food prices to start falling ""over the next few months"". The impact of rising food prices can be seen across society. Separate figures from the ONS show that 96% of people it surveyed blamed the price of food shopping for the rising cost of living which they had experienced in the last month. That was greater than the 77% who pointed to gas and electricity bills. As a result, many said they were cutting back on non-essential spending, which could include fashion, while nearly half of those asked said they were shopping around more. Among the respondents, 42% said they were spending less on food shopping and other essentials. Analysts at Capital Economics said the rise in quarterly sales suggested ""the 18-month retail 'recession' may have come to an end. Indeed, the more seasonable weather in April may support a rebound in sales this month"". However, it said sales could still be tempered by a further rise in the interest rate when the Bank of England next meets in May, putting further pressure on consumer spending. The Bank has been raising borrowing costs - which currently stand at 4.25% - to try to calm stubbornly high inflation.

What counts as workplace bullying?," Employers must try to protect staff from bullying in the workplace, but sometimes it is hard to know what to do about the problem. Dominic Raab has resigned as Deputy Prime Minister after a report investigating bullying allegations against him was handed to the prime minister. But how do you know you're being bullied at work, and what can you do about it? The UK government defines it as ""behaviour that makes someone feel intimidated or offended"". Dispute resolution service Acas says that bullying behaviour can be ""malicious or insulting"", or an abuse of power that ""undermines, humiliates, or causes physical or emotional harm to someone"". It can be regular or a one-off, happen in person or online, it can be at work or at a work-related event such as a party, and it may not be obvious. Bullying can range from being very direct, such as verbal or physical abuse, to being subtle, such as excluding people and isolating them. Bullying could include: There is no legal definition of bullying, and human resources professional body the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) says there is no single piece of legislation that covers it. But there are legal protections. Employers have a duty of care to keep you safe at work, and you may be able to claim for breach of employment contract if this doesn't happen. Employment lawyer Jessica Rowson at Oakwood Solicitors, who specialises in stress at work, says courts look at intention and the effect of behaviour on an individual. The lack of a legal definition of bullying can cause confusion for both employees and employers, Ms Rowson adds. While the majority of bullying is abuse of power by bosses, it can also be done by peers or other colleagues. People lower down in the pecking order can bully upwards by showing continued disrespect, refusing to complete tasks, spreading rumours, or doing things to try to make it look as though you are bad at your job. Even business owners can be bullied, although so-called ""upward bullying"" is relatively rare. Bullying can extend to contractors working on site or even job applicants. However, in practice, most bullying disputes involve someone being bullied by their line manager, according to Michelle Last, employment partner at Keystone Law. Unfortunately workplace bullying is fairly common, with more than one in 10 people suffering, according to the CIPD's latest figures. It found that 15% of employees said they were bullied at some point between 2016 and 2019. Women are significantly more likely than men to say they've been bullied. The CIPD says: ""Speak up! It's only by challenging unfair treatment that it can be properly dealt with."" One of the first steps is to discuss the problem with a senior manager or HR. Employment lawyer Anne Pritam at Stephenson Harwood says ""sometimes just getting the issue into the open can make a bully back off"". ""Often people who are perceived as bullies have no idea that they are seen that way, and an informal word from HR or a more senior manager might show an employee that their actions are having unintended consequences,"" she says. It's also a good idea to keep a log of bullying incidents with dates and times, noting how they make you feel, Acas says. If dealing with the problem informally doesn't work, the next step is to raise a grievance, which is a way of making a formal complaint. It's also important to look after your mental health. Jessica Rowson says: ""If your mental health is suffering because of the bullying, do try and recognise that this is an important issue to address, and seek out medical support from your GP, who is there to help."" People may not report bullying because they think it could harm their careers. So organisations must have clear procedures for dealing with bullying, and act fairly and quickly to resolve complaints, the CIPD says. Large employers may have organised systems with employee helplines and teams that handle bullying complaints, says Anne Pritam. For smaller companies, complaints must be taken seriously and investigated, she says. If the complaint turns out to be well-founded, the problem needs to addressed - usually through training, coaching or disciplinary sanctions. Ms Pritam says bullying is ""a high-risk issue"" and can lead employees who have been consistently poorly treated to resign and sue for unfair constructive dismissal or harassment.

Shanghai Auto Show: Mini responds to Chinese ice cream racism uproar," UK-based carmaker Mini has responded to an internet uproar in China accusing it of racism at the Shanghai Auto Show. A video from the event appeared to show Mini staff offering ice cream to foreigners while refusing to give it to Chinese visitors. Mini China, which is owned by Germany's BMW, said the workers were distributing the treats to company employees. However, it also said that it was ""deeply sorry for the negative mood the incident brought on everyone"". In a statement posted on Chinese social media platform Weibo, Mini China said it had given out a total of 600 ice creams during the show on 18 and 19 April. ""In addition to distributing 300 portions of ice cream per day, we also reserved a very small portion for our hardworking colleagues on-site,"" Mini China said. ""The four to five foreigners you see in the video are colleagues who are wearing employee badges,"" it added. The company also said the incident resulted from lapses in management and training, and called for consideration towards staff in the video. In an earlier statement, Mini China said the giveaway was ""intended to give sweetness to friends big and small"". BMW did not immediately respond to a BBC request for further comment on Friday. The topic ""BMW Mini"" quickly became one of the top searches on Weibo, with over 93 million views. The comments were largely negative. ""You should have specified that the initial purpose was to give 'foreign' big and small friends sweetness,"" said a post that drew more than 165,000 likes. ""I feel ashamed as a Mini owner,"" said another user. The incident spurred one vlogger to give out ice cream in front of Mini's auto show booth. ""I was just angry, and I only gave it to Chinese people,"" he told Chinese media outlet Jimu News. However, other social media users called for calm. ""Let's treat this reasonable. No matter what type of explanation [Mini gives], there are always going to be people who disagree,"" said a post that drew several negative reactions. ""We shouldn't excessively magnify a problem to become a question of principle or an ideological issue,"" wrote Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of state-owned newspaper Global Times. ""Let the staff learn their lessons and let their future events return to normal as much as possible. Let's avoid other vendors getting nervous because of this,"" he added. Internet users in China have become increasingly vocal about the depiction of Chinese people amid rising nationalist sentiment online. Last week, French luxury label Dior was also accused of racism on Chinese social media over an advertisement showing an Asian model pulling up the corner of her eye. The picture, promoting Dior's new makeup collection, was swiftly taken down. This was not the first time Dior has been caught up in controversy in China, one of its biggest markets. In 2022, it was accused of ""culturally appropriating"" a Chinese traditional design for one of its skirts. Earlier that year, a Chinese snack brand also drew criticism for using a model with narrow eyes in its advertisements.

Business group CBI reports new 'criminal offence' to police," Business group giant the CBI says it has handed over additional information about what it describes as a serious criminal offence to the police. The City of London police is already investigating claims a woman was raped at a CBI summer party in 2019. The BBC understands that the ""additional information"" relates to a new allegation. The CBI has been engulfed in a crisis over a range of allegations including sexual harassment and misconduct. The organisation is one of the UK's leading business lobby groups and claims to speak for 190,000 companies. In a statement, it said: ""Late yesterday afternoon the CBI was made aware of additional information relating to a report of a serious criminal offence. ""We have passed that information immediately to the police, with whom we are liaising closely and who have asked us not to comment further on potentially criminal matters"". The BBC has contacted the City of London police for comment. The CBI also said it was expecting the results of an investigation into the allegations by the law firm Fox Williams ""imminently"". ""The board will be communicating its response to this and other steps we are taking to bring about the wider change that is needed early next week."" The original allegations emerged after the Guardian reported that more than a dozen woman claimed they had been subject to various forms of sexual misconduct at the CBI. The CBI has since suspended three employees while the investigation took place. Separately, the lobby group fired its director general Tony Danker in April following complaints of workplace misconduct against him. Mr Danker admitted to the BBC that he had made some staff feel ""very uncomfortable"", adding: ""I apologise for that."" However, he said that his ""reputation has been totally destroyed"" because his name had been wrongly associated with separate claims including of serious sexual assault that were made at the CBI before he joined. He said that his dismissal letter had set out four reasons for firing him and added he was considering legal action against the CBI. But Brian McBride, president of the CBI, told the BBC that Mr Danker's description of events was ""selective"" and he was free to seek ""redress"" if he felt unfairly treated. He claimed that Mr Danker had been sacked on strong legal grounds. A former CBI staff member, who was in touch with existing workers at the organisation, said they were ""furious"" and ""upset"" by Mr Danker's interview. ""It's important that we remember who the victims of this situation are: the women who've had negative experiences with men at the CBI,"" she said. ""They have described to me feeling furious, grossed out and upset by Danker's attempts to downplay his role in this situation. As director general, Danker bore responsibility not only for his own actions but for the culture of the organisation under which numerous men acted inappropriately. ""He shouldn't be permitted to sweep that under the carpet."" The CBI said on Thursday: ""Recognising the need for confidentiality, we urge anyone, including the media, who has further information in relation to any alleged offence to also report that to the police."" Rain Newton-Smith, formerly the CBI's chief economist, has been named as the lobby group's new director general. She had left to join Barclays, the banking group. When the CBI announced Ms Newton-Smith's appointment, it also said that it was taking ""a number of steps to bring in new leadership and make immediate changes to the way we operate"". These included appointing Jill Ader, an existing board member of the CBI, to ""oversee a root-and-branch review of our culture, governance and processes"" and lead a new sub-committee with Mr McBride. Commenting on Ms Newton-Smith's appointment, Ann Francke, the chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute, told the BBC: ""I'm not sure there was a huge amount of openness and transparency around the process and obviously you can question whether somebody who was there is the right change agent to change the culture."" She added that organisations typically look for outsiders to come in ""because it is easier to be objective and it is easier to point to the things that need to change"". ""And clearly one of the things that needs to change is a better understanding of and better mechanisms for dealing with sexual harassment and a change in workplace culture that makes people comfortable."" Mr McBride admitted last week that a ""handful"" of small companies had left the CBI since the allegations had emerged. Since then, the British Insurance Brokers' Association has also left, stating: ""We have withdrawn our membership of the CBI in light of recent reports."" The government has also ""paused"" its engagement with the CBI.

Forced adoptions: Welsh government to apologise," The Welsh government is to formally apologise to mothers forced to give away their children. Thousands of unmarried women were subjected to forced adoptions in the 1950s, '60s and '70s. Speaking in the Senedd, Deputy Social Services Minister Julie Morgan will say sorry for the failures in society that led to the practice. The move was welcomed by campaigners who said the UK government should follow suit. One Welsh woman who was forcibly adopted she felt ""robbed"" of her culture after she was taken from a Welsh-speaking mother. It is likely that thousands of children in Wales were forcibly adopted - a UK Parliament inquiry estimated that 185,000 babies were affected across England and Wales. The joint committee on human rights of MPs and peers found many women were shamed and coerced into giving up their children. The Welsh government's decision comes a month after Scotland's former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's apology on the same issue, and ten years after Australia said sorry for the practice. Anne Jones, from Glan Conwy, was adopted as a baby by a family in Llandudno in the 1950s. Her birth mother, Katie Green, from Caernarfon, had her outside of marriage at the age of 36. She told BBC Wales last year that her mother had ""no choice"" but to give her up due to ""shame"" and no financial support. She said her adoptive family made her feel that she ""was illegitimate and therefore wasn't good enough"". Although she located her brother, who had stayed with his mother, she was only able to find out who her mother was years after she died. Ms Jones, 71, has been among those campaigning for a formal UK government apology. She welcomed the Welsh government's decision but was disappointed that it was not happening at the UK level. ""One of the things that every adopted person will tell you is: you feel you don't know who you are. ""You don't know whether there's anybody else in the world who looks like you."" Ms Jones, who grew up in Llandudno, said she had been ""robbed"" of her culture. ""My mother was Welsh, and because she lived and was born and brought up in Caernarfon, she was Welsh speaking. That's something I missed out on."" She added: ""I feel sorry for the people in England who have not had their apology yet, because I feel they are being discriminated against. ""It's a stigma that is put on people. It shouldn't have happened and they should be receiving an apology."" Mothers told the joint committee inquiry they felt their treatment during and after giving birth was deliberate punishment for their pregnancy while unmarried. Young women were sent away from home to conceal their pregnancies and spent weeks in mother and baby homes. Many women said they were abused by social workers, nurses and other staff, and denied pain relief. The Welsh government and the Senedd did not exist at the time forced adoptions were taking place. The UK government, which fully governed Wales until 1999, rejected the committee's calls for a formal apology in its response to its findings. While it said the treatment of women and children was wrong and should not have happened, ministers said an apology would not be appropriate ""since the state did not actively support these practices"". However it said it was ""sorry on behalf of society to all those affected"". Veronica Smith, the founder of the Movement for an Adoption Apology, welcomed the announcement. She said the UK government ""should now follow the example of Welsh and Scottish governments"". ""They claim that the state weren't involved but we have lots of academic research that the state was,"" she said. Family acceptance remains an issue, she said. ""Few people in Wales have come forward but we expect many more to be out there. It's still a very painful thing and shame is involved"".""It will be a great relief to those affected that it's being talked about publicly at last,"" she added. Julie Morgan gave an apology in a personal capacity in January. The deputy minister said that while forced adoption practices predated devolution in Wales, ""they have a lasting legacy on all those who experienced them - for both the parents and the children"". ""We cannot change what has happened, but I can provide assurances that adoption legislation and practices have been significantly strengthened since and we will strive to provide as much support as we can."" Ms Morgan will deliver her statement in the Welsh Parliament late afternoon on Tuesday. The UK government has been approached for comment.

Welsh teen forced to take virginity test before marriage," It wasn't just being forced to marry that Farah was against, she also didn't want the test to show she was a virgin. She was forced to undergo a ""degrading"" virginity test before she was coerced into a marriage at the age of 18. ""I didn't know it was a form of abuse"" said Farah. ""I felt ashamed of what they made me go through and I carry this with me now."" Virginity testing is illegal in the UK yet charities helping women affected by honour-based abuse still see cases. Farah - which is not her real name - said her mum took her to a ""doctor in the community to see if I was clean"". ""I was coerced into a marriage when I was 18, with the expectation of living with my husband's family,"" she recalled. ""This is not what I wanted and they knew that. I resisted this until the last minute but it made no difference. ""If I had known there was help maybe I would have spoken to someone who understood."" Farah said she was also ""humiliated"" on her wedding night when her bloody sheets were shown to her mother-in-law ""to prove I was a virgin"". A virginity test is an illegal procedure which involves the inspection of the hymen in the vagina, intended to determine whether a woman or girl is a virgin. But the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have said virginity tests have no scientific merit or clinical indication. They say there is no known examination that can prove whether a woman has had vaginal intercourse because the hymen can tear for reasons like tampon use and exercise. A BBC investigation in 2020 found women were being offered controversial ""virginity tests"" at British medical clinics, with some advertising so-called ""virginity repair"" - a procedure called hymenoplasty. It has been illegal to carry out, offer or aid and abet virginity testing in the UK since 2022 and anyone convicted faces a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and the possibility of an unlimited fine. The Health and Care Act 2022 also made it illegal for UK nationals and residents to help with virginity testing outside the UK. The WHO has said virginity testing was known to be practised in at least 20 countries. The intrusive tests are considered a violation of human rights by the WHO and the United Nations - and both organisations want to see them banned worldwide. Farah is now safe having escaped her abusive environment and has moved away from Wales. But her experiences have had a lasting impact, and she wanted to share her story to raise awareness and help other young women who may be facing the same abuse. ""Not many communities will speak out about this but I know a few girls have gone through this but don't know where to go for help,"" she said. The number of women affected by virginity testing in the UK is not widely known, as issues related to sex can be taboo in these communities. Some people also do not recognise it as abuse or realise it is illegal - and therefore many do not come forward to report it. One organisation that supports women from black and ethnic backgrounds has helped seven women who have experienced virginity testing between April and December 2022 and another three who had hymenoplasty. Bawso said their cases included people from Egyptian, South African, Pakistan, Indian and Saudi Arabian backgrounds. ""It is a prevalent issue as Wales has a lot of people who have migrated from those countries that practice virginity testing,"" said its interim chief executive Wanjiku Ngotho-Mbugua. ""We know that people carry their culture with them and culture is so hard to get rid of. The girls who have gone through it are so embarrassed themselves. ""It has not just psychological effects, but a physical effect on these girls because it's an attack on their dignity. And checking the hymen - that's a sexual assault. ""These traditions are backwards and we need to get rid of them. We need to challenge culture when it's painful."" Karma Nirvana, a charity that helps survivors of honour-based abuse, has also supported 19 women affected by virginity testing since 2021 and want to raise awareness that the procedure is illegal. Director Natasha Ratu said she understood the procedure could cause ""psychological pain and trauma"" and women should know virginity tests are not ""evidence-based"". She said society should ""dismantle the idea of virginity and not define women by their sexual status"". Information and guidance for medical professions has been created by the Welsh government to help them recognise the signs of this form of abuse. ""I think this is something that is quite possibly not talked about enough,"" said Wales' Chief Nursing Officer Sue Tranka. ""This isn't an easy conversation to have, it's quite sensitive and you want to ensure that you help women and girls to speak up on this topic. ""We need to call it out. We need to do so in the safest possible way, and we need to look after our survivors."" If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has links to organisations which can offer support and advice ",884,uk,2023-04-24T21:56:50.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65055005
SNP working towards deadline to file accounts - Yousaf," Scotland's first minister has told the BBC he is ""going to work towards meeting the deadline"" to arrange an auditor to process the SNP's accounts. Humza Yousaf's remarks came after the party's Westminster leader acknowledged it could miss out on £1.2m in public funds if the 31 May deadline is missed. Mr Yousaf was speaking after his first in-person meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak since taking the role. They discussed issues including the cost of living crisis and devolution. Speaking to the BBC about finding a new auditor for the party, Mr Yousaf said: ""It'll be challenging. I won't pretend otherwise. ""There is the ability to ask for an extension if required. We're not in that space yet."" Mr Yousaf and Mr Sunak met in the House of Commons earlier on Monday evening. The Scottish government said Mr Yousaf raised concerns around ""UK government attacks on devolution"". It also said Mr Yousaf made clear that he expects Mr Sunak to ""respect the democratic wishes of Scotland's Parliament"" by granting a Section 30 order, which would grant the power to hold a second independence referendum. The first minister told the BBC they ""got along fine"" during the meeting in London. He said: ""Very helpfully, at the start of the meeting, he gave me a briefing on the situation in Sudan. ""I said any briefing we can get will be very helpful, given that there will be a number of Scots with family out there who will be deeply affected. ""On a personal level, he seemed perfectly affable enough."" The meeting took place amid a looming court battle. The Scottish government has announced plans to launch a legal challenge to Westminster's block on its controversial gender reforms. The proposals, which would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex, were passed by the Scottish Parliament in December last year. But they were blocked by the UK government over their potential impact on UK-wide equality laws. The first minister has previously said challenging the UK government's block on the gender Bill was ""our only means of defending our parliament's democracy from the Westminster veto"" but Mr Sunak said Westminster had taken ""very careful and considered advice"" on the issue before acting. The meeting also came after the Scottish government delayed the introduction of its deposit return scheme from August to March next year, in a move that circular economy minister Lorna Slater blamed on Westminster. She said the delay was primarily due to the UK government not providing an exemption to the Internal Market Act, which was implemented after Britain left the European Union to regulate trade within the country. Mr Yousaf added: ""I did mention to the Prime Minister that where can work together collaboratively of course I would be keen to do that. ""And one way we could do that for example is in relation to the UK government granting an exemption to the internal market act for the deposit return scheme."" They also discussed the cost-of-living crisis and rising energy bills as well as the Scotch whisky industry. While the talks were their first in person since the SNP leader became Scotland's first minister last month, it will not be their first conversation. The pair spoke via telephone after Mr Yousaf was chosen by MSPs to be first minister on 28 March. ",553,uk,2023-04-24T21:47:42.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-65371628
"Illegal Migration Bill risks breaching human rights obligations, watchdog warns"," Plans aimed at stopping people crossing the Channel in small boats risk breaching the UK's human rights obligations, a watchdog has warned. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said the government's Illegal Migration Bill also risked exposing people to serious harm. It said it was particularly worried about the possibility of children and pregnant women being detained. The government said the bill was ""within our international obligations"". The legislation, which will see its remaining stages debated in the Commons on Wednesday, would prevent anyone arriving in the UK illegally from claiming asylum. Instead they would be detained and removed, either to Rwanda or another ""safe country"". The power to detain and remove individuals also covers children and pregnant women, although the home secretary has said unaccompanied children would only be removed before they reach 18 under limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of family reunion. The government says the plans are central to achieving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop small boat crossings - one of his five key priorities. However, they have faced criticism from opposition parties and charities, who have argued the bill is unworkable and could breach international law. The EHRC said it was ""seriously concerned"" the legislation risked ""placing the UK in breach of its international legal obligations to protect human rights"". It said the bill ""undermines the core principle of the universality of human rights"" and risked breaching the international Refugee Convention, which the UK is signed up to, by restricting the right to asylum and penalising refugees. The commission also highlighted provisions removing protections for victims of trafficking and modern slavery as ""particularly worrying"". However, it welcomed the government's commitment to increase safe routes for those seeking asylum to come to the UK and recommended these were brought forward alongside the bill. The government promised to set out details of safe and legal routes and any proposals for new routes in an amendment to the bill, following calls from some Conservative MPs including Tim Loughton. Senior Tories including former Prime Minister Theresa May have raised concerns victims of modern slavery would be denied help under the bill, while others are worried about provisions allowing children to be detained. But the government has also been under pressure from Tory MPs on the right of the party to toughen up the bill and make it easier for the home secretary to ignore attempts by European judges to halt deportations of migrants from the UK. A government amendment to the bill published on Monday states that interim injunctions by the European Court of Human Rights do not affect the duty to remove individuals who arrive in the UK illegally. However, any amendments have to be approved by MPs and peers, some of whom have already raised concerns the proposal could breach international law. The bill is expected to face significant opposition in the House of Lords and legal challenge if it becomes law. Asked about criticism of the bill, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We cannot allow a system to continue which incentivises people to risk their lives and pay people smugglers to come here illegally.""

Sudan violence: UK insists contact continues with trapped Britons," The government insists it is in touch with Britons still stuck in Sudan after an evacuation operation only rescued UK diplomats and their families. Minister Andrew Mitchell said 2,000 UK nationals had registered for help, but there could be up to 4,000 in Sudan. The diplomats, who were flown out on Sunday, had been in a terrible position surrounded by fighting, he added. Violence in Sudan between two opposing forces has seen deadly shooting and shelling in the capital, Khartoum. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has warned help for UK nationals remains ""limited"" until a ceasefire is reached - as some said they felt abandoned by the UK government. Alicia Kearns, Conservative MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said Britons stuck in Sudan were living in ""abject fear"" and the lack of contact with them suggested ""no lessons have been learnt since Afghanistan"". The power struggle that erupted last week between Sudan's regular army and a paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has also affected other parts of the country, leading to a growing humanitarian crisis. Electricity is scarce and food and water supplies are running out for many. Sam, a British businessman living in Sudan, told the BBC on Sunday that news of the UK evacuation at the weekend ""gave us hope, but in the absence of any information from the government this was clearly a solution for diplomats only"". He described the situation as a ""nightmare for those of us left behind"", and said he knew of many people from other countries such as Hungary and South Africa whose embassies were making plans to evacuate nationals. Another UK citizen in Sudan, William, opted to leave Khartoum on a bus organised by his Sudanese employer, taking him and other British nationals to neighbouring Egypt. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme on Sunday evening, he said the UK government had given him no support, adding: ""We had to basically go private, we've had absolutely nothing but nonsense from the government, and not even nonsense. We've had nothing."" William described waiting to be collected by the bus as a ""dicey situation"" with ""gunfire going off all the time"". Amar, who lives in Edinburgh, has been visiting family in Omdurman which is about 15 miles north of Sudan's capital. Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, he said he did what the Foreign Office recommended but has not heard back. ""It's getting worse by the minute"", he said, explaining that he is considering whether to evacuate by road to Egypt. Describing the situation as traumatising, Amar's wife Fatima added: ""It's getting worse - the clashes, the fighting, and there are dead bodies everywhere."" ""Everyone is trying to escape and flee the country and you can see the country is really getting into a civil war and in the middle of all this you don't get any kind of support."" Over the weekend, the prime minister confirmed that diplomats and their families had been evacuated in a ""complex and rapid"" operation. It is understood UK special forces troops landed in Khartoum with a US evacuation team on Saturday. Military vehicles were then used to collect UK embassy staff and their families, before they were airlifted to Cyprus on Sunday morning. The British army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force were involved in the rescue, with C-130 Hercules and Airbus A400M transport aircraft used, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told BBC News. Defence minister James Heappey said the embassy rescue mission ""went without a hitch"" despite its complexity - but that the ""job isn't done"". The Ministry of Defence is working on options to support British nationals in Sudan which will be presented to the prime minister, he said. The situation on the ground is at times ""extremely dangerous"" and the ""window in which the environment is permissive is rarely long enough in which to do the military options,"" he said. Briefing defence journalists, Mr Heappey admitted the UK had been caught out by the rapid deterioration in Sudan, adding: ""It is fair to say that nobody in the UK government nor really in the wider international community saw fighting of this ferocity breaking out in the way that it did"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Mitchell said British Embassy staff had been between the lines of fighting and in ""very great danger"" - with one official held at gun point. The government had a ""specific duty of care"" to diplomats evacuated from Sudan, he added. Mr Mitchell said a civilian evacuation had not been feasible on the weekend, but insisted ""we are exploring every possible opportunity to get our citizens out"". He called for a ceasefire in Sudan, and urged Britons to follow government advice to ""stay indoors"". UK citizens in Sudan are also being asked to tell the Foreign Office where they are in case more help becomes available, with a hotline in place for those who need urgent help. Mr Mitchell said about 2,000 people had registered for assistance, with that figure rising over the last two days. He insisted electronic messages from the UK emergency team were being sent every day, but explained they might not always arrive. Meanwhile, Ms Kearns said evacuations were proving enormously difficult ""but we have to get our people out"". Asked on the Today programme about a person who claimed they had only received two text messages from the government, Ms Kearns said: ""So that would suggest that no lessons have been learned since Afghanistan, and I have urged the government to make sure they are communicating regularly with British nationals."" However, Downing Street said ""significant lessons"" had been learned from the evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021 - which at the time was criticised as chaotic. The prime minister's spokesperson also said the government would ""pull every leaver possible"" to help Britons in Sudan and to bring about a ceasefire. Mr Sunak and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi agreed on Sunday that the UK and Egypt would work with international partners on diplomatic efforts to secure one. A further Cobra meeting - an emergency response committee made up of ministers, civil servants and others - is expected later to discuss Sudan's ""escalation"" of violence. Several other countries including the US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain have been evacuating their diplomats and citizens. How have you been affected by what's happening in Sudan?

What is House of Commons Short Money?," The SNP currently has no auditors and could lose out on £1.2m in ""Short Money"" if it fails to submit its accounts by 31 May. While UK political parties rely on donations to fund their campaigning activities, Short Money is public funding that allows opposition parties to carry out their parliamentary work. The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn confirmed that his party group could miss out on this cash if it misses the accounts deadline. To qualify for Short Money a party must have at least two MPs, or one MP and more than 150,000 votes. As of April 2022, the amount payable to qualifying parties is £19,401 for every seat won by a party at the last general election plus £38.75 for every 200 votes gained by the party. There is also a travel fund of £213,132 which is shared between the parties in line with the same formula. The leader of the opposition is also given £903,907 to run their office. Labour will this year receive £7m which includes a payment of almost £904,000 to run the leader of the opposition's office. The SNP is in line to receive £1.2m, the Lib Dems £953,000, the DUP £208,000, the Green Party £192,000, the SDLP £114,000 and Plaid Cymru £114,000. Short Money takes its name from former Labour MP Edward Short who was instrumental in its introduction as leader of the House of Commons in 1974 and 1975. The original idea was to create more of a level-playing field for opposition parties. The governing party has access to the full might of the civil service machine to formulate its policies. To hold ministers properly to account, opposition party MPs should be able to employ researchers and carry out detailed policy work. It is meant to be used on policy research for frontbench spokesmen and to pay staff salaries in the Whips and leader of the opposition's offices. It is not meant to be used for political campaigning or paying staff salaries at party HQ. Parties claiming Short Money must provide the accounting officer of the House of Commons (the clerk of the house) with an auditor's certificate confirming that all expenses claimed were incurred exclusively in relation to the party's parliamentary business. They also have to provide information on staff employed and other costs funded through Short Money. A similar scheme, Cranborne Money, after the then Leader of the House of Lords, was agreed on 27 November 1996, to provide financial assistance for opposition parties, in the House of Lords.

"Diane Abbott's comments were antisemitic, Labour leader says"," Comments made by former shadow minister Diane Abbott in a letter were antisemitic, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Ms Abbott was suspended as a Labour MP after suggesting Jewish, Irish and Traveller people were not subject to racism ""all their lives"". She later apologised and withdrew the remarks, written in a letter to the Observer newspaper. Sir Keir condemned the letter and said he acted swiftly to suspend Ms Abbott. Sir Keir said that the swiftness with which the MP had had the whip removed demonstrated ""how far the Labour party has changed"" and that Labour has ""zero tolerance"" of antisemitism. When pressed repeatedly on whether Ms Abbott's comments showed prejudice towards Jewish people, Sir Keir said: ""In my view, what she said was to be condemned, it was antisemitic."" But Sir Keir would not be drawn on whether Ms Abbott should be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate in the next election, saying ""there's an investigation going on"". On Sunday, Labour said the chief whip - who is responsible for party management of MPs - had suspended Ms Abbott pending an investigation. Suspending the whip means Ms Abbott will not be allowed to represent Labour in the House of Commons, where she will now sit as an independent MP. Earlier Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said ""it will be for the chief whip and the leader to decide what happens next"". Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire told the BBC's Politics Live programme she found it ""hard to see"" Ms Abbott returning as a Labour MP. Sir Keir vowed to ""root out"" antisemitism within Labour after complaints of Jewish prejudice dogged the party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Under Mr Corbyn's leadership, concerns that antisemitism was on the rise culminated in the party being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and being found to have acted unlawfully. Mr Corbyn is still suspended from the parliamentary party after comments he made that suggested the scale of the problem had been overstated. The EHRC said in February that it was now satisfied with Labour's action on the issue. Ms Abbott has been an MP since 1987, was the first black woman elected to Parliament and served as Mr Corbyn's shadow home secretary. In her letter to the Observer, she wrote that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people ""undoubtedly experience prejudice"", which she said is ""similar to racism"". She continued: ""It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. ""But they are not all their lives subject to racism. ""In pre-civil rights America, Irish people, Jewish people and Travellers were not required to sit at the back of the bus. ""In apartheid South Africa, these groups were allowed to vote. ""And at the height of slavery, there were no white-seeming people manacled on the slave ships."" She had been responding to a comment piece in the Guardian questioning the view that racism ""only affects people of colour"". Ms Abbott's letter prompted a backlash, including from the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which described it as ""disgraceful"" and her apology ""entirely unconvincing"". In her apology, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington said ""errors"" arose in an initial draft that was sent. She added: ""But there is no excuse, and I wish to apologise for any anguish caused. ""Racism takes many forms, and it is completely undeniable that Jewish people have suffered its monstrous effects, as have Irish people, Travellers and many others.""

SNP could miss out on £1.2m if accounts not filed on time," The SNP's Westminster group could miss out on £1.2m in public funds if it fails to file its accounts by the 31 May deadline, its leader has confirmed. Stephen Flynn told the BBC he could not give any commitment as to whether the deadline would be met. However, the MP said ""everything possible"" was being done to ensure this was the case. Mr Flynn said the party was having problems finding new auditors after the previous company resigned in September. Accountancy firm Johnston Carmichael, which had worked with the party for more than a decade, said the decision was taken after a review of its clients. However, First Minister Humza Yousaf confirmed he only found out about it when he took on his new role at the end of March. And Mr Flynn has told BBC Scotland he only learned of the situation in February. It comes amid the ongoing police investigation into the SNP's finances, which saw its former chief executive Peter Murrell and treasurer Colin Beattie arrested earlier this month. Both men were released without charge pending further inquiry. Separate accounts need to be submitted for the Westminster group by 31 May in order to receive ""Short Money"" - public funding for opposition parties to carry out their parliamentary work. The SNP is in line for about £1.2m. Mr Flynn told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I thought it would be a relatively straight forward process to secure new auditors but that's proven not to be the case."" He said this was partly due to the fact that the financial year was nearing its end as well as the overall challenges in the party's finances. When asked if the party would lose its Short Money if the deadline was not met, Mr Flynn said: ""As I understand it, that would be the case, yes."" He described it as a ""situation which is in a state of flux"" and added: ""I wouldn't want to incur any concern amongst staff that we aren't going to be able to meet our deadlines."" Mr Flynn said he only found out by email on 10 February that the party's auditors had resigned in September. This was despite the SNP's former Westminster leader Ian Blackford last week saying that all relevant information was handed over to Mr Flynn during the changeover in December. Mr Flynn said ""there may well have been discussions between other people"" but reiterated that he was only fully informed of the situation on 10 February. ""I became fully aware of the situation in February,"" he said. ""I received an email from a finance officer who advised me that back in September the party's auditors had opted not to continue and we needed to find our own. ""So since then we've been in the process of trying to find our own because it's important that we are able to undertake our commitments in that regard."" First Minister Humza Yousaf has said that appointing new auditors was one of his ""major priorities"" and has ordered a governance and transparency review. Police Scotland launched its Operation Branchform investigation in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how more than £600,000 of donations earmarked for independence campaigning were spent. Questions were raised after accounts showed the SNP had just under £97,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about £272,000. Last year it emerged that former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, who is married to former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, gave a loan of more than £100,000 to the SNP to help it out with a ""cash flow"" issue after the last election. He was arrested two weeks ago at the couple's home in Glasgow before also being released without charge pending further inquiries. He had resigned as SNP chief executive last month after taking responsibility for misleading statements about a fall in party membership. Treasurer Colin Beattie has now also stepped down. He was also arrested and released without charge as part of the police investigation. ",669,uk,2023-04-24T11:16:21.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-65373659
Sudan fighting: Diplomats and foreign nationals evacuated," A growing list of countries have evacuated diplomats and citizens from Sudan's capital as fierce fighting continues to rage in Khartoum. The US and UK announced on Sunday they had flown diplomats out of the country. France, Germany, Italy and Spain have also been evacuating diplomats and other nationals. A vicious power struggle between the regular army and a powerful paramilitary force has led to violence across Sudan for more than a week. US authorities said they had airlifted fewer than 100 people with three Chinook helicopters on Sunday morning in a ""fast and clean"" operation. The US embassy in Khartoum is now closed, and a tweet on its official feed says it is not safe enough for the government to evacuate private US citizens. The UK government managed to airlift British diplomats and their families out of the country in what was described as a ""complex and rapid"" operation. Foreign Minister James Cleverly said options to evacuate the remaining British nationals in Sudan were ""severely limited"". More than 1,000 European Union citizens had been taken out of Sudan, according to an update from the EU's foreign policy chief on Monday morning. Individual countries have given updates on their evacuation operations: Earlier, more than 150 people - mostly citizens of Gulf countries, as well as Egypt, Pakistan and Canada - were evacuated by sea to the Saudi Arabian port of Jeddah. Long lines of United Nations vehicles and buses were seen leaving Khartoum on Sunday, heading east towards Port Sudan on the Red Sea and carrying ""citizens from all over the world"", a Sierra Leonean evacuee told AFP news agency. South African diplomat Clayson Monyela said ongoing fighting meant that all routes out of Khartoum were ""risky and dangerous"". ""The airport remains closed, the fighting continues,"" he told the BBC. ""This is why we continue to call for a ceasefire to allow for a safe passage for those who want to get out and to allow for humanitarian aid."" There have been desperate calls for help from many foreign students - from Africa, Asia and the Middle East - who are also stuck in Khartoum, a city of some six million people. A Nigerian student association in Sudan called on its government to conduct an ""immediate rescue mission"", saying many students had chosen to flee. Meanwhile, internet monitoring group NetBlocks said Sudan was in the midst of an ""internet blackout"", with connectivity at 2% of ordinary levels, which could seriously hinder the coordination of help for those trapped in Khartoum and other cities. The power struggle has seen heavy bombardment in the capital city, with hundreds killed and thousands more injured. The near-constant shooting and bombing in Khartoum and elsewhere has cut electricity and safe access to food and water for much of the population. Several ceasefires that had seemingly been agreed by both sides were ignored, including a three-day pause to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which started on Friday. On Sunday, the US announced a disaster response team would be sent to the area to ""coordinate the humanitarian response for those in need both within and outside of Sudan."" Samantha Power from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) said the team would work out of Kenya at first, and prioritise getting ""life-saving humanitarian assistance to those who need it most."" The World Health Organization says the fighting has killed more than 400 people and injured thousands. But the death toll is believed to be much higher as people are struggling to get healthcare, as most of the city's hospitals have been forced to close by the fighting. Along with Khartoum, the western region of Darfur - where the RSF first emerged - has also been badly affected by the fighting. The UN has warned that up to 20,000 people - mostly women and children - have fled Sudan to seek safety in Chad, across the border from Darfur. Are you are foreign citizen in Sudan?

Local elections 2023: How sewage topped the political agenda," ""It's like swimming in an open sewer. Wet wipes, tampons, other detritus, it's disgusting. It smells like a filthy toilet."" That is the experience of Scarborough surfer Steve Crawford, of Surfers Against Sewage. Every time there's a bit of rain, not a severe storm, he says, the town's North Bay receives an overflow of sewage - sometimes for several hours at a time. According to the Environment Agency (EA), the quality of the bathing water there is excellent. Yorkshire Water said it spent £110m on improving water quality on beaches along a 50-mile stretch of North Sea coastline between 2010 and 2014, installing hi-tech waste water equipment at sites in Scarborough, Bridlington, Flamborough, Filey and Skipsea to make beaches ""cleaner than ever"". It says sewage discharges on its coastline were down by nearly half in the 2022 bathing season - and a further £180m is being spent on a ""storm overflow improvement plan"". But, according to Mr Crawford, the measures have not worked. He questions how well the new storage tanks and pumps are operating because he says their capacity appears to be breached so often, with waste consistently backed up. Ana Cowie, a marine pollution officer at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, says North and East Yorkshire's rivers and coasts are under huge stress from a range of factors including sewage overflows, and identifies wet wipes being flushed down toilets as a big issue. The government has recently proposed a ban on wet wipes containing plastic in England but Ms Cowie warns there are no simple fixes. As well as infrastructure changes, the environment needs to be held in much higher regard for bad habits to change, she says. Two weeks before voters in parts of England and in Northern Ireland go to the polls to choose new councillors, those in office are swimming against a tide of public anger at water companies dumping untreated, raw sewage. Most waste water travels to sewage works to be treated but under ""exceptional circumstances"", companies are allowed to pump the excess into the sea and rivers to prevent homes and roads being flooded with it. However, EA figures show this is not occasional. Last year, sewage was pumped into England's waterways for a total of 1.75 million hours - 825 times a day on average. This was 19% down on 2021, because of drier weather rather than water firms' actions, according to the agency. In recent years, Conservative MPs and Tory-run councils in rural and coastal communities have felt the ire of people who have encountered evidence of sewage while out with their children, walking their dogs, or swimming. Beaches by holiday resorts have repeatedly been contaminated and last September, people were advised not to swim at six beaches in Sussex when sewage was released into the sea. Anger has also been stoked on social media since left-wing site EvolvePolitics listed 265 Conservative MPs who voted ""to allow"" water companies to carry on dumping sewage -  blocking a Labour amendment to the Environment Bill which would have placed a legal duty on firms to phase out the practice. The Tories argued the move was unworkable and would result in raw sewage entering people's homes as well as higher household charges. But plans to fine water companies for dumping sewage were recently announced by Environment Secretary Therese Coffey as part of a raft of measures to ""make polluters pay"". The Green Party, which wants to see the water industry renationalised, said firms could not go on being ""rewarded for failure"" and its co-leader Adrian Ramsay has called for a halt to dividend payouts to shareholders. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who described the sewage issue as a ""national scandal"", has called for a ban on dumping on blue flag beaches and the party believes its message is particularly hitting home with the ""dog walker demographic"" and younger people. Water firms in England and Wales have been private, regional monopolies since 1989, accused by some of putting profits and executive bonuses before promised investment. They remain the only countries in the world to have a fully privatised water and sewage disposal system, though there is little evidence publicly-owned services in Scotland and Northern Ireland cope any better with sewage. Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon has accused the Conservatives of allowing England's communities to be treated as ""open sewers"" and has called for automatic fines and a target to end 90% of sewage discharges by 2030. The Conservatives say sewage is dumped more frequently in Wales where Labour is in power, while the UK government has introduced widespread monitoring and tougher regulations. Meanwhile the proportion of bathing waters assessed as excellent has risen from 51% in 2010 to 72%, ministers add. The Conservative Environment Network (CEN) argues the government is partly the victim of its own success in increasing monitoring of overflows and providing more information. These days, storm overflow and sewage figures are perhaps as closely watched as GDP and NHS waiting lists at the headquarters of the UK's political parties - and the issue looks set to roll on into the next general election campaign.

Emergency alert test fails to sound on some phones," Smartphones which did not receive a nationwide emergency alert test will be part of a review into the trial of the alarm. While millions of people across the UK heard an alarm on their phones at 15:00 BST on Sunday, many others did not. The government was testing an alert that could be used to warn about dangerous situations including fires, flooding or terror attacks. The alarm lasted for around 10 seconds on 4G and 5G devices. Many people on social media reported the alert went off one minute earlier or later than planned, when a loud, buzzing alarm rang out and the words ""severe alert"" flashed up on their phones' screens. And some said they did not receive the alert at all. Twitter user Lucy wrote: ""Kind of disappointed to not get one."" Another tweeted: ""15:30 and still waiting for my national alert to warn me of impending doom."" While a third said: ""I did not turn off alerts but I never got the text or the noise alert!"" A Cabinet Office spokesperson acknowledged that the alert did not reach some mobile phones, adding it ""will be looking at this as part of our review of the test"". The department also said engineers had spotted a trend of phone functions failing to work afterwards, adding that officials were in the early stages of analysing the results of the trial run. Many users of the Three mobile network said they did not receive the alert. A spokesperson for the company later said it was""aware that a number of customers have not received the test alert. We're working closely with the government to understand why and ensure it doesn't happen when the system is in use"". Andrew Hamilton, a member of the UK Youth Parliament for North Down, who is also blind, called the alert ""inaccessible"". He told BBC News: ""I use a screen reader but because of the alert sound, the screen reader couldn't tell me what the alert was about."" The government had previously advised that those with 2G or 3G devices would not get the alert, along with phones that were off or in aeroplane mode. People were further advised to ensure their phones had all the latest software updates, including iPhones running iOS 14.5 or later and Android phones and tablets running Android 11 or later. In Wales, the alert included a translation error as the words ""others safe"" appeared in the message as ""eraill yn Vogel"" rather than ""eraill yn ddiogel"" in Welsh. ""Vogel"" does not mean anything in Welsh, as there is no letter V in its alphabet - although Vogel is a ski resort in Slovenia. People who do not wish to receive future alerts can opt out using their device settings. Deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden warned beforehand that the alarm would be ""a bit inconvenient and annoying"", as well as ""irritating"". However, he added it ""could be the sound that saves your life"" in the future. Mr Dowden also denied criticism the alert was an example of nanny statism as he appeared on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. He said: ""If you look at countries around the world, whether it is the United States, Canada, Japan and elsewhere, they have emergency alerts on phones as another tool in the toolkit of keeping people alerted during an emergency."" Drivers were warned not to pick up their mobile phones during the test as it would still be illegal. Drivers caught holding a phone behind the wheel face six penalty points and a £200 fine. Meanwhile, the National Centre for Domestic Violence warned people with hidden mobile phones to turn off the alerts to avoid revealing the location of any secret devices. While the alert is intended to be used in emergencies in the future, some took to social media to poke fun at people who were surprised to see the alert flash up and hear the siren sounding on their phone. Love Island star Jessie Wynter posted a video on TikTok of fellow contestant Will Young appearing perplexed and asking friends, ""what does that mean?""

Diane Abbott suspended as Labour MP after racism letter," Diane Abbott has been suspended as a Labour MP pending an investigation into a letter she wrote about racism to the Observer, the party has said. The politician said ""many types of white people with points of difference"" can experience prejudice, in a letter published on Sunday. But they are not subject to racism ""all their lives"", she said. She later tweeted to say she was withdrawing her remarks and apologised ""for any anguish caused"". Labour said the comments were ""deeply offensive and wrong"". Suspending the whip means Ms Abbott will not be allowed to represent Labour in the House of Commons, where she will now sit as an independent MP. The BBC has approached Ms Abbott for comment. In the letter, she wrote that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people ""undoubtedly experience prejudice"", which she said is ""similar to racism"". She continued: ""It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. ""But they are not all their lives subject to racism. ""In pre-civil rights America, Irish people, Jewish people and Travellers were not required to sit at the back of the bus. ""In apartheid South Africa, these groups were allowed to vote. ""And at the height of slavery, there were no white-seeming people manacled on the slave ships."" She had been responding to a comment piece in the Guardian questioning the view that racism ""only affects people of colour"". Ms Abbott's letter prompted a backlash, including from the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which described it as ""disgraceful"" and her apology ""entirely unconvincing"". The group had urged Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to remove the whip. In her apology, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington said ""errors"" arose in an initial draft that was sent. She continued: ""But there is no excuse, and I wish to apologise for any anguish caused. ""Racism takes many forms, and it is completely undeniable that Jewish people have suffered its monstrous effects, as have Irish people, Travellers and many others."" Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who is Jewish, called the letter ""deeply offensive and deeply distressing"". She backed the suspension of the whip, tweeting: ""No excuses. No delays. ""The comments will be investigated and she has been immediately suspended."" The Jewish Labour Movement - an organisation of Labour-supporting Jewish members - said it ""regretfully"" supported the party's decision. It tweeted: ""Diane Abbott is one of the most respected people in the Labour Party as an activist who overcame racism and prejudice to become Britain's first black woman MP. ""We should be unified in our struggle against racism, not divided against one another. ""A hierarchy of racism only divides communities and assists the racists."" The recent history of the Labour Party means that any comment which seems to downplay the experiences of Jewish people is toxic, especially when it comes from a prominent figure associated with the Jeremy Corbyn era. Under his leadership, concerns that antisemitism was on the rise culminated in the party being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and being found to have acted unlawfully. Mr Corbyn is still suspended from the parliamentary party after comments he made that suggested the scale of the problem had been overstated. Ms Abbott served as shadow home secretary in Mr Corbyn's cabinet between 2016 to 2020. The Jewish Voice for Labour group, which has consistently supported Mr Corbyn, said Ms Abbott's letter should have been ""drafted with more care"", but added it was ""no ground for suspension from the Labour Party"". It added that Ms Abbott's suspension ""is yet a further attack on our freedom to debate very important issues in the Labour party. Her original letter was not antisemitic and the way some critics have rounded on her as if it were is cynical and unhelpful"". A spokesperson for Friends, Families and Travellers said: ""Diane Abbott's letter accurately demonstrates the constant erasure of Irish Traveller, Romany Gypsy and Roma people's daily experiences of racism and discrimination. ""The letter is utterly inexcusable, and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms. ""We welcome the Labour Party's swift response and call on all parties and government to review their anti-racism strategies, to ensure everyone can live free from racist hate."" A Labour Party spokesman said: ""The Labour Party completely condemns these comments, which are deeply offensive and wrong. ""The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Diane Abbott pending an investigation."" The party declined to comment on when an investigation would begin, or who would lead it. Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called the comments ""simply unacceptable"" during St George's day celebrations at Trafalgar Square in London. He said: ""There is no place in our society, let alone the Labour Party, for anybody with these comments - Labour Party, Keir Starmer has done the right thing by suspending Diane Abbott. ""It's really important that everyone understands that there is no hierarchy when it comes to racism. Racism is racism - whether it's against Jewish people, travellers or anybody else"". Sir Keir promised tough action to ""root out"" antisemitism when he became leader in 2020. It took years before the EHRC said in February that it was now satisfied with Labour's action on the issue.

CBI rape allegations shocking says Labour shadow minister," Allegations of rape and sexual assault at the CBI are ""absolutely shocking"", a Labour shadow minister said as firms continue to cut ties with the lobby group. Dozens of firms have said they are leaving the group or pausing their membership due to the allegations. The CBI has said it is suspending key activities until June while it seeks to ""refocus"". But some business leaders have said the CBI's brand could be ""beyond repair"". The lobbying group has been rocked by the allegations, with a second woman claiming she was raped by CBI colleagues in a Guardian article on Friday. The police were investigating an alleged rape at a CBI summer party in 2019 before the Guardian reported the second incident. There have also been allegations of other sexual misconduct. On Sunday, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth stopped short of calling for the group to be disbanded, instead saying it needed ""root and branch"" reform. ""The revelations, the stories, have just been absolutely shocking, haven't they?"" he said. ""I feel for the people who have been victims."" He added there are ""clearly deep-rooted problems"" at the group and it needs a ""root and branch review and reform process"". Both the government and the Labour Party have cut ties with the CBI for now. A waves of firms has withdrawn support from the lobbying group. Firms that have quit include: John Lewis, BMW, Virgin Media O2, Vodafone, insurers Aviva, Zurich and Phoenix Group, banking firm Natwest, payments company Mastercard; B&Q owner Kingfisher; media firm ITV; insurance marketplace Lloyds of London; investment firm Schroders; auditor EY; catering giant Compass; consultants Accenture; and outsourcing giant Capita. The Association of British Insurers and the British Insurance Brokers' Association have also left, as has Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers. Organisations that have suspended membership include: pharmaceutical giants GSK and AstraZeneca; airports operator Heathrow; retailers Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, and Marks & Spencer; banking group Santander; National Grid, Octopus Energy and Scottish Power; drinks giant Diageo; Rolls Royce; Unilever; BT; property company British Land; accountancy giant PwC; Manpower Group; British Beer and Pub Association; Shell and BP; Nissan; Royal Mail; Uber; Facebook owner Meta; Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment; Nurofen maker Reckitt; British American Tobacco; and FTSE 100 hotel group IHG which owns Holiday Inn. The CBI - which employs more than 300 people - said on Friday it would suspend key activities and launch a review of its future role. Andy Wood, the boss of brewer Adnams, told the BBC on Saturday the CBI brand was probably ""beyond repair"", and it would have to ""reinvent itself root and branch"".

"SNP most transparent party in Scotland, Keith Brown says"," The SNP is the most transparent party in Scotland, according to its deputy leader Keith Brown. The former minister made the remark as he defended his party's record amid internal turmoil and a police investigation into finances. He also said the SNP membership has increase by more than 700 since last month. Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said Mr Brown was ""living in a parallel universe"". Last month Peter Murrell resigned as the SNP's chief executive after taking responsibility for misleading the media about party membership numbers. Treasurer Colin Beattie also stepped down. Both had been arrested and released without charge as part of the Police Scotland probe. Mr Brown pointed to how the SNP's new leader Humza Yousaf had ordered a governance and transparency review. ""So action has been taken to make sure that we meet these internal challenges,"" he told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show. ""And in the meantime, we are one of the most transparent parties in the UK. You will have a very good idea of what the SNP membership is."" He continued: ""We are a more transparent, more successful party than any other party in Scotland. We have to increase that transparency. ""It is my ambition and I know that it is Humza's to make sure we are the most transparent party in Scotland and that we set the standard for transparency and shame the other parties."" The SNP's deputy leader also pointed to Scottish Labour and Conservative politicians declining to say how many members the parties have. Mr Brown said SNP membership had risen over the past two to three months, based on reports from SNP branches on social media. ""We've seen upticks in membership across the country,"" he told the Sunday Show. ""We've seen upticks in terms of donations."" The former minister added: ""And I would also just balance that by saying yes, we have lost members as well, but the balance is showing an increase in membership."" In March the SNP confirmed their membership figure had fallen to 72,000 - a loss of 32,000 in two years. Later on Sunday Mr Brown told BBC Scotland that the figure has increase by 738 since 24 March, three days before Mr Yousaf was named as leader. On Saturday, the SNP appointed MP Stuart McDonald as treasurer until the party's next annual conference. He said he would work with Mr Yousaf ""to improve the SNP's governance and transparency"". A key task for the new treasurer will be appointing auditors after accountants Johnston Carmichael, which worked with the SNP for more than a decade, resigned around September. The party's accounts are due to be filed to the Electoral Commission in July. In an earlier interview with Sky News, Mr Brown said he had not been notified until recently that the auditors had quit. Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy claimed the SNP ""is addicted to secrecy"". He told the Sunday Show: ""It was bizarre to hear Keith Brown saying the SNP is one of the most transparent political parties in the UK. ""I mean he's living in a parallel universe there."" Asked to reveal how many members Scottish Labour has, MSP Daniel Johnson told the Sunday Show ""the key questions here are for the SNP"". He added: ""For Keith Brown to say they are the most transparent in the UK when he didn't even know that the auditors had quit for months I think really demonstrates the real issue. ""The reality is the Labour Party is not the one looking at being unable to file its accounts and therefore not complying with electoral law."" In fairness to Keith Brown, it is true that rival parties in Scotland have been reticent about their membership figures. That may well be in part because they are still dwarfed by the SNP's rank and file, regardless of a recent exodus. But it is just a bit of a stretch to suggest that everything is rosy in the garden. A new treasurer has been parachuted in with the clock running down on efforts to find a new auditor in time to file accounts with the Electoral Commission. Humza Yousaf's attempts at a fresh start have been repeatedly buffeted by events outwith his control, as well as a series of ""did you know about this?"" questions to which the answer is invariably ""no"". The narrative around the leadership style of his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon is fast swinging from ""strong and stable"" to ""closed off and remote"". Mr Brown must recognise some frustration on that front himself - he led a transparency review in 2021 which seems to have been roundly ignored by party bigwigs. And all of that is regardless of the ongoing police investigation, which is the subject of endless speculation at Holyrood - essentially all of it uninformed. Police Scotland launched its Operation Branchform investigation into the SNP's finances in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how more than £600,000 of donations earmarked for independence campaigning were spent. A person who reported concerns to Police Scotland in March 2021 has told the Herald on Sunday there should be an inquiry into how the force ""dragged its feet"" in responding to his complaint. The man, who was not been named, said he had to lodge another complaint in January this year due to a lack of progress. Meanwhile the Sunday Mail and Scottish Mail on Sunday have reported officers are searching for sim cards linked to pay-as-you-go phones as part of the case. Police are also investigating the purchase of jewellery, a fridge-freezer, ""luxury"" pens and designer pots and pans, according to the reports. BBC News has approached Police Scotland about all three reports. The force said it was unable to comment further on the investigation. On reports about pay-as-you-go phones, the SNP said: ""We have no comment on a live police investigation."" Mr Murrell, who is married to former SNP leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, was arrested about two weeks ago at the couple's home in Glasgow. He was released without charge pending further inquiries. Officers spent two days searching the house, and also searched the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh. Mr Beattie was taken into custody and released without charge on Tuesday. Mr Yousaf described his decision to resign as ""the right thing to do"".

Welsh language error in government emergency alert," A UK-wide emergency alert test sent to mobile phones on Sunday included a Welsh language error. For the words ""others safe"", the message read ""eraill yn Vogel"" when it should have been ""eraill yn ddiogel"". ""Vogel"" has no meaning in Welsh, as there is no letter V in the Welsh alphabet. It means bird in German and a ski resort in Slovenia is named Vogel. The UK government blamed a ""technical error"" for the mistake and said this would be rectified in future. The message appeared on the home screens of mobile phones and tablets at 15:00 BST, accompanied by a loud siren-like sound lasting about 10 seconds. Some people reported getting three separate alerts, while others have complained of not receiving one at all. The UK government said the new system is a ""vital tool to keep the public safe in life-threatening emergencies"". It will be used in cases of flooding, wildfires or terror attacks. A UK government spokesperson said: ""A technical error caused one word in the Welsh language version of the emergency test alert to be misspelt.

"NHS Wales is not functional, says BMA head Iona Collins"," Wales does not have a functioning NHS and people do not have faith in it, claims the head of a doctors' union. Dr Iona Collins, of the British Medical Association in Wales, said people suffering with chest pain ""don't even know"" if an ambulance will come. Latest figures show a higher percentage of people are waiting two years or more for treatment in Wales than England. The Welsh government said it's spending more to help the NHS recover from the pandemic and cut waiting times. One patient who has given up waiting for a hip replacement will travel to Lithuania for treatment on Monday, paying £10,000. Nicky Morris from Aberaman, Rhondda Cynon Taf, waited 18 months before she saw a consultant. She was shocked when she then called her local hospital, the Royal Glamorgan in Llantrisant, for an update and said she was told no orthopaedic operations had been performed there since 2020. Mrs Morris asked: ""'Am I safe to say that in two years' time is when you're going to be catching up?"", and said the person she spoke to could not even say that would be the case. But time is not on Mrs Morris's side, as she has a muscle wasting condition which means delaying the operation could mean she would never be able to walk again. She will go to Lithuania to get the hip operation done privately, which is costing her £10,000 and has meant her partner has had to take out a loan on his house. ""It's going to take me five years to pay off this hip replacement, and yet for 35 years I've paid National Insurance, I've paid my taxes. I've never been out of work, never needed the NHS more than I do now,"" she said. Mrs Morris added: ""If I don't go to Lithuania and I wait for the operation, I've got the potential that my underlying condition will now get to the point where I have no muscle to actually walk. ""If I'm no longer able to have surgery, that's it. My life will be over at 52."" Figures for February show more than 37,000 people are waiting more than two years for treatment in Wales, around 5% of those waiting. That is down from around 60,000 last July, or 8% of the total. But the figures for England are much lower, currently standing at 0.014%. Dr Collins told BBC Politics Wales that despite the fall in numbers, Mrs Morris's case was ""a symptom of failure,"" and the situation was desperate. ""We do not have a functioning service now. People do not have faith in the service,"" she said. ""If you have chest pain you don't even know if an ambulance is necessarily going to come. We see really tragic reports in the press where people arrive too late."" However, Mark Dayan from the health think tank the Nuffield Trust, said there had been some improvement. ""If you look at figures from the last few months, on the one hand there has been some progress in a number of things in waiting times in Wales,"" he said. ""They've actually improved for urgent care, and at the same time the gap for the average person on the waiting list has shrunk with England. ""However, when you compare Wales to Scotland and England, the absolute amount of time that people are waiting is still considerably longer, particularly at the longest end."" On the different figures for the longer waiting lists, he added: ""It's probably true that the health services in England and Scotland have put a particularly aggressive emphasis on cutting off the longer waiters first, and had some success in doing that. ""But it's not indisputably a good thing, because actually there is a really difficult moral choice to make between the person who's been on the list for longest and the person who actually needs care most."" Age Cymru head of policy Heather Ferguson said: ""There is much that can be done to reduce the effects of long waiting times such as clinicians providing their patients with advice on waiting well to help prevent conditions deteriorating. ""We are worried that if older people are forced to wait too long for their procedures that their condition will deteriorate, leading to a loss of self-confidence, and a gradual withdrawal from life."" On the thousands of people waiting more than two years for surgery, Health Minister Eluned Morgan told Politics Wales: ""If you look at the percentage drop, in particular, for those longest waits, we're now 47% down on where we were this time last year. ""Now, we've got a long way to go and what we do know is the way that we count our waiting lists is very different from England."" In April 2022, the Welsh government published a new strategy to reduce the number of people waiting for an NHS operation. The first target around outpatient appointments was missed and it is on course to also miss the second target of eliminating the number of people waiting more than two years in most specialities by March 2023. Asked if the Welsh government needs to revisit its strategy, Ms Morgan replied: ""I think it's very important that we set very stretching targets for the health boards. ""We've galvanised the health boards to really focus on that. They haven't gone as quickly as we'd like, they haven't perhaps prioritised in the way that we hoped in terms of the longest waits and we have regular meetings with them to really push them. ""It took a long time to get started and we're now in a situation where the system is moving through these waiting lists a lot quicker than they were at the start of the process,"" she added. In March, ambulance response times were the second worst on record, with only 47.5% of immediately life-threatening ""red"" calls attended to within the target eight minutes. It was the 32nd month in a row where the target to reach 65% of emergency calls within eight minutes was not met. Ms Morgan said: ""I think what we need to recognise is the massive increase that we've seen in terms of demands on the most urgent cases. We've seen a 93% increase in red calls since 2019. ""80% of those red calls are answered within 15 minutes. Now, that's not our target. ""It's still not good enough and we still need to do better and that's why we're ploughing money in to the Welsh ambulance service,"" she added. On Dr Collins's comments, a Welsh government spokesperson added: ""We are proud of our NHS, the first universal health system of its kind. ""We have committed more than £1bn extra this Senedd term to help the NHS recover from the pandemic and cut waiting times. ""We are working with health boards and have set ambitious but realistic targets to tackle the pandemic backlog for planned care, backed by significant extra long-term funding.""

"Dominic Raab's exit must not lower standards, says deputy PM"," Dominic Raab's replacement as deputy PM has insisted that ministers must be able to demand the ""highest standards"" from civil servants. Oliver Dowden said Mr Raab's exit after a bullying inquiry should not stop ministers holding officials to account. But he distanced himself from claims from Mr Raab that civil servants were frustrating the work of government. And he admitted the process for dealing with complaints needed to be ""fairer"". Mr Raab stood down on Friday after a report written by lawyer Adam Tolley KC found he was ""intimidating"" and ""aggressive"" towards officials. However, he hit out at the report's findings, saying they set ""a very dangerous precedent"" and would have a ""chilling effect"" on how minsters work. He also claimed there was a risk ""a very small minority"" of officials ""with a passive aggressive culture"" were trying to block reforms they did not like. Asked about Mr Raab's comments on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Dowden said ministers had all ""experienced frustrations"" during their time working with officials in government. But he told the show: ""It has not been my experience working with civil servants that we can't work together in a constructive way. I haven't experienced that."" He added: ""What I would not want to become the outcome of this is there is some kind of diminution in the ability of ministers to expect the highest standards"". He also said that the government wanted to look at the process for how officials can raise complaints about the behaviour or ministers, saying there was a need to make it ""simpler, fairer and less complex"". Meanwhile, a Tory peer who is leading a government review of how the civil service operates has called for a more ""robust culture"" in Whitehall. Writing in the Observer, Lord Francis Maude, a former Cabinet Office minister, raised the prospect of civil servants being able to have more open political affiliations. He said ministers have limited authority to put in place officials of their choice despite relying on them and being accountable for what they do. He suggested that ministers could be given more say about appointments while preserving impartiality. ""The UK is now an outlier, and a better balance needs to be struck,"" he said, adding that without change, ""there will be more cases like Raab's when frustrations boil over"". He said that other governments with similar systems, such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, ""manage it better than us"". ""In France, permanent civil servants often have overt political affiliations, and it causes few problems,"" he added. Mr Tolley's inquiry looked at eight formal complaints about Mr Raab's behaviour during his previous stints as justice secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary. His report concluded Mr Raab's conduct involved ""an abuse or misuse of power"", and that he ""acted in a manner which was intimidating"" and ""persistently aggressive"" towards officials. The FDA union, which represents civil servants, dismissed Mr Raab's comments that some officials were frustrating the work of government, accused him of peddling ""dangerous conspiracy theories that undermine the impartiality and integrity of the civil service"". On Sunday the Liberal Democrats, who have already called on Mr Raab to step down as an MP, said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should suspend him as a Conservative MP.

"Emergency alert could be sound that saves your life, says deputy PM"," An emergency alert being tested later could be the sound that ""saves your life"", the UK's deputy prime minister has said. People across the UK will hear a loud alarm on their phones for about 10 seconds on Sunday at 15:00 BST. Oliver Dowden said no action from the public will be needed, although some sporting events and theatre shows will be paused during the test event. The new system will be used in cases of flooding, wildfires or terror attacks. Mr Dowden reassured people they should not be concerned and will be able to ""keep calm and carry on"" with their day after getting the test alert on their 4G and 5G devices. ""It really is the sound that could save your life,"" the new deputy prime minister added. He denied the testing of a new emergency national alert system on Sunday was an example of so-called nanny statism. ""I wouldn't accept that characterisation,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. He said the test of the system was a ""bit like when the fire alarm goes off at work"". He said: ""It can be a bit inconvenient and annoying. ""I think, in future, people will be grateful that we tested the system and what I would say is that at 3pm, when this siren - which I should say is about the volume of a phone call going off - goes off, you don't need to do anything. ""It is just a test."" He said: ""The government's number one job is to keep people safe and this is another tool in the toolkit for emergency situations, such as flooding or wildfires, and where there is a genuine risk to life. ""So it really is the sound that could save your life. ""I would encourage people to remember that today it is just a test; there is no need to take any action and you can simply swipe it away as you would any other message you receive."" Those who do not wish to receive the alerts will be able to opt out in their device settings, while phones that are off or in aeroplane mode will also not receive one. Ellie Butt, from the domestic abuse charity Refuge, is urging women who feel at risk to disable the alert.She said: ""One in four women will experience domestic abuse in her lifetime... so it's safe to assume that there are a significant number of people that need to know that their safety might be at risk from these alerts, and they can opt out and turn them off."" The test message will say: ""This is a test of Emergency Alerts, a new UK government service that will warn you if there's a life-threatening emergency nearby. ""In a real emergency, follow the instructions in the alert to keep yourself and others safe. ""Visit gov.uk/alerts for more information. ""This is a test. You do not need to take any action."" People will then be prompted to swipe or click the message before being able to continue. The test on St George's Day coincides with major events including the London Marathon and Premier League games between Bournemouth and West Ham, and Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur, which kick off at 14:00. Organisers of the World Snooker Championship have said they will pause play just before 15:00 at the Crucible in Sheffield and will continue it after the alert. The Society of London Theatre also said it had advised members to tell people to turn off their phones to ""minimise disruption to shows"". West End shows such as Harry Potter And The Cursed Child, Frozen, Mamma Mia! and The Lion King are among those putting on matinees on Sunday.

NHS dentistry crisis: Crowdfunding my new teeth has changed my life," A woman who extracted her own teeth because she couldn't find an NHS dentist says crowdfunding a new set of dentures has transformed her life. On Tuesday afternoon, MPs will question dental experts from NHS England as part of an official inquiry prompted by a BBC investigation into the dentistry crisis. One by one, over several months, Danielle Watts pulled out 13 of her own teeth. For years she had been living with terrible pain and discomfort as a result of chronic gum disease, which meant that her teeth - otherwise healthy and unaffected by decay - were becoming loose and falling out. But Ms Watts, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, found herself in a ""dental desert"" - an area where no dentists offer NHS care - and couldn't afford the thousands of pounds of private treatment needed to fix her teeth. Now, a crowdfunding campaign has helped raise enough money to let her have a set of dentures fitted - meaning she can smile again. ""I've got a mouthful of teeth, which feels amazing,"" Ms Watts says. ""I'm not ashamed any more."" The BBC featured her story last year - when our research revealed the extent to which people across the UK were struggling to access NHS dentistry. The Covid pandemic had left dental practices with severe backlogs of patients needing appointments, and this exacerbated an NHS funding gap which meant dentists had to take on more private work to survive. Our research showed: Following our investigation, the Health and Social Care Committee launched an inquiry into dentistry, and the cross-party committee is due to hear evidence from senior NHS England and government figures on Tuesday. The Department of Health in England says improving NHS access is a priority, and that it has made an extra £50m available ""to help bust the Covid backlogs"" - but tens of thousands of people, like Ms Watts, are still struggling to find an NHS dentist. Last August, she described how she no longer smiled at people and had stopped going out and socialising. ""I won't go out and meet new people. I avoid crowded situations. I walk with my head down all the time,"" she told us. Describing herself as ""quite a happy, smiley person"", she said she would hang her head to hide her mouth when she laughed in front of people, ""because I know what they're seeing"". At the time, Ms Watts's despair was striking. ""I'm 42 years old and I can't eat and drink. I'm on painkillers every day. I'm not a 90-year-old woman. This shouldn't be happening to me now,"" she said. Not only was eating increasingly difficult, but her damaged gums were also at risk of infection. In fact, late last year she was hospitalised for three weeks after one such infection got out of control. But following our report, a friend persuaded her to set up a crowdfunding page to see if they could raise the money to get her teeth fixed. It raised about £2,500, which - along with some funds raised by her mother's church - was enough to get Ms Watts fitted with a set of dentures. She says the kindness of strangers has completely transformed her life. ""I'm in no pain at all, there is no bleeding, my teeth are all facing the same way,"" she says. ""I don't have to hide anymore. To be able to talk to somebody face-on, to be able to smile at somebody, is something I haven't done for several years."" Disappearing dentists Some people are going to extraordinary measures to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Ms Watts knows she is extremely lucky - and that not everyone will be able to benefit from the sort of crowdfunding campaign that helped her. ""Part of me feels bad because there are so many people who are in my position, but they haven't had that help - so I feel very guilty as well as being incredibly grateful."" She says she feels especially privileged because people donated money during a cost-of-living crisis. ""People still put their hands in their pockets and gave what they could - it's absolutely massive."" ",712,health,2023-04-25T01:27:05.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65336571
Photo exhibition chronicles the cost of dying," The cost of dying for those already facing financial pressure is the subject of a new photo exhibition. Terminally-ill patients allowed award-winning photographer Margaret Mitchell to chronicle their final weeks alive. The subjects and their loved ones also recorded their struggles as they navigated money worries and illness. The free exhibition, which has just opened at the University of Glasgow, is the culmination of a four-year study into end-of-life financial pressures. The aim was to allow participants to tell their own story in words and images. Stacey, 39,  lived with a rare hereditary genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which makes a person susceptible to developing cancer. She lived with her partner and her mother in a one-bedroom high-rise flat in Glasgow. Taxi fares for medical treatment were a burden. ""I'm in the health centre for blood Monday, that's £20. Then to get injections Tuesday - £25. Then to see my surgeon on Thursday at the hospital -£20,"" she described. Stacey's partner Joost took unpaid leave from his job to care for Stacey and said they struggled financially. He told BBC Scotland: ""In the last month at home, it was three people in one house and that was crowded. ""Stacey's mum had to sleep in the living room on a couch and we had the bed."" Stacey died recently. A love for fashion and dress-making allowed Liz to create a haven where she felt comfortable. She knew her own flat was not perfect. Her photographs document the black mould in her bedroom and a leaky ceiling. She knew people might see it as ""cluttered"" but it was home to her. Following a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer, Liz struggled to get support. She was estranged from her family and lived alone. She had a partner but they did not live together as she faced her own health issues. She visited charity, vintage clothes shops and the Mitchell library, partly for warmth but also for conversation. Her religious faith also provided solace. ""I've survived with using the radio. When I can't get to church, I listen to this,"" she explained in handwritten notes. In her final days, faced with reductions in her care package due to staff shortages, she accepted a hospice bed. For army veteran Max, remaining at home for the end of his life was a priority. He had experienced homelessness and struggled with institutions. He wanted to be in his local community with friends and his dog, Lily. ""I prefer being at home. No one wants to be in a hospital. I want to do my own thing,"" he said. His home was unfit for his needs, with four sets of stairs and a bath he could not climb into. He was moved into a hospice by concerned carers but before long Max made ""a great escape"", according to his friends. ""He did a runner from the hospice basically to get back to his dog,"" they recalled. With their help and support from his care team, Max was able to stay at home with Lily until the last week of his life. Having grown up in the city, 64-year-old Margaret attributed her cancer diagnosis to pollution. She had lived on a busy road and worked above a bus station for years. She said: ""We went to school in the peasouper. You were all holding onto each other, it was so thick. You couldn't see anything"". Margaret left home aged 16 and worked throughout her life. Following her diagnosis, her main concern was making sure her teenage daughter was financially taken care of when she was gone. With the help of a hospice social worker, Margaret tried to check which benefits she would be eligible for.  She was upset when she discovered she would not be able to access her pension. ""I've never claimed unemployment benefits, ever. Talking about national insurance stamps, I'm fully booked up. I'm going to lose my old-age pension which I never, ever received"". When 53-year-old Andy arrived at the hospice, he was concerned about naming his estranged family in his admission forms in case they were left burdened with his funeral costs. His diagnosis of throat cancer made it hard for him to communicate. He was very sick and ""simply wanted to die"". Hospice staff were able to help Andy reunite with his family - his daughter and a granddaughter he never knew he had. The photos that Andy contributed to the exhibition show bags of food his daughter brought him in the hospice. Photographer Margaret Mitchell noticed a jar with sticky notes by his bedside. Andy explained that he was writing notes to leave to his granddaughter when he was gone. The Cost of Dying exhibition is the culmination of a four-year University of Glasgow study, called Dying in the Margins. By 2040, it is estimated that up to 10,000 more people than now, will be dying with end-of-life support needs in Scotland. Researcher Dr Naomi Richards said: ""We worked very intimately and closely with our research participants to try to get a  sense of their lives - things that give them meaning and the struggles they are having because they are experiencing financial hardship and deprivation."" Participants told of struggles with income as they were unable to work. Common themes were costs of travel for medical care, utility bills as they spent more time at home and worries about funeral costs. ""The participants were all given cameras and were asked to document through photographs the things that were important to them and the struggles they were having,"" she said. Professional photographer Margaret Mitchell was also asked to create a body of work reflecting their stories and emotions. ""It was a really challenging project but at the same time that's really rewarding because you feel like you're going to perhaps make a form of legacy for them,"" she said. ""When people come along to see it, hopefully it's a way of entering peoples lives and trying to understand the situations that they're in at this time and also some of the issues that are being raised by that."" The Cost of Dying exhibition runs from 25 April to 5 May, open to visitors from 9:00 am to 17:00 and on Saturday from10:00 to 16:00 at the Advanced Research Centre (ARC) at The University of Glasgow ",1051,uk,2023-04-24T22:14:53.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-65354687
Cancer survivor 'thrilled' after running London Marathon on crutches," A man who ran the London Marathon on crutches has thanked friends and family for helping raise thousands of pounds for charity. Adam Lever, from Beeston, Nottinghamshire, completed the famous course on Sunday, 12 years after being diagnosed with cancer. The 30-year-old covered the 26.2-mile (42.1km) run in five hours, 42 minutes and 55 seconds. He has raised more than £13,000 for the Bone Cancer Research Trust. Mr Lever, a sports disability support officer at the University of Nottingham, had to learn to walk again after undergoing an operation to remove a tumour in his leg. He said he was recovering well after finishing the gruelling run. ""I'm a bit sore, particularly in my upper body and shoulders and my feet, but my legs are feeling quite fresh,"" he said. ""I feel pretty ecstatic really - it was a mammoth challenge yesterday, but there's a lot of relief to finish it, and I'm still on cloud nine."" Mr Lever had set a target of completing the marathon in less than six hours, a feat he said he was ""thrilled"" to achieve. His time also beat the current world record for a marathon on crutches by more than 40 minutes, though he said he will need to make an application to Guinness World Records to make it official. ""In my training my target was to go under six hours, and I was feeling good yesterday so I'm really happy to do it,"" he said. ""Once I started I sort of knew I was on for a good time, so I'm really thrilled. ""We learned about the record quite late on... I suppose it's an unofficial record at the moments, but we'll put in an application for it, which would be excellent for awareness for the charity."" Mr Lever said he would wait and see how he recovers before deciding if he will take on any further marathons or fundraising events. Having already raised well over his original target of £10,000, he paid tribute to friends and family for their ""incredible"" efforts in helping him train and hosting a variety of events to bring in donations. ""We've blown it out of the park,"" he said. ""If all weekends could be like this it would be great."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Ministers in legal move to cut nurse strike short," Health Secretary Steve Barclay is to ask judges to rule whether all 48 hours of the next nurse strike is lawful. The government wants the High Court to assess whether Tuesday - the last day of the walkout in England - falls outside the Royal College of Nursing's six-month mandate for action. It believes the mandate will have lapsed by Tuesday - the 48-hour strike is due to start at 20:00 BST on Sunday. The RCN accused ministers of using ""draconian anti-union legislation"". ""The only way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them - including in court,"" said RCN general secretary Pat Cullen. ""It's so wrong for the government to use taxpayers' payers money to drag our profession through the courts."" But she said if the courts found in favour of the government she would have no option but to cut the walkout short. Mr Barclay's decision to take legal action follows a request from hospital bosses. The RCN argues the strike falls within the required six-month period from when votes were cast in its ballot for industrial action. But NHS Employers said it had legal advice that the action would be unlawful. NHS Employers says it believes ballots closed at midday on 2 November 2022, meaning action on 2 May - the last day of the planned strike - would not be covered by the strike mandate. It had argued that could invalidate the whole strike, but the government is now just contesting the part of the strike that falls on the 2 May, the Tuesday. Mr Barclay said: ""Despite attempts by my officials to resolve the situation over the weekend, I have been left with no choice but to proceed with legal action. ""I firmly support the right to take industrial action within the law - but the government cannot stand by and let a plainly unlawful strike action go ahead nor ignore the request of NHS Employers. We must also protect nurses by ensuring they are not asked to take part in an unlawful strike."" The RCN rejected a government pay offer for England of a 5% pay rise for 2023-24 and a one-off payment of at least £1,655 to top up last year's salary, depending on staff grade. The union announced its members had rejected the offer by 54% to 46%. If the court finds the strike to be unlawful, the RCN said it would have to accept the judgement as it would ""never do anything illegal"". The planned walkout from 20:00 BST on 30 April to 20:00 BST on 2 May will involve NHS nurses in emergency departments, intensive care, cancer wards and other wards. Nurses have already walked out twice this year - on 6 and 7 February and on 18 and 19 January - but on those dates there were exemptions, so nursing cover was maintained in critical areas. The government has said strike action with no national exemptions would put patients at risk. ",494,health,2023-04-24T17:17:47.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65380381
Anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists plotted to destroy 5G masts - court," Two anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists plotted to destroy 5G masts and called for MPs to be hanged, a court heard. Darren Reynolds and Christine Grayson discussed armed uprisings and advocated violence towards those they called ""traitors"", Leeds Crown Court was told. Mr Reynolds, 60, ""went further"" and posted extreme right-wing, anti-Semitic and racist views, jurors heard. Both defendants deny encouraging terrorism and conspiracy to cause criminal damage. Mr Reynolds, of Newbould Crescent, Sheffield, also denies disseminating terrorist publications and possessing documents containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Prosecutor Tom Storey told jurors the defendants knew each other through the social media platform Telegram, which both used regularly between 2020 and 2022. Mr Storey said the pair subscribed to a conspiracy theory involving 5G mobile phone masts being linked to the Covid-19 vaccine, adding: ""They overtly discussed the potential destruction of 5G masts, both in principle and by reference to specific masts which they felt should be targeted."" The defendants' views ""crossed the line"" from expressing opinions to ""overtly advocating the use of violence towards those whom they regarded as traitors"", the jury was told. A crossbow and a number of bolts were found when police searched 59-year-old Ms Grayson's property on Boothwood Road in York. Officers found two replica assault rifles at Mr Reynolds' address. The court heard both defendants were strongly opposed to the rollout of the 5G network and regarded 5G masts as pieces of ""enemy infrastructure which they were entitled to disable or destroy"". Posting online on 29 June 2021, Mr Reynolds wrote: ""Storm Parliament and the Lords, drag them all outside and hang them all on the spot for treason."" The following June, Ms Grayson posted: ""It's still lawful to hang for treason."" Mr Storey said the ""terrorist publications"" Mr Reynolds was accused of sharing included a manifesto written by Anders Breivik - who was responsible for murdering some 69 people at a youth summer camp in Norway in 2011. The court heard Ms Grayson denied having any intention to criminally damage 5G masts, telling police any comments she may have made to that effect were made in jest. Mr Storey said Mr Reynolds felt that all his communications were ""lawful, given his right to freedom of speech"". The trial continues. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Bristol hospital staff report patient violence and aggression," About 300 staff at a health trust have suffered violence or aggression in the last six months, hospital bosses say. University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Trust (UHBW) said they are working with police on 37 active criminal investigations, with a further 29 cases already being prosecuted. They said two victim support officers had been employed to help staff. Emma Wood, UHBW chief people officer, said it was important that staff felt confident to report incidents. More than half of the reports (58%) are from the trust's medicine division, which includes the Bristol Royal Infirmary emergency department.This is followed by 17% at Weston General Hospital, 11% in the surgery division and 6% in women's and children's services. Speaking at the trust's board meeting on 18 April, Ms Wood said: ""Incidents of verbal or physical abuse can have a devastating impact on the hardworking staff who experience them."" She said while it was ""very unusual"" for the organisation to take so many alleged perpetrators to court, it was important that staff felt incidents would be taken seriously, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.""We know that there will be occasions when patients become confused or stressed in unfamiliar environments which can lead to challenging behaviour - and staff are trained to deal with this.""But there are also many incidents where people are simply abusive, and this is not okay,"" she added.

School tutoring: One third of £594m post-lockdown cash unspent," About one third of the £594m earmarked for tutoring to help children catch up after Covid lockdowns has gone unspent, a BBC investigation has found. The government's National Tutoring Programme (NTP) offers one-to-one or group lessons outside of school hours. Schools must top up any government money from their own budgets, something some teachers say they cannot afford. The government said it had helped millions of children - but Labour called the scheme a ""shocking failure"". Almost £209m of the £594.3m allocated to the NTP for the previous two academic years has not been spent, according to a BBC Freedom of Information request. The scheme, launched in November 2020, provides primary and secondary schools with funding to subsidise tutoring. Any money not spent each academic year is returned to the Treasury. Charles Barnett, assistant head teacher at Wensleydale School and Sixth Form, welcomed the initial idea but said it took ""a very short amount of time to realise it wouldn't work effectively for us"". ""Both cost versus impact, they just didn't add up for us,"" he said. ""And then we couldn't reach enough students with what they were offering in the ways that they were offering it, and there simply wasn't the choice for us as a small rural school to tap into that offer."" The latest Department for Education (DfE) data estimates that 66% of schools in England have participated in the NTP this academic year, as of January. London has the highest rates of participation, at 73%. The lowest is seen in the North East, at 62%. In the 21-22 academic year, 87% of schools in England used the scheme. Ellen Widdup from Woodbridge has three children, aged 7, 13 and 15. She told BBC Radio Suffolk that as a single parent, she was working full time throughout the pandemic, making home schooling impossible. Ellen said her children definitely fell behind. ""I think that this offer from the government was brilliant in terms of helping children get back on track,"" she said. ""I just think it's awful that all that money is  now going back to the government when it could've been spent."" Dr Rebecca Montacute, head of research and policy at education charity Sutton Trust, said participation had been higher in cities where there were already ""a lot more agencies operating or charities that were trying to get tutoring to disadvantaged students"". The NTP covered 75% of costs for school-led tutoring in the 21-22 academic year. This year, it provides 60%. In September, it is planned to drop to 25% for the 2023-24 academic year. Dr Montacute said reducing the subsidy could mean schools either ""won't want to or won't be able to"" use the programme. Steve Haines, Director of Public Affairs at youth charity Impetus, said evidence shows tutoring can help pupils make accelerated progress, but ""the NTP will only work if schools are able to use it"". He added pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely ""to pass their GCSE English and maths exams, and we are concerned that unless the government makes the changes necessary for more schools to use the scheme, they will fall behind even further"". The government had initially aimed for 65% of NTP tuition go to disadvantaged pupils. During the 21-22 academic year, 47% of the tuition did. Bridget Phillipson MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, called the scheme a ""shocking failure"". She said: ""The government failed children throughout the pandemic and is failing to prioritise their futures now, with the result that the learning gap between children on free school meals and those not has widened to the biggest gap for a decade."" Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson MP said: ""How can the government claim to be prioritising levelling up while leaving the most disadvantaged children behind?"" When the NTP started in 2020, schools could either work with an external organisation that could provide tutors, or employ an academic mentor who could provide intensive support. Last year, the DfE introduced a third option - letting schools use their own staff. ""At the start it was ineffective,"" said Darren Morgan, head teacher of Manchester's Kings Road Primary. ""But, when the government moved to a more school-based approach, it was amazing."" Mr Morgan has been using the funding to run catch-up groups in maths and English during the holidays and after school. Ria, Owais and Zamzama are in Year 6 at Kings Road Primary. They have been enjoying their tutoring sessions. ""I think it's changed my learning,"" said Ria. ""I used to get low scores but now I'm getting really high scores."" Zamzama said: ""Before sessions, I was feeling really nervous. I was like, 'what if I don't do all right or something like that?' But now I feel I've got confidence again."" 'Schools fell into deficit overnight' Mr Morgan said his pupils had made lots of progress thanks to the NTP but he understands why others have not used it. ""I'm lucky because I'm part of a big school, so I have more of a budget,"" he said. ""But overnight, lots of schools fell into deficit, myself included. Heating bills were going up, everything was increasing. I can understand why it wasn't possible to access the programme."" Despite being a fan of the scheme, Mr Morgan said it was unlikely he can afford to continue it. He said it would cost his school an extra £35,000 from September when the subsidy falls to 25% - and he would rather drop the programme than make a staff member redundant. Dr Montacute said it was understandable that not all the funds had been spent ""given the challenge of being able to scale up a programme like this in the pandemic"". ""Long term, the NTP should be seen as a core part of the fabric of the school system specifically to tackle the attainment gap between the poorest and the richest young people,"" she added. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said the programme had delivered tutoring at unprecedented scale and ""millions of children have benefited"". ""With exam season approaching, I hope that every eligible school will take advantage of the scheme this term to provide pupils who need additional help with one-to-one or small group tuition.""

Teenagers at risk after drop in vaccine take-up," Teenagers could be at risk of rare diseases after a drop-off in vaccinations during the Covid pandemic, UK health officials are warning. In 2021-22, 69% of 13 and 14-year-olds received a jab protecting against tetanus, diphtheria and polio - down 7% on the previous year. Another vaccine, against meningitis, also saw a similar fall in uptake. Parents are being urged to make sure young people are up to date with their vaccines before they leave school. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said many of those who had missed out on vaccines because of school closures in the pandemic had now been immunised. But vaccine coverage remains below pre-pandemic levels. UKHSA consultant epidemiologist Dr Vanessa Saliba said children and young people who had missed out on their teenage vaccines should contact their school nurse, school immunisation team or GP surgery to arrange a catch-up. ""These vaccines offer the best protection as young people start their journey into adulthood and mixing more widely - whether going to college, starting work, travelling or going to summer festivals,"" she said. The three-in-one booster against tetanus, diphtheria and polio is free on the NHS to all 14-year-olds, through their school. It is also given to babies at eight weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks old, and before they go to school. All five doses are crucial for building up long-term protection. The MenACWY vaccine is also routinely offered to teenagers of the same age, but anyone up to the age of 25 can still get it through their GP. It protects against four strains of meningitis. Before the pandemic, uptake for these vaccines was nearly 88% in England, but latest figures show that dipped to 69% for 13 to 14-year-olds in 2021-22. Uptake among Year 10 school pupils, who are aged 14 to 15, was higher at about 78% which shows more children are catching up on missed jabs. Steve Russell, national director for vaccination and screening, said the vaccines were ""extremely well-researched"" and proven to provide protection against a range of serious diseases. The HPV vaccine is also offered in secondary schools and protects against a range of cancers. ""We strongly urge those eligible and their family members and guardians to ensure they are up to date, and if not to come forward for their vaccines as soon as possible - it's the best way to keep you protected,"" he said. Last week the UN agency Unicef said there were worrying signs that confidence in life-saving childhood vaccines was slipping worldwide, partly because of vaccine hesitancy and disinformation.

Northern Ireland medical negligence costs double in a year," The amount of government money spent on medical negligence cases and legal fees in Northern Ireland doubled within a year. Just over £20m was paid out during 2020-21 but that increased to more than £40m in the 2021-22 financial year. Last year, £30.7m was paid out in damages, while £5.9m went on plaintiff costs and £3.7m in defence costs. The increase in cost is being attributed to the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: ""There was a general decrease in the processing and settling of cases during the main Covid-19 pandemic period, with a subsequent increase in 2021-22."" The annual amount spent on clinical negligence cases prior to the pandemic was about £30m each year. However, in 2020-21 it was much lower than normal, decreasing to £21.9m but increasing again to £40.2m in 2021-22. Figures show that between April 2021 and March 2022, 351 clinical negligence cases were settled, compared with 251 in 2020-21 and 226 in 2019-20. Clinical negligence is defined by the Department of Health as a member of the health and social care service breaching their duty of care. Settlements can relate to legal cases that have been initiated over the course of previous years and not just the year the case was taken. The latest statistics were collected from health and social care trusts and published by the Department of Health. Last year, 3,987 clinical negligence cases were open. Almost half (1,813) of all cases open in 2021-22 related to four specialties: There has been a stark increase in the number of cases relating to neurology in the past five years from 23 in 2017-18 to 407 in 2021-22. The health service in Northern Ireland has been under increased scrutiny in recent years with a number of high-profile reviews making headlines. The Independent Neurology Inquiry was at the centre of Northern Ireland's biggest ever recall of patients. It examined concerns over clinical decision-making, prescribing and diagnostics. Last year Northern Ireland's emergency departments were described as being ""under extreme pressure"". Delays in social care provision have been slowing hospital discharges and having a knock-on effect on the ability of emergency departments to transfer patients to wards. In 2021-22 the highest number of cases related to ""treatment"" in the Belfast, South Eastern and Western health trusts. The highest number of cases in the Northern and Southern trusts related to ""diagnosis and tests"". Over a quarter (£10.6m) of all clinical negligence payments in 2021-22 came from the Western Health Trust. ",415,uk,2023-04-24T05:40:06.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65352193
Greater Manchester firefighters to take part in cancer monitoring project," Life-saving firefighter cancer monitoring is to be launched as part of a UK-wide research project commissioned by the Fire Brigades Union (FBU). The testing is being carried out this week in Greater Manchester by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), led by Professor Anna Stec. A total of 100 firefighters will provide blood and urine samples. Dave Russell, chief fire officer for the region, said it was a ""significant step forward for firefighter safety."" The samples will be analysed for the number of biomarkers of cancers and other diseases, and toxic chemicals. The results will be used to detect cancers and other diseases at the early stages and to identify evidence linking occupational cancers with exposure to toxic fire chemicals. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service is working with the FBU and UCLan to facilitate the testing. Research has found that instances of cancer among UK firefighters aged 35-39 is up to 323% higher than in the general population in the same age category. It also found firefighters were significantly more likely to die from rare cancers, heart attacks and stroke, and several other diseases. Riccardo la Torre, FBU national officer, said: ""We launched the first firefighter health monitoring project of its kind in the UK in February and are proud to now be testing even more firefighters. ""The government and fire service employers have ignored firefighters and their exposures to toxic contaminants for far too long."" He said lack of health monitoring meant cancers were being ""caught tragically late, at much more untreatable stages"" and firefighters were ""dying far too often and far too early"". ""We won't stop until every firefighter in the UK has access to regular health monitoring,"" he added. Prof Stec from UCLan, said it was ""widely accepted that firefighters are dying from rare cancers up to 15-20 years earlier than the general public."" ""It is therefore vital that measures such as health monitoring is introduced so firefighters can be properly protected."" Dave Pike, FBU Greater Manchester brigade secretary, said the project was ""part of our fight for protections from cancers, in the memory of every firefighter we have already lost."" ""Every service across the UK must follow this positive example"", he added. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Care home helps ex-footballer return to sport in Belper," A care home resident in Derbyshire has returned to playing football despite being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Geoff Mansfield, 85, used to play for his local club and told staff at Milford House in Belper it was his wish to play again. He now attends a walking football group at Belper Town Football Club. The home said Mr Mansfield was now more mobile and had a noticeably improved physical and mental wellbeing. Mr Mansfield moved into Milford House when his son needed help with his care. As an ex-footballer for his local team, football had always been his love in life, his family said. After a few months of living at the home, staff there introduced a scheme where residents were encouraged to pick one wish and the workers there could help make it come true. Mr Mansfield's wish was to play football again. Kirsty Swift, the home's dementia care coach, spoke to local associations and found Belper Town Football Club were starting a walking football group. She approached Mr Mansfield about taking part and said he could not wait to get started. He attended his first session in February with the support of family and care home staff. Ms Swift said: ""Geoff was incredible. He was so keen to get involved and soon had the ball at his feet. ""He scored two goals and he even jogged at times,"" Ms Swift said. ""We were so thrilled... I welled up watching him play."" The home has since organised for him to attend sessions every week. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Betsi Cadwaladr: 'Unhelpful' comments about health board," The head of Wales' public spending watchdog wrote to the Welsh government two years ago saying ministers were making ""unhelpful"" comments about north Wales' health board. The auditor general raised concerns about words from previous health minister Vaughan Gething. He implied he ""received direct advice"" from Audit Wales about Betsi Cadwaladr leaving special measures in 2020. Plaid Cymru has called on the Welsh government to set the record straight. But Eluned Morgan, the current health minister, said she would focus on seeing ""improvements happening on the ground in Betsi for the future"". The troubled Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board returned to special measures in February after a string of failings, including on vascular and emergency services. A damning report had heavily criticised the way it was run at the top. The board had been taken out of special measures in 2020, in a move that was heavily criticised by opposition politicians at the time. It is the highest level of government oversight Welsh ministers can impose when trying to fix problems in the NHS. In the Senedd the day after Betsi Cadwaladr returned to special measures, First Minister Mark Drakeford dismissed Plaid Cymru's accusation that the board was taken out of special measures with ""an election looming"". Mr Drakeford said: ""The decision, and it is a decision of ministers, to take the board out of special measures was because we were advised that that is what we should do by the auditor general, by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and by Welsh government officials whose job it is to provide ministers with the advice."" Auditor General Adrian Crompton told Plaid Cymru by letter that his organisation had not given such advice. Replying to a request for clarification from Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, Mr Crompton said: ""In response to your specific question on whether there was advice from me or my staff to the minister to de-escalate the health board from special measures at that time, I can be very clear, there was not."" He explained that Audit Wales shared findings and intelligence from its work through the process that informs Welsh government officials, who advise ministers. However, he did say that in discussions Audit Wales staff did recognise that ""after five years the special measures 'label' itself was increasingly becoming a hindrance to improvement at the health board given its negative effect on crucial areas such as external recruitment, internal engagement, and staff morale"". Plaid Cymru said the first minister had misled the Senedd - a claim denied by Mark Drakeford. In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford said the process on special measures was a ""complicated system for those who are not used to it"". ""It begins with the auditor general, the civil service and Health Inspectorate Wales coming together to discuss whether or not an organisation needs to have any extra intervention,"" he said. ""Separately, civil servants then advise ministers and the third step in this chain is ministers decide."" Speaking in the Senedd following the decision to remove Betsi Cadwaladr from special measures in November 2020, Vaughan Gething, the health minister at the time, said: ""They've considered the extra information that has been provided, and that group of people - the chief executive of NHS Wales, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and Audit Wales - have given clear advice that Betsi Cadwaladr should move out of special measures, and that is the basis for my decision."" In a separate letter to Plaid Cymru, the auditor general said he wrote to the Welsh government at the time ""to indicate that it was unhelpful for the minister to imply that he had received direct advice from me or my staff on the escalation status of the health board"". Asked on the BBC's Politics Wales programme, if the ministers needed to correct the Senedd's record, Health Minister Eluned Morgan said: ""The first minister has clarified the position just to make sure everyone understands what is a complex process. ""The system means that the advice that is given by the civil service is undertaken partly as a result of the discussions that are undertaken by Health Inspectorate Wales and the auditor general. ""The auditor general, and I quote from their words, 'Audit Wales staff recognised that after five years of special measures the label itself was increasingly becoming a hindrance to improvement'. ""I think that what we need to do is just make sure we focus on the future. That's what I'm interested in. ""I'm not interested in semantics of two years ago. ""I want to see the improvements happening on the ground in Betsi for the future - that's what the public care about."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""They did mislead the Senedd. ""We're asking government for transparency, we're asking government to put their hands up and say, 'we got this one wrong'. ""Because at the heart of this is a struggling, is a troubling, a failed health board and we need to know why government took various decisions at various points in time to try to resolve the issues. ""They've failed and here we have government ducking responsibility, saying it's semantics. ""They might think it's semantics, the auditor general doesn't."" Welsh Conservative MS for Clwyd West Darren Millar told Politics Wales: ""We need to take ministers, frankly, out of the picture when it comes to intervening in our health services. ""We've got to get the politics out of this situation so that people can get the services that they deserve. ""We've got a health board in north Wales which is failing and has been failing now for a very long time."" ",934,uk,2023-04-23T14:44:31.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65365440
Therapy dog helps children with eating disorders ," A new therapy dog is helping young people who are being treated for eating disorders to be put at ease and laugh, his trainer said. Sipho, the 10-month-old labradoodle puppy, goes with his owner, Bronwyne Stott, a paediatric nurse, to The Brambles, in Duston, Northampton. Ms Stott, who works for the service run by Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHFT), said: ""He instinctively seems to know who is feeling anxious or vulnerable and will sit with his chin on their foot."" She said when he greets patients the entrance ""they immediately feel more relaxed"". The children and young people enjoy taking him for a walk around the garden, which makes them more open about how they are feeling, the trust said. ""He makes them laugh and gets them chatting. They can sit and stroke him which puts the children, and their parents, at ease,"" Ms Stott said. Staff also take him for a walk in their breaks to help with their own wellbeing. A parent, whose daughter has an eating disorder, said: ""It was a validating opportunity for her to have her views and opinions heard. ""Although she is often anxious in these kind of situations, she was put at ease and had a positive experience within the group."" It was hoped Sipho, the first dog to be used at the service, would be fully trained in another eight months. ""Dogs are therapeutic anyway, and the benefit of having Sipho here has been amazing,"" Ms Stott added. ""If you have an eating disorder, or complex feeding issue, he proves a great distraction from the challenging circumstances these children are in, and he helps give them the confidence to take the next steps towards recovery.""

Dozens of tractors in dementia charity run through Worcestershire," About 50 tractors paraded through Worcestershire on Saturday to raise money for a dementia charity. Organiser Andy Tippen, who also took part, said the grand total raised from the event was £715. ""I'm very pleased with it,"" he said. ""It was a super day."" The 48 tractors, led by a 1954 David Brown model, set off from the Three Counties Showground in Malvern and travelled for about 25 miles (40km) through the surrounding countryside. Mr Tippen, who has previously organised similar events to raise money for children's charities, chose to support Dementia UK after his father-in-law was diagnosed with the condition. ""We've all experienced dementia in some way, whether we know someone with it or we've had the condition so we all feel very strongly to support that particular charity,"" said John Clifford, who led the procession. He drove the David Brown model which he said his father ""bought new for me when I left school at 15 - I'm now in my 80s"". The route took in Upton-on-Stour, Longdon and Castlemorton, however farmers came from as far as Hereford to support the event. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Bristol coach to run London Marathon for Healthy Minds scheme," A tennis coach who used running to bounce back from depression is taking on a marathon to help others struggling with their mental health. University of Bristol coach Ravi Sharda said he felt extremely low at university and during the pandemic but ""didn't want to let anyone down"". He said he found it hard to open up but when he did he ""let go"" of shame. Mr Sharda will run the London Marathon to raise money for mental health sport scheme, Healthy Minds. The project is a University of Bristol physical exercise programme aimed at boosting student mental health. Mr Sharda said he knew he needed to make a change when he found himself crying on his bed in 2021. ""Growing up, mental health was never a topic spoken about much,"" he said. ""So when it came to times when I felt low at university and during the pandemic, I felt like something was seriously wrong with me, because I really didn't understand anything about depression. ""When I started talking about it I just finally felt like I wasn't holding this secret, this sense of shame."" He hopes to complete the London Marathon in under three hours while also raising money for a cause close to his heart. ""I really like Healthy Minds as it destigmatises physical activity. People might think 'my parents didn't do exercise, I've never done exercise' so it's not for me - but that's not the case,"" Mr Sharda said. ""Running has been really useful for me, but it's not necessarily for everyone. Sometimes it's just doing something that includes a goal, or being close to nature, or connecting with people. ""Something I've learnt is that it's completely normal to have low periods. A bad day isn't a bad life,"" he added. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Coventry childcare provider calls for more government help," With rising costs, some nursery owners claim government plans to help working parents will fail unless there's a big increase in funding for childcare providers. Free childcare for working parents is due to be extended to more age groups in the coming years. Katie George, owner of Georgie Porgie's Pre-school in Coventry, is worried she will be forced to shut. ""Let me do the job I love doing without thinking, can I meet my own costs?"". She explained her gas bill this time last year was £400 for the month. ""I had my March gas bill not long ago and it was £1,200,"" she said. ""It's not just that, the food has increased massively, water rates have increased massively, rent has increased. ""Staff salaries have increased, rightly so, but if the funding isn't increasing very much... it doesn't calculate,"" Ms George said. The changes will be phased in for households in England where the parent or parents earn at least £152 a week but less than £100,000 a year: April 2024: Eligible two-year-olds will get 15 hours of free childcare per week September 2024: Eligible children between nine months and two years will get 15 hours September 2025: Eligible children between nine months and three years will get 30 hours Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said: ""In the West Midlands, the hourly rate is much lower than the average that the government has announced. ""That means below £5, so they are expected to deliver high quality education and childcare under £5 an hour and that can't work"". Claire Richmond from Gosling's Day Nursery said from September, ""everybody here will need at least one privately funded day, that hopefully will protect our business to be able to continue to provide a proper service"". A spokesperson for the Department for Education said its announcement in the budget represents the ""single biggest investment in childcare in England ever"". It intends to uplift the rates for free childcare for 2-year olds to around £8 per hour and for three to four year olds to £5.50 per hour from September 2023, a total investment of £204m. Ms George added she did not want to pass rising costs on to the families who use her nursery but said government funding she receives doesn't covered the shortfall. ""I'm not asking to be a millionaire, I'm not asking to be a really profitable business, I'm asking to staff the nursery adequately with fantastic staff, pay them really well, and let me do the job that I love doing without thinking 'can I meet my own cost at home?',"" Ms George said.

Monmouthshire: Drugs gangs target children of teachers and GPs," Gangs are targeting the children of teachers, nurses and GPs to run drugs into rural areas, a council has been told. Children turn to crime due to a lack of job opportunities, a charity told Monmouthshire councillors. Dealers set up county lines supply routes to try to recruit ""clean skins"" - teenagers with no criminal record - the charity also said. They can be recruited via social media, it added. ""We work with many families where the parents are professionals, teachers, nurses and GPs,"" said Rebecca Miller, a team leader for the St Giles Trust Cymru. The cost of living, children struggling to return to school following the Covid pandemic and a lack of employment opportunities all contributed to young people falling into crime, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Danielle John, a case worker for the charity which works across south east Wales, Gloucestershire and and Bristol, told councillors young people who previously had not come to the attention of authorities were more attractive to drugs gangs. ""They know they don't have social workers so it can be easier to move them,"" Ms John said. Ms John said teenagers can be recruited via social media. ""Social media, TV shows and music can glamorise the lifestyle and it may be there parents are working so they do not have someone watching over them,"" she said. ""They may like a picture on social media and these people will message them and say, 'You liked this picture, do you want to be involved and make some money?'""

Exams system needs 'radical' overhaul - Gilruth," Scotland's qualification system needs a ""radical"" overhaul that better supports teachers and young people, the education secretary has said. Jenny Gilruth was speaking as pupils across the country sat down for the first written exams of the 2023 diet. This is the last year any modifications will be made to mitigate disruption caused by Covid. Next year the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) plans to set exams back to pre-pandemic norms. Last month an interim report, commissioned by the Scottish government to examine the future of assessment in the nation's schools, said the current exam system was no longer fit for purpose. A final version of the review, by Prof Louise Hayward, is set to be published next month. Ms Gilruth told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I think it is really important that what comes next, any incarnation in the future, must better support our teachers in our schools but it also must better support young people."" She also dismissed the suggestion that future reform would be anything more than a rebranding exercise. Ms Gilruth added: ""It needs to be radical. ""It needs to better support the profession and those in our schools."" Prof Hayward's report also proposed the introduction of a Scottish diploma of achievement - a qualification or graduation certificate that would provide evidence of pupils' achievements. Ms Gilruth said there was a need to ""future-proof our qualifications"" and told the programme they may look ""radically different"" in the future. She also said it was essential that pupils were assessed continuously throughout the academic year. Meanwhile, Ms Gilruth denied the decision to pull out of international education league tables, which First Minister Humza Yousaf reversed last week, was designed to hide sliding performance. The former teacher also said a ""relentless focus"" should be trained on closing the poverty-related attainment gap by 2026. But Ms Gilruth added: ""I am also mindful that schools have been dealing with, as I have alluded to, the impacts of Covid and the impacts of the cost of living crisis. ""That has been really challenging in our classrooms and we need to be really mindful of that in government too."" Parent groups said disruption from teacher strikes mean some young people are still feeling the pressure of catching up. They, and unions, said extra support would still be needed for pupils who have only known disruption at high school. S4 pupil Reagan is 16 and preparing to sit six National 5 exams. She hopes to study law at the University of Glasgow. Living in Glasgow, her school was targeted for multiple strike days because it was in a prominent MSP's constituency. She said: ""The pandemic happened when I was in S1. It didn't affect me too much. But with the strikes it was quite hard on me and my friends. ""During our prelims, the teachers were on strike the day before so we couldn't really talk to them or go over anything we were worried about."" Her mum, Lucia told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme it was a concerning time: ""I was very worried and we didn't know if it would affect her. ""When we knew the strikes were coming we tried to get her prepared from the teachers in advance."" Amy, 16, from Aberdeen, is also in S4 but felt the strikes did not affect her too much. She told BBC Scotland: ""I am a bit stressed but I worked hard over the Easter holidays so I feel prepared."" On the strikes, she said ""I was stressed that I wouldn't be in school but I wrote questions down and then brought them in to school."" Patrick McGlinchey from parental engagement charity Connect, thinks support is still vital for the Covid generation. ""What we need now is a period of stability and balance - that is what parents are telling us - and that means additional support for young people through this period from national government and those national bodies."" Scotland is currently in the middle of a massive rethink of its education system. Last year's OECD independent review led to the announcement that the SQA was to be replaced as part of an overhaul of education. The report backed the curriculum as a whole but said there was too much focus on exams in later years of schooling. Unions said they were wary of plunging young people into the ""business-as-usual"" SQA diet next year only to change the system again post-Hayward review. The SSTA have threatened to boycott exams in 2024 if they go ahead in this form. Scotland's largest teaching union believes Covid modifications should remain and added supports the idea of less exams. Andrea Bradley, general secretary of the EIS, said: ""We should not be putting young people unnecessarily through exams on an annual basis. ""It does not leave the necessary time and space for depth and enjoyment of learning. It places too much stress on too many young people and really exacerbates workload issues for teachers.

Merthyr Tydfil: Plans for more housing for homeless as demand surges," A plan to increase the amount of supported housing for the homeless in Merthyr Tydfil has been agreed. The council also plans to increase the number of HMOs (House in Multiple Occupation) as it seeks to reduce its temporary accommodation costs. A council report said Merthyr Tydfil had become over-reliant on the use of bed and breakfast (B&B) accommodation. Councils must provide temporary accommodation for homeless people until permanent accommodation can be found. The report, cited by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, said that the use of B&Bs for the length of time required by the council was unlawful but added that Welsh government recognised the need to use them while councils tried to solve high levels of homelessness. ""We must develop more supported accommodations looking at conversions of existing buildings in the short term and including provisions on areas of land or new development sites for the medium and longer term,"" the council report said. The report said that the demand for temporary accommodation was at ""unprecedented"" levels in Merthyr Tydfil. Single bedroom homes and additional supported accommodation were particularly required to meet the need in the town. If the council continues to rely on temporary accommodation to house people who are homeless, the cost is forecast to be £2.9m for 2022/2023, or around £2.4m after a Welsh Government grant. The Welsh Government grant award for the council for 2023/2024 towards temporary accommodation costs is £474,986, £1.38m less than the grant offered in the previous year when a grant claim for £1.85m was approved to secure B&B accommodation.

Northern Ireland strikes: Unions reject 'derisory' pay offer for lecturers," Unions representing further education (FE) lecturers in Northern Ireland have rejected what they called a derisory pay offer. The UCU and NASUWT said their members had been offered 1% for 2021-22 and 1% for 2022-23. They said that an additional offer of a one-off payment to staff was not the same as an annual pay deal. The Department for the Economy (DfE) has been contacted by BBC News NI for comment. The UCU claimed that ""the position lecturer staff find themselves in is a direct consequence of having no government"". The unions also claimed that a previous offer of 2% for 2021-22 had been blocked by the department. The NASUWT also said the further education college employers were ""in cloud cuckoo land"" if they thought lecturers would accept the offer. Lecturers in FE belonging to the NASUWT are due to take part in a widespread education strike on Wednesday. There are six further education colleges in Northern Ireland with over 50,000 students studying hundreds of courses. The UCU and NASUWT represent the vast majority of FE lecturing staff. The starting salary for a full-time FE lecturer in Northern Ireland is about £24,000 a year, although some staff work part-time or are paid on an hourly basis. But, as with teachers, there has been recent stalemate over a pay deal for FE lecturers in Northern Ireland. The unions negotiate pay with the six FE college chief executives - the employers - but any pay deal then has to be approved by Department for the Economy. In a letter to the FE employers seen by BBC News NI, the UCU's Northern Ireland official Katharine Clarke said the latest pay offer was ""derisory and must be rejected"". In a separate message to UCU members, Ms Clarke gave more details of the offer. She claimed that a previous offer of a 2% increase for 2021/22 made by the employers had been blocked by the department. She continued that the employers had subsequently offered lecturers a rise of 1% for 2021/22 and another 1% for 2022/23. However, the employers had also offered a one-off ""non-consolidated"" payment of £4,900 to each lecturer on a pro-rata basis. Ms Clarke said that the employers did not need agreement from the unions to give ""one-off"" payments to staff, but they were separate from annual pay. ""The accepted understanding of a pay award is a permanent percentage increase on baseline salary that is consolidated and pensionable,"" Ms Clarke said. ""We advised the employers that if they wish to proceed making a non-consolidated payment to staff, that is a matter for them. ""The position lecturer staff find themselves in is a direct consequence of having no government. ""In the absence of political authority and oversight, permanent secretaries are emboldened to make funding decisions that otherwise would be the preserve of elected ministers."" Ms Clarke said UCU members would now escalate action short of strike by refusing to formally provide colleges with marks for student work. ""Assessment and feedback to students will continue but marks will not be entered onto college systems or provided to awarding bodies,"" she said. The NASUWT's Justin McCamphill also told BBC News NI that the latest pay offer was ""derisory"". ""Lecturers were offered 2% for 2021-22 and have now been told that this is unaffordable,"" he said. ""The employers are in cloud cuckoo land if they think lecturers are prepared to accept a lower offer. ""Lecturer pay is now a long way behind schoolteacher pay. ""Our members have had enough and the strike action called for this Wednesday will go ahead as planned."" The department has previously told colleges and universities they could face funding cuts of almost 20% in 2023/24. On Sunday, the former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Sir David Sterling, warned that the level of cuts that may be required by Stormont departments in the forthcoming budget are ""undeliverable"".

Fifth of international students in Scotland face homelessness - report," More than a fifth of international students in Scotland have experienced homelessness during their studies, a survey has found. The National Union of Students (NUS) Scotland report stated international students are almost twice as likely to be homeless than home students. The organisation has called for a student housing guarantee. The Scottish government said it is working to improve accessibility in the student accommodation sector. Universities Scotland said that overall, students had been squeezed out of the private rented sector. In October the BBC heard from students who had begged letting agents to accept their bids on flats amid a major accommodation crisis. Some students used hostels and slept on common room floors, while others faced long commutes. A Universities Scotland spokesperson said: ""It is not acceptable for any student to be without secure and appropriate housing. ""Universities' relationship with their international students starts many months before they arrive in country, and we'd strongly encourage students to get in touch with their institution to see what advice, support and guidance is available when it comes to accommodation. ""Many institutions do offer a guarantor scheme for their students to address some of the issues highlighted in the NUS report."" The NUS data, compiled from 1,281 international students, found that about one in five (21%) experienced homelessness after starting their studies, compared to 12% of home students. The survey highlighted that international students struggle more than home students to obtain housing, as many do not have a UK-based guarantor, which is required by most landlords to secure a tenancy. The study also found that 42% of international students have gone without heating, 49% had skipped a meal and 10% had used foodbanks. The NUS is calling for universities to ensure that international students always have access to housing by introducing a student housing guarantee. It also urged universities to widen criteria for their hardship funds as international students are often excluded. NUS Scotland president, Ellie Gomersall, said the rates of homelessness among international students were unacceptable. She called for ministers to use devolved powers to cap fees for international students. ""Scotland prides itself on having a world-class education system, but this is being undermined by the way we treat those coming to learn from other countries,"" the union president said. ""International students are expected to pay extortionate fees but have no support once they arrive in Scotland, facing homelessness and skipping meals just to get by."" Vanessa Mabonso Nzolo, president of Aberdeen University Students' Association and a recently graduated international-EU student, said there is a misconception that international students are wealthy. ""The cost-of-living crisis is affecting international students disproportionately in the current economy as visa fees, exchange rates, and budgeting has become increasingly more difficult,"" she said. ""International students are less likely to come forward when they are struggling because they are worried about how being homeless may affect their visa. ""They have very few opportunities with limited working hours and no access to public funds."" Higher Education Minister Graeme Dey said the report raised significant issues which universities would take seriously. He said: ""Although the Scottish government has no direct role in provision of student residential accommodation, we are determined to improve accessibility, affordability and standards in the purpose built student accommodation sector and are carrying out a review of that provision right now. ""At the same time, we are developing proposals for improving privately-rented accommodation more generally which we set out in our draft new deal for tenants. ""Both pieces of work will inform a Student Accommodation Strategy for Scotland for the benefit of all students studying in Scotland.""

Coronation: How popular is the monarchy under King Charles?," The monarchy is at a time of transition. The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II had significant family turmoil, but was largely a period of stability and continuity for the monarchy. There is now a new king. But is public opinion about the monarchy changing too? Recent visits by King Charles have seen anti-monarchy protesters making their presence noisily felt, alongside those showing support for the new reign. Those anti-monarchists have acknowledged that they would have been reluctant to carry out such protests when the late queen was alive, because of the risk of antagonising the public. But now it seems the gloves are off. To gauge the public mood ahead of the coronation, Panorama commissioned a new YouGov opinion poll. The results suggest broad support for keeping the monarchy, with 58% preferring it to an elected head of state - which was supported by 26%. But, below these headline figures the poll points to attitude shifts under way - with some clear popularity challenges for the new king at the start of his reign. In particular, the monarchy seems to have a problem appealing to young people. While over-65s were the most likely to be supportive of the monarchy at 78%, 18-24 year olds were the least likely. Only 32% backed the monarchy. This younger group was more likely, at 38%, to prefer an elected head of state, although the remaining 30% didn't know. Indifference could be an issue as much as opposition, with 78% of the younger age group saying they were ""not interested"" in the Royal Family. So what are the difficult issues facing the new reign? The wealth of the Royal Family, at a time of cost-of-living pressures, is one factor that seems to sharply divide the age groups. As a headline figure, 54% of people in this online survey of 4,592 UK adults say the monarchy represents good value - compared with 32% who think it represents bad value. But the younger group polled - those aged 18-24 - were more likely, at 40%, to think the monarchy is bad value for money, while 36% thought the opposite. ""The number of palaces is absurd. Frankly, you need one palace for state occasions, Buckingham Palace, and perhaps one other for when they want to retire to the country,"" says former Lib Dem minister and critic of royal funding, Norman Baker. He also highlights what he claims is an overuse of helicopters and private jets when the King is ""lecturing people about climate change"". Such accusations are rejected by Lord Nicholas Soames, a friend of the King's for many years, who says using a helicopter would only be for a ""very good purpose"" on public duties. ""This is not done as a sort of jaunt,"" he says. Constitutional expert Sir Vernon Bogdanor also doesn't accept the financial criticism. ""I think the Royal Family give, on the whole, very good value for money. And the only people who receive money are those who undertake public duties."" But there are public sensitivities about spending, as highlighted in another YouGov poll last week, which found a majority of people did not believe that the government should pay for the coronation. How much the coronation will cost, in terms of public spending, won't be revealed by the government until after the event. Will King Charles Change the Monarchy? With an exclusive opinion poll ahead of the coronation, Panorama asks if the new King will adapt the monarchy to suit modern times. Watch - Will King Charles Change the Monarchy? on BBC One at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales) on Monday 24 April and also on iPlayer (UK only) There have also been recent newspaper investigations into royal funding which have questioned the boundaries of private and public funding for the royals - including the status of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, estates which each generate more than £20m in profits for the royals. According to Mr Baker, these holdings of land and property should be seen as ""public assets"" and ""the money that they raise in terms of profit should go to the taxpayer to fund public services"", instead of being ""diverted into royal coffers"". In response Buckingham Palace says the Duchy of Cornwall funds the public, private and charitable activities of the heir to the throne - while the Duchy of Lancaster helps fund the sovereign so they are not otherwise a ""burden on the state"". Prof Anna Whitelock, a historian at City University who explores the place of the monarchy in modern Britain, questions why a new monarch does not have to pay inheritance tax on the death of a previous sovereign. But the Palace points out that decisions about funding and taxation are decided by the government, not by the Royal Family themselves. Nonetheless, questions over the opacity of royal finances seem likely to continue and the scale of uncertainty is suggested by the size of the different conclusions from two separate recent newspaper investigations into the King's wealth - one saying he was worth £600m and another £1.8bn. Questions over money might feed into doubts about how well the royals can empathise with the experiences of the public. The polling of UK adults for Panorama - carried out between 14 and 17 April - suggests more people believe the King is ""out of touch"" by 45% to 36%. But the King has had decades of working through his charities to support disadvantaged families - and Dame Martina Milburn, former chief executive of the Prince's Trust, praised his ability to communicate with a wide range of people. ""I've literally been with him in prisons, in youth offending institutes, in job centres - and he can make that connection, it is quite extraordinary,"" she says. Although Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, suggests polling reflects an often under-reported level of opposition to the monarchy. ""Across the country there are millions of people who want the monarchy abolished,"" he says. Another intense area of sensitivity for the Royal Family has been perceptions of their attitudes towards race. From the fallout with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to the high-profile row over the treatment of black charity founder Ngozi Fulani at a Buckingham Palace reception - it has been a thorny subject. The scale of the challenge is suggested in the YouGov polling which found people from ethnic minority backgrounds were less likely to support the monarchy. Of that group, 40% wanted an elected head of state rather than a monarchy. Similarly, people from ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to think the royals have a ""problem with race and diversity"", with 49% saying they thought the royals did have a problem - while the overall percentage, regardless of background, was 32%. Lord Soames strongly rejects any suggestions of racism. ""There's not a racist drop of blood in the King,"" he says. Buckingham Palace says the King and the Royal Household treat all matters of race and diversity with great seriousness - pointing to the ""swift and robust"" response to the Ngozi Fulani row as evidence. It says it has also carried out a review of its diversity and inclusion policies. But this is also an issue affecting relations outside the UK, including the Commonwealth, where questions are being raised about the legacy of colonialism and slavery. In a speech to Commonwealth leaders in Rwanda last year, the then Prince Charles spoke of the ""depths of his personal sorrow"" at the suffering caused by the slave trade. In another speech - during last autumn's visit of the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa - the King said: ""We must acknowledge the wrongs which have shaped our past if we are to unlock the power of our common future."" But Sir Hilary Beckles - a historian in Barbados and chairman of the Caricom Reparations Commission - says more action is needed because, at present, the relationship between the monarchy and the Caribbean is ""tense"". ""That tension can easily be alleviated by the King pursuing a reparatory justice path that begins with language of apology, and then evolves into practical, everyday activity that will help to promote Caribbean economic development,"" he says. Buckingham Palace says Historic Royal Palaces - a charity which looks after six sites including the Tower of London and Kensington Palace - is a partner in an independent research project exploring the links between the British monarchy and the slave trade. King Charles takes the issue profoundly seriously, it says. The polling for Panorama might raise questions about a moment of change for the monarchy. But it's also something of a picture of continuity. The overall findings show broad support for the monarchy, alongside a sizeable minority of sceptics. Many polls over the years have found something similar, with rises and falls alongside the changing headlines. The popularity of the royals seemed to reach a high point around 2011-2012, the era of Prince William and Kate's wedding and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. There has been a downward drift in the following years and the rows surrounding Prince Harry's book, Spare, earlier this year saw the approval ratings for the royals take a hit - but that doesn't necessarily mean they won't recover. It will also depend on how much young people maintain their current trend of a rising lack of enthusiasm for the monarchy. The long-running British Social Attitudes survey has previously found that people's views tend to become more sympathetic to the monarchy as they get older. The new reign will be watching carefully and hoping that pattern continues. The figures in the YouGov poll for Panorama have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults. The same sample includes a boost of respondents from an ethnic minority background. ",1622,uk,2023-04-23T23:00:13.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65326467
Head's sister hits out at Ofsted boss for defending inspection," The sister of a head teacher who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection has criticised the watchdog's boss for defending it. Amanda Spielman told the BBC she had no reason to doubt the report into Caversham Primary in Reading. Head teacher Ruth Perry died in January, knowing inspectors would downgrade the school's rating. Her sister, Prof Julia Waters, said Ms Spielman's response was ""totally inadequate"". She added that there had been a ""glaring contrast"" between what Ofsted had said about the school, compared with an earlier visit in 2019 to test a new framework for inspections in England. In a statement to the BBC, she added that Ofsted's system was ""not fit for purpose"" with urgent reforms needed to ""prevent another tragedy occurring"". In her first interview since Ms Perry's death, Ms Spielman told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme she believed the findings of the inspection, which took place last year, were ""secure"". She added that the inspection team ""worked with the professionalism and sensitivity that I would expect"". Asked if she had any concerns about what happened, she replied: ""From what I've seen I don't have any reason to doubt the inspection."" Ms Perry knew the inspection would rate her primary school as inadequate, the lowest grade possible. Her family believe the anxiety and stress following the inspection led to her suicide. Asked if she had spoken to the family, Ms Spielman said Ofsted had not received an approach and had not wanted to ""intrude on their grief"" but she would be ""open"" to a meeting. Ms Spielman observed a pilot inspection of Caversham Primary in 2019, which took place after Ms Perry volunteered the school to help test a new inspection framework. In newsletters to parents afterwards, the head teacher described the informal feedback they received as ""glowing"". In her statement, Prof Waters said there was ""glaring contrast"" between this and the subsequent inspection last year. She said the Ofsted chief had made ""no reference"" in her interview to having met her sister in 2019. She said that aspects of Ofsted's system, including single-word judgements and the length of time between inspections and the final report, had ""contributed to my sister's decline and despair"". ""We do not want warm words, thoughts or sympathies. We want urgent action now,"" she added. In her interview, Ms Spielman acknowledged there was a ""culture of fear"" within schools over Ofsted inspections. But she said this was the result of several factors, including people thinking about the consequences of inspections - particularly ""inadequate"" judgements - which she pointed out make up a ""tiny proportion"". For the vast majority of schools, she added, the inspection process is a ""positive and affirming experience"". Her comments are unlikely to soothe the anger of teachers, however, who since Ms Perry's death have been, day after day, expressing their fears and experiences of inspections that have been difficult. Caversham Primary School was downgraded by Ofsted after inspectors decided that checks on staff and record-keeping of concerns about children were inadequate. Under the current system, this meant the leadership of the school is declared inadequate, as well as the school overall. The quality of education and behaviour at the school were praised by inspectors. Ms Spielman defended the ""clarity and simplicity"" of the current inspection system, adding: ""It's not for us to say we're going to fundamentally change the grading system, that would have to be a bigger government decision."" In a previous statement, she outlined some changes Ofsted is making, but said the single overall grade ""currently plays an integral part in the wider school system"". These include looking at how inspectors can return quicker to schools which have work to do on safeguarding but are otherwise performing well, in order to reflect improvements in their judgements. Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said the way safeguarding issues affect a school's overall rating should be looked at. Asked if he believed it can sometimes be ""over the top"", he replied: ""I think it's important that a proportionate approach is taken."" Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union said Ofsted inspections are not working at all and were a ""problem which has been growing over decades"". Appearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, she said: ""The problem is that Ofsted doesn't inspect schools fairly and that Ofsted doesn't know whether it raises qualities in schools at all... ""The problem that teachers and leaders have is that they've got no idea which inspection team will turn up at their school, one which will do a decent inspection or one which will be aggressive and demeaning."" Most of the outstanding schools in England inspected in 2021 were downgraded, according to Ofsted, when routine inspections resumed after nearly a decade. Under a policy introduced under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2012, outstanding schools were only inspected where specific concerns had been raised. The previous policy meant some schools went almost 15 years without an inspection, something Ms Spielman said had been a ""mistake"".

Cost of living: 'I worry about money more than my uni assignments'," University students say they are continuing to face soaring costs, with nearly half of undergraduate students saying they have skipped their studies to undertake paid work. BBC News spoke to two students who say the cost-of-living crisis is taking its toll on their studies. ""This year's been my hardest year."" Zineb Bouita, 21, is a second year journalism student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU). She says the rising costs of food and travel have impacted her so much, she is seeking to complete her studies away from the city. She says she receives around £7,000, per academic year, from her maintenance loan. But with £750 going on her rent each month and monthly food costs of around £150, she says paying her bills has become too stressful - particularly since she was made redundant from her job working for a family firm. ""University should be my future, but with money worries, I just can't pay attention to it,"" she said. ""Without a job, it's just too much. ""I've reached out to my university, asking for a referral back to my hometown of Manchester to complete my final year. ""It's devastating. I've made a life and friends here in Nottingham."" The Cost of Learning Trying to stay warm, juggling part-time jobs and the impact on their mental health. BBC News follows the lives of three university students in Leeds to find out how they are tackling the cost of living crisis. Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only). In 2022 Zineb's living costs became so high she felt she had to prioritise paid work over her university studies. She is now having to re-take the year. ""Mentally, it is so draining,"" she said. ""You have to wake up, go to work, go to university, meet your assignment deadlines, consider how you will afford to pay your rent each month. ""I had this image that I'd just be a student. Going to my lectures, going to social events - I've just not been able to experience that at all."" Instead, she said, she is spending more time in bed to save on her heating bills and is choosing an early night over her evening meal. ""University isn't even in my frame of thoughts any more; I'll just get to it when I can get to it,"" she said. ""It's just pushed to the side. Money is always a stress for me."" Liana Homjakova, 22, says she is also feeling the pinch. Originally from Latvia, she's working as a chef in Nottingham while studying full-time. She fears the extra shifts are impacting her grades. ""I worry about money more than I worry about my university assignments,"" she said. ""I feel these constant money worries have impacted my potential to achieve academically. ""It is more important to focus on money because without it I just can't survive."" Liana, who is also studying journalism at NTU and is in her final year, said she fears students have been forgotten throughout the cost-of-living crisis. ""It's such a misconception that we're not struggling,"" she said. ""We just don't get attention or we get negative attention that we're just complaining over nothing."" NTU said it urged students who were struggling to approach their university for help and advice without fear of judgement. Michael Lees, director of campus services at NTU, said: ""We've given away a £100 cost of living bursary to 9,000 students already, and we've got the hardship fund with about £1.5 million there so we urge students to come and take advantage of that if they are in such a position that they need it."" Save the Student, a money-saving website, is urging the government to reconsider the 2.8% increase in maintenance loans this autumn, claiming that if the rise is not contested, students may lose out on £1,500. Save the Student's Tom Allingham said he believed the cost-of-living crisis was one of the most challenging situations students have faced in the 16 years of the website's existence. He said students were contemplating dropping out of university or turning to other means of earning money such as sex work to survive. He called on the government to take action to help students. A spokesperson from the Department for Education (DfE) said: ""We recognise students continue to face financial challenges which is why we are increasing loans and grants for living and other costs for a further year. ""To help students who need further support we have made an additional £15m available, increasing our student premium funding to £276m this academic year. ""We urge students who are worried about their circumstances to speak to their university."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

The children braving a risky border crossing to attend school," Every morning, 13-year-old Marcelo Jesus Gouriyú and his nine-year-old brother leave their home in the small Venezuelan town of Calié at half past four in the morning to go to school in Colombia. The two children walk unaccompanied through the dark for around two hours to make it in time for the start of their lessons at half past six. As the sun rises, they slip into Colombia through informal border crossings known as trochas to reach their school in the town of Paraguachón. The trochas in this region on Colombia's northern tip are dangerous rural dirt tracks that weave across the arid border and are controlled by local armed groups, which often charge users a fee to pass through. In what may well be a sign of teenage bravado, Marcelo denies being scared of journeying through these informal crossings day in day out. ""I like coming to school in Colombia,"" he says, adding that ""they don't really have lessons there [where I live]"". Venezuela's crumbling economy and ongoing socio-political crisis has pushed many institutions to the brink. Read more about Venezuela's crisis: Rural schools lie neglected and barely functioning, offering lessons only a few days a week and facing a dire shortage of teachers, forcing Venezuelan children like Marcelo to risk the dangerous border crossing. At the Centro Educativo Indígena Número 6, the school Marcelo attends in Paraguachón, roughly 40% of the 1,270 students are Venezuelans who cross into neighbouring Colombia to access better schooling. More than one-third of these Venezuelan children use trochas to make the crossing. And not all of them share Marcelo's bravado. One of his classmates admits they are ""dangerous"". ""Sometimes I come to school and sometimes I don't,"" the boy, who is also 13, says. And he is right to worry. According to Bram Ebus, a consultant for the International Crisis Group, violent clashes to control these trochas are not uncommon. ""In addition to extorting fees, criminal groups also use these trochas to transport drugs and illegal gold, or to charge smugglers for using their border crossings,"" Mr Ebus explains. Parents are only too aware of the risks, but sending their children to school via the dangerous trochas is usually the only way for many families living along Venezuela's border with Colombia to guarantee their children education. Those who can, accompany their children, but many parents have to stay behind to work in order to make ends meet in Venezuela's precarious economy. It is a dilemma the mother of Marcelo's classmate faces and sometimes she prefers to keep him at home. ""These days I hardly come [to school] because my mother doesn't want to send me through the trochas by myself,"" the boy says. Following a recent thaw in diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Colombia the trochas are no longer the only way to get across the border. In January, the border reopened fully for the first time in seven years but, for many locals, the formalisation of diplomatic relations between Colombia and Venezuela has so far failed to make much of an impact on their daily struggles. The informal trochas are often a more convenient alternative to taking long detours to the official border crossings, Mr Ebus explains. Furthermore, many Venezuelans lack the necessary papers to cross at the official points. ""Obtaining valid proof of identity has become increasingly challenging for many Venezuelans due to bureaucratic barriers, legal ambiguity and high costs,"" Mr Ebus says. Around 200 of the students at Marcelo's school still use the informal trochas to get to class, school officials estimate. ""Those who come through the trochas, like our students, have no other choice,"" the school's headmistress, Georgina Deluquez, explains. Mr Ebus says the Colombian and Venezuelan governments raised unrealistic hopes for a sudden improvement in the security situation along the border. ""Border communities have historically been abandoned by the state. While opening the border is a necessary step, both governments should also address the historical situation of underdevelopment in remote border areas,"" he argues. Headmistress Georgina Deluquez says the influx of Venezuelan students has been a challenge for her school. ""Everything that happens in Venezuela has repercussions for us [in Colombia]. As long as Venezuela continues in crisis, children will continue to arrive and we do not have the capacity to care for them,"" she says. This month alone, the school has received 11 new students - the majority of whom are Venezuelans. But it is a challenge Ms Deluquez is determined to meet: ""How could we leave them? How could I say no, if it is the only educational centre on the border? If we do not take them in, then what is left for the children?""

Laura Kuenssberg: What is really going on in our schools?," You pack the kids off in the morning hoping not just that they have remembered their PE kit, but they'll spend a happy day in a safe place where they will learn something useful. An excellent education can completely change a child's life. A poor one can be a waste of opportunity or worse. For the first time in a while there's the beginnings of vigorous political debate about what is going on in our classrooms, and according to many different sources I've talked to in the last few days, it isn't pretty. One senior school leader told me ""everyone is cross about everything, all of the time"". Another senior figure said ""they'd never seen the sector so miserable"". But what is really going on? The death of a much loved teacher, Ruth Perry, has shone a light on England's education watchdog Ofsted. Her family blames it for what happened to Ruth - who took her own life - after the primary school in Caversham, Berkshire, she loved and led was to be downgraded from ""outstanding"" to ""inadequate"". Ofsted has said its thoughts are with Ms Perry's family and has described her death as a tragedy, while the Department for Education offered its ""deep condolences"" and was providing support to the school. But as our education editor Branwen Jeffreys has written here, the tragedy of a single family has led to an outpouring of concern about Ofsted. There are countless stories of stress and anxiety for teachers prompted by the inspection regime. But faith in the education system also matters to parents, the wider public, politicians and most importantly children themselves. On this Sunday's show we'll hear for the first time since Ruth Perry's death from Amanda Spielman, the Chief Inspector of Schools for England - and there's a lot to talk about. Thirty years after it was set up by the Conservatives in 1992, Ofsted still prompts a combination of fear and mockery from teachers. In those early years it didn't exactly get off on the right foot with the profession. Chris Woodhead, the second and notoriously outspoken Ofsted boss, even said there were 15,000 incompetent teachers who should get the sack. Maybe it's not surprising that education often finds fault with the inspector that judges it. After all, no-one wants to be best friends with the referee. Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, inspects and reports on anywhere that provides education for young people in England - including schools, nurseries and childminders. Schools or organisations are inspected every four years or 30 months depending on their status, and are then graded accordingly: Many parents rely on Ofsted ratings to help them choose a school or nursery for their child. Why are outstanding schools being downgraded? Schools in England have a lot of freedom to make their own decisions compared with many other countries, so Ofsted's backers say it is absolutely vital they are judged and measured robustly. Of course, parents want to know what's going on and need information they can trust. But politicians are all too aware of the souring mood. There's no question of the government scrapping the organisation - nor would Labour now, despite a previous plan to do so. But there is a growing conversation about aspects of the system and whether there does need to be a moment of change. Right now, Ofsted and ministers are reluctant to let go of the one-phrase grades which follow an inspection, saying it is useful for parents to have clear and simple labels. But it's one of the features of the judgements that is most hated by parts of the sector. One experienced school governor told me: ""Where else would a two-day visit result in one word that judges a lifetime's work?"" Labour would replace the system with a more nuanced ""scorecard"" - although on its own that would be unlikely to ease all the concerns. One former education minister questions whether the organisation is really fit for the 2020s as ""it was invented before Google"" and has barely changed for 30 years. But a serving minister suggests part of the current anxiety stems from the fact that many schools are being inspected for the first time in more than a decade. Under a plan introduced by the then-Education Secretary Michael Gove in 2011, outstanding schools were exempted from inspection indefinitely - and would only be visited by Ofsted if there were specific concerns. Add pandemic delays to that and some schools, like Ruth Perry's, have gone at least 10 years without an inspection. The former minister brands that policy ""nuts"". The pandemic, of course, means that for much of the last few years children had to learn in their living rooms or on their parents' mobile phones. The former education minister questions the fairness of Ofsted's current inspections because ""they are inspecting the home learning environment as much as they are inspecting the schools itself"". Unions have, maybe not surprisingly, suggested Ofsted is judging a school's intake as much as they are inspecting what happens on site. Around the UK the inspection system varies because education is devolved to each country's national governments. Education Scotland inspects schools and nurseries. Estyn is responsible for learning provision in Wales and Northern Ireland has the Education and Training Inspectorate. Away from the pressures of Ofsted, why are school leaders expressing concerns about such a dire situation in schools? It's not because of some sudden crash in standards. GCSE and A-level results in 2022 were down slightly on the pandemic years, but still up on the achievements of 2019. England has improved its ratings in some international education league tables in recent times. But the after effects of the pandemic are profound. Statistics suggest that being out of school during the pandemic normalised missing class to a worrying extent. Before the pandemic around 13% of children missed more than 10% of their lessons. The latest figure says it is now 22% of pupils - so nearly a quarter of a class is missing at least a day of school every fortnight. Teachers report kids coming back after the pandemic being less able to interact with them and their classmates. One school leader says ""kids who used to be compliant have come back from Covid refusing to go into lessons, saying 'why should I?'."" Of course, each generation of teenagers finds ways of challenging authority. But a Department for Education report this month found nearly two-thirds of teachers said pupil behaviour is ""good"" or ""very good"". Many teachers though feel something has changed, with one saying they're left feeling ""beleaguered and unloved"". One minister acknowledges since Covid teachers ""have had a bashing and they feel it personally"". Cost of living pressures are having an affect as well. Teachers are taking strike action over pay and even one of the headteachers' unions, the ASCL, is balloting for walkouts for the very first time. Pressure on families' finances shows up in classrooms too. ""Our schools are poorer, and our pupils are poorer too,"" one teacher says. While schools are on track to receive a big lump of extra cash to take England's education budget to £58.8bn by 2025, spending per pupil actually fell in real terms by 8% between 2009-10 and 2018-19. There's been less cash, more challenges, and now, more concern. Compared with that other enormous public service, the NHS, the political conversation around schools has been relatively muted in the last few elections. It's the health service which has seen vast increases in budgets and its staff lavished with praise by politicians - notwithstanding the current hostile standoffs on pay. Around a million people have contact of some kind with the health service every day. But every morning more than nine million children, just in England, head off to school. With so many challenges for parents, pupils and teachers right now, perhaps education's prominence as a political issue might begin to grow.

Welsh schools to get guidance on supporting transgender pupils," National guidance for schools in Wales on how to support transgender pupils will be published during the next academic year. The Welsh government said it required ""extensive consultation"" and would provide ""clear and well-informed advice"". One charity said teachers often lacked confidence in talking about issues relating to gender. School of Hard Knocks said the topic came up ""more and more"" in schools. The charity uses sports like rugby to help at-risk children re-engage with school and avoid permanent exclusion, but found there was an appetite from teachers for help in how to support transgender, non-binary and gender-exploring young people. Sian Edwards said it ran focus groups to find out the key issues faced by teachers and pupils. ""More and more students are exploring their gender and being open with how they identify and using pronouns that differ to the ones they were given at birth,"" she said. ""That's something teachers are seeing more and more and it's not something that they're necessarily familiar with or comfortable with."" The Inc Project, led by School of Hard Knocks, now offers training to schools and other organisations. ""A key message from the training is - have the conversation. Students just want to know that you're trying to help - that is the biggest thing that will make a difference,"" added Dr Edwards. Alison Carney, a consultant who helps deliver the training, acknowledged it could be a sensitive area and teachers feared getting it wrong. ""We talked to the kids and the teachers about what are the problems they're having in school and this isn't about necessarily getting down to the [detail] of policy,"" she said. ""It's simply about what could make their day to day better."" The Welsh government committed to issuing guidance in summer 2023 as part of its LGBTQ+ Action Plan, but said it had been delayed to ensure a full consultation avoiding exam time and the school summer holidays. ""This is a complex area of policy which requires extensive consultation with experts, practitioners and the public, as well as children and young people themselves,"" the Welsh government said. It said the guidance was needed to help teachers make sure transgender children and young people ""feel safe and adequately supported in education"". Dan Hayes, 23, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said more guidance could have helped him while he was at school. ""It started when I was maybe eight or nine. It was mainly me thinking 'these aren't the clothes I'm meant to wear'. As I went through puberty... 'I shouldn't look like this',"" he said. ""I actually found the words to describe myself a lot later when I was 16 or 17. But even then it took a lot to identify with those words 'I am transgender'."" Dan said he found having to wear girls' uniform difficult. ""I always felt very uncomfortable going to school looking like that. I tried my best to fit in growing my hair long, wearing make-up but it just never worked,"" he said. Dan said being transgender or non-binary was rarely mentioned in school, apart from as ""a joke"" and he said more guidance for teachers might help. ""I didn't want to talk to any of my teachers about it because I didn't think they'd understand. ""I think it's important for trans kids to know there are people like them out there."" The Welsh Conservatives said it was a ""delicate subject"" and ""vital"" to get right. The party's education spokesperson, Laura Anne Jones, said: ""The guidance should allow teachers to focus on teaching and not pander to identity politics and culture wars."" Any guidance ""should not come at the expense of women and girls' rights"", she added. The Children's Commissioner for Wales, Rocio Cifuentes, said it was important that adults were ""well equipped and confident in giving advice and help"". ""I expect the Welsh government's upcoming national trans guidance for schools to act as a comprehensive and practical tool to help schools to confidently respond to pupils' needs,"" she added. The UK government has promised guidance for schools in England during the summer term after an education union said members were having to navigate ""a minefield"". Some parents have previously sought to challenge the approach taken by schools and local authorities. ",706,uk,2023-04-22T05:49:10.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65336915
NI Education: Pupil spending 'similar to England and Wales'," The amount spent on each school pupil's education in Northern Ireland is similar to England and Wales, a new analysis suggests. That is according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the UK's leading economic research institutes. The IFS said that about £7,200 was spent on each pupil in Northern Ireland, England and Wales in 2022-23. But it said there was ""uncertainty"" over future school funding in NI due to ""signals of budget cuts"". It also suggested that extra money for schemes set up during the Covid-19 pandemic was responsible for some of the increased spending in 2022-23. The Department of Education (DE) has recently stopped a number of those schemes to save money. That included so-called holiday hunger payments and counselling for primary school children. On Thursday, the department also told schools that the long-running Extended Schools Scheme, which provided extra support to disadvantaged pupils, would end in June. A previous report by the IFS in 2021 had suggested that Northern Ireland spent less on each school pupil's education than any other part of the UK. But in its latest analysis which compares school spending across the UK, the IFS said that Northern Ireland spent similar amounts to England and Wales per pupil in 2022-23. Spending in Scotland was the highest in the UK, with about £8,500 spent per pupil in 2022-23, about £1,300 more than in Northern Ireland, England or Wales. But in Northern Ireland, according to the IFS, spending per pupil ""grew by 11% in real terms between 2018-19 and 2022-23"" after falling for almost a decade. The IFS analysis suggests two main reasons why the money spent on each pupil's education in Northern Ireland has risen. The previous analysis by the IFS in 2021 was completed before extra funding for teacher pay rises in 2019 and 2020 was agreed. Teachers eventually received a 2% pay increase for 2019-20 and 2% again in 2020-21. However, there has since been stalemate over a pay deal for teachers, which has led to strike action by unions. In the two years of the pandemic from 2020 to 2022, the IFS also said that about £790 per pupil per year was spent in Northern Ireland in extra Covid-related funding for schools. That included funding for the ""holiday hunger"" scheme to provide free school meal payments during holidays and the Engage programme, both of which have now been cut. As a result the author of the IFS study, Luke Sibieta, said that although recent increases in school spending ""have just about reversed past cuts"" in Northern Ireland, ""there are strong signals of budget cuts"" for 2023-24. The IFS study was funded by the Nuffield Foundation. ",445,uk,2023-04-22T05:45:41.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65353072
Earth Day: How to talk to your parents about climate change," You want to go vegan to help the planet, but you're not paying for the shopping. You think trains are better than planes, but your dad books the summer holiday. Young people are some of the world's most powerful climate leaders and want rapid action to tackle the problem. It makes a lot of sense. Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents. Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips: Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, say scientists. Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision. ""I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,"" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook ""nice"" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. ""It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,"" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. ""It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,"" she explains. Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project. Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. ""Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term."" How we travel is a major source of carbon emissions, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more. Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. ""Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',"" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge. Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. ""Give them options for something fun or exciting."" ""Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,"" she suggests. She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. ""People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,"" she says. Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult. Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy. ""Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,"" she says. Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. ""Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,"" she suggests. ""Make connections with things they care about,"" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community. ""It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,"" she explains. Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. ""Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,"" Phoebe explains.

Monmouthshire: Pupils choose gender-neutral toilets at new school," A new super school will have gender-neutral toilets following a consultation with pupils. All pupils at King Henry VIII school in Abergavenny - which caters for children aged three to 19 - will still also have access to single-sex toilets. But those aged 12 and above will also have access to non-gendered facilities, Monmouthshire councillor Martyn Groucutt confirmed. Deri View Primary and King Henry Comprehensive pupils were consulted. Mr Groucutt, council member for education, said ""the non-binary voice was heard"" when students at the two existing school were asked what toilets they wanted in their new super school. Giving older pupils the option of a gender-neutral toilet would serve ""those who see themselves as neither [a boy nor a girl],"" the Labour councillor for Abergavenny added, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. He said all toilets will have ""floor to ceiling"" doors and there would be no urinals for boys in any of the school toilets. Mr Groucutt said the designated girls toilets and the ""non-gender specific toilets"" would both have bins for sanitary products. It means if governors or senior teachers wanted they could change the designation of any toilet ""week on week"". Louise Brown, Conservative councillor for Shirenewton, said she was ""tempted to say"" she would have preferred the ""simple answer of single-sex toilets for all schools"". But she said it was important schools have both single-sex toilets and ""unisex disabled toilets"". ",235,uk,2023-04-21T21:07:53.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65354124
"Climate change: recent, rapid ocean warming alarms scientists"," A recent, rapid heating of the world's oceans has alarmed scientists concerned that it will add to global warming. This month, the global sea surface hit a new record high temperature. It has never warmed this much, this quickly. Scientists don't fully understand why this has happened. But they worry that, combined with other weather events, the world's temperature could reach a concerning new level by the end of next year. Experts believe that a strong El Niño weather event - a weather system that heats the ocean - will also set in over the next months. Warmer oceans can kill off marine life, lead to more extreme weather and raise sea levels. They are also less efficient at absorbing planet-warming greenhouse gases. An important new study, published last week with little fanfare, highlights a worrying development. Over the past 15 years, the Earth's accumulated heat has increased by 50%, with most of the extra going into the oceans. This is having real world consequences - not only did the overall temperature of the oceans hit a new record in April this year, in some regions the difference from the long term was enormous. In March, sea surface temperatures off the east coast of North America were as much as 13.8C higher than the 1981-2011 average. ""It's not yet well established, why such a rapid change, and such a huge change is happening,"" said Karina Von Schuckmann, the lead author of the new study and an oceanographer at the research group Mercator Ocean International. ""We have doubled the heat in the climate system the last 15 years, I don't want to say this is climate change, or natural variability or a mixture of both, we don't know yet. But we do see this change."" One factor that could be influencing the level of heat going into the oceans is, interestingly, a reduction in pollution from shipping. In 2020, the International Maritime Organisation put in place a regulation to reduce the sulphur content of fuel burned by ships. This has had a rapid impact, reducing the amount of aerosol particles released into the atmosphere. But aerosols that dirty the air also help reflect heat back into space - removing them may have caused more heat to enter the waters. The average surface temperature of the world's seas has increased by around 0.9C compared to preindustrial levels, with 0.6C coming in the last 40 years alone. This is less than increases in air temperatures over the land - which have risen by more than 1.5C since preindustrial times. This is because much more energy is needed to heat water than land, and because oceans absorb heat far below their surface. Even this seemingly small average increase has significant real-world consequences. Another important factor that is worrying scientists is the weather phenomenon known as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. For the past three years this naturally occurring event has been in a cooler phase called La Niña, and has helped keep global temperatures in check. But researchers now believe that a strong El Niño is forming which will have significant implications for the world. ""The Australian Bureau's model does go strongly for a strong El Niño. And it has been trending that way and all the climate models have been trending that way to a stronger event,"" said Hugh McDowell from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. Mr McDowell cautioned that predictions at this point of the year are less reliable. Other researchers are more bullish. A coastal El Niño has already developed off the shores of Peru and Ecuador and experts believe a fully formed event will follow with implications for global temperatures. ""If a new El Niño new comes on top of it, we will probably have additional global warming of 0.2-0.25C,"" said Dr Josef Ludescher, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research. ""The impact on the temperature is relaxed a few months after the peak of any El Niño so this is why 2024 will be probably the warmest on record."" ""And we may, we will be close to 1.5C days and perhaps we will temporarily go over."" El Niño will likely disrupt weather patterns around the world, weaken the monsoon and threaten more wildfires in Australia. But there are more fundamental worries that as more heat goes into the ocean, the waters may be less able to store excess energy. And there are concerns that the heat contained in the oceans won't stay there. Several scientists contacted for this story were reluctant to go on the record about the implications. One spoke of being ""extremely worried and completely stressed."" Some research has shown that world is warming in jumps, where little changes over a period of years and then there are sudden leaps upwards, like steps on a stairs, closely linked to the development of El Niño. There is some hope in this scenario, according to Karina Von Schuckmann. Temperatures may come down again after the El Niño subsides. ""We still have a window where we can act and we should use this to reduce the consequences,"" she told BBC News. Graphics by Erwan Rivault.

How 'rewiggling' Swindale Beck brought its fish back," ""Nature needs chaos, it needs randomness,"" says Lee Schofield from the RSPB. He is sitting on the bank of Swindale Beck, a stretch of river the flows into Haweswater Reservoir in Cumbria - one of England's largest lakes. The chaos - and the nature - has returned to this site after being missing for two centuries. This is because, about 200 years ago, the community of Swindale embarked on an ambitious project to straighten this section of the beck, with the aim of speeding the flow of water through the valley and increasing the amount of farmland surrounding it. That had unintended consequences. The faster-flowing water was too swift for fish like salmon and trout to spawn. And the river carried more sediment downstream, making it murkier. So back in 2016, the RSPB and its partners -  including the water company that owns the land - embarked on a remeandering or ""rewiggling"" project. /include/vjeastasia/800-flourish_on_slack/english/NEWSSPEC-36901?responsive=true&newsapps=true&app-image=https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/vjassets/img/app-launcher.png&app-clickable=true&amp-clickable=true&amp-image-height=360&amp-image-width=640&amp-image=https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/vjassets/img/app-launcher.png0&app-image-alt-text=Click%20or%20tap%20here%20to%20see%20interactive%20content After studying the valley to locate the original path carved out by the river, the charity enlisted a team of diggers to recreate that curvy channel. It is now about 180m (200 yards) longer than the straight line that had been in the valley bottom for two centuries. The transformation, says Lee, was almost immediate. ""About three months after the diggers left - we had salmon and trout spawning in the river again,"" he recalls. The re-established, meandering curves have slowed down the flow of water, which creates aquatic habitat at each bend. ""We now have vegetation in the river, where young fish can shelter,"" explained Lee. ""There are gravel banks, deep pools and riffles - shallow, turbulent parts of the river where the water draws in oxygen. It all benefits the whole food chain. ""It's like a living thing moving through the valley now, while the old, straightened river was just like a sad canal."" This restoration was expensive. Funded in equal parts by the RSPB, the Environment Agency, Natural England and the water company landowner, United Utilities, it cost just over £200,000 to rewiggle the 1km (0.6 miles) stretch. The government is currently funding a number of conservation schemes like this one under what is called the Landscape Recovery Scheme. Through this, farmers will be able to apply for money to boost biodiversity on their land, possibly by re-wiggling their own rivers or establishing more wild spaces like woodlands. But Alice Groom, the RSPB's head of sustainable land use policy says more funding is needed if the decline of nature in this country is going to be tackled. ""Last year's Landscape Recovery pilot was massively oversubscribed,"" she says. ""The Government should move swiftly to bring sufficient funding online to match the demand for those groups of farmers and landowners wishing to deliver for nature, climate and water quality."" For United Utilities, re-wiggling essentially means the river cleans itself. Artificially straightened rivers flow faster and pick up more sediment. In this case, that is carried downstream to the Haweswater reservoir. Curves slow down the flow and allow the river to deposit its sediment on the banks. That slowed flow also reduces the risk of flooding downstream. Somewhat ironically, environmental damage that water companies do in the future could also provide a funding source for restoration projects like this. Companies could soon face unlimited fines for dumping sewage, under recently announced government plans. Environment Secretary Thérèse Coffey has said that this money would be reinvested into a new water restoration fund amd be used for community-led river conservation projects. United Utilities itself was recently revealed to have released raw sewage into rivers more often than any other water company in England in 2022. John Gorst from United Utilites, who worked on the Swindale project, told BBC News: ""There are issues and we're addressing them. ""[But] this landscape is critical to us as a business. The reservoir is our single biggest supply, so we're investing in these catchments and managing them in a way that safeguards water quality and has all these additional benefits for biodiversity."" The RSPB runs its own farm in this valley and says it has shown that conservation and farming can work together and mutually benefit each other. Lee Schofield says seeing the river's clear, meandering water - and its wildlife - return is inspiring. ""We as a species can rebuild and restore places like this. We can create space for nature,"" he says. ",731,science,2023-04-25T00:36:17.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65341994
Fruit producers turn to nets for better crops," It's an elegantly simple solution to an age-old problem: to protect crops from hazards, keep them covered. Nets are commonly used to keep out pests in vegetable production, particularly in high-value areas like seeds. Yet in fruit production the use of nets is still being explored and tested, according to Mirella Aoun, an agronomist and researcher at Bishop's University in Quebec, Canada, who has been studying agricultural nets for over a decade. Prof Aoun explains that initially fruit producers placed nets over trees primarily to protect them from hail damage. Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects. The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects. Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees. One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives. Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, where nets draped over rows of apple trees limit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides. There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. ""When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,"" says Prof Aoun. Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases. Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that. For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis. But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada. But some researchers are working on hydrophobic nets, where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent. Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality. Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality. Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. As her research in the Mediterranean has shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit. Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions. Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence. More technology of business: One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax. It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net. Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked to European policies intended to reduce insecticide use. ""The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,"" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers. The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. ""Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,"" Mr Etienne acknowledges. Texinov's cheapest net sells for around €0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. ""The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,"" says Mr Etienne. Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. ""In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,"" she summarises. Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery Pépinière Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting. ""In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,"" he says. For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. ""I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,"" he explains. To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections. Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful. But Prof Aoun believes, ""As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.""

The coastal revival on Scotland's horizon," The spit of Moray Firth coast at Ardersier used to be of vital strategic significance in ensuring the Jacobite clans could never rise again, and the French could not get into the hearts of the Highlands to help them. That's why Fort George is an imposing structure, intended to intimidate. Nearby Ardersier Port could be on the way to becoming a vital strategic location for a different purpose, linking energy across the North Sea rather than defending from it. The 450-acre site used to be one of the big fabrication yards for the North Sea oil and gas industry, where thousands were employed by McDermott's to build vast structures for the pioneering offshore industry. It has been a forlorn site and sight for more than 20 years, despite much discussion of what could be done with it. But £300m of funding from a US energy investment fund, Quantum, says it's on the way back. Nearby, the Cromarty Firth and Inverness team that won the bid for Green Freeport status are working through the details of how it's going to work, between the powers of two national governments and one of the local variety. Having been announced in January, that could take 12 months. And while investors are being encouraged to line up their plans, clarity on how it works will take patience. Ardersier Port falls outside the boundaries, but even without those tax breaks, the numbers apparently stack up for Quantum investors to commit the funds for preparation of the site. And work is already under way, clearing the site and preparing it for the final quarter of next year, when the first customers are expected to move in, both for decommissioning of oil and gas equipment and - a far bigger prospect - the lay-down and assembly requirements for the enormous ScotWind projects being planned around the coast of Scotland. The project now has a chief executive in Lewis Gillies, an engineer from the north of Scotland, with 20 years experience with BP and 15 in private equity-backed energy projects. Taking over operations from the founding partners of this venture, he will work for a newly created parent company, given the name Haventus. A few miles away, as the gull flies, Nigg in Easter Ross was another legacy of the oil and gas boom years. Global Energy has re-energised it to become a key part of the Cromarty Firth freeport bid. There should be more than enough work to go around. Whereas other sectors might face the risk of being undercut by too much competing capacity, it's hard to imagine the east coast of Scotland having sufficient capacity for the ScotWind task ahead. So after several unhappy years as BiFab, the yards at Methil in Fife and Arnish near Stornoway are well-placed for more work as part of Harland and Wolff, including a good location on Lewis for the first wind farms in Scotland's Atlantic waters. Forth Ports is investing in Leith docks to prepare it for very large floating turbines to come alongside the strengthened quay. It shares the benefits ahead of green freeport status. Loch Kishorn on the Wester Ross coast is also being revived for offshore energy work, decades after being a centre for building concrete platforms. The prospects for large-scale manufacturing remain frustratingly distant, as equipment for offshore wind is fabricated elsewhere and then brought to the Scottish coast for final assembly and preparation for shipping out to the windfarm sites. Some hope is pinned on the new technologies required for floating turbines. Scotland had the first such wind farm, using Norwegian technology. Its pipeline of orders for floating wind, following a new round of bids to build out capacity to de-carbonise the energy required by offshore oil and gas platforms, is reckoned to be nearly a third of the current world total. Achieving the scale and efficiency required for fabrication in that is a huge ask for the Scottish engineering sector. Denmark took a lead in wind turbine design and manufacturing and Germany's engineering giant, Siemens, followed. These countries were part of a coalition of North Sea European Union members that agreed to work more closely together when they met in Denmark last year. This year, in the Belgian port of Ostend, they have invited the UK and Norway, as well as some without a North Sea presence but with a big interest in offshore wind; Ireland, France and - as a financial centre, Luxembourg. Moving away from dependence on Russian hydrocarbons has focussed attention on how best to co-ordinate across North Sea marine boundaries. A new power cable has been announced, linking the Netherlands and England - set to be one of the highest capacity links in the world. Over the horizon, a new generation of energy is taking shape. The potential for onshore support along the east coast of England and Scotland is drawing the UK closer to Europe, despite Brexit.

Glenrothes recycling plant in administration months after opening," A modern recycling plant in Fife has gone into administration only seven months after it opened, due to a lack of waste plastic. Yes Recycling of Glenrothes, which has 60 workers, is unable to pay its debts because it has been operating under capacity. Administrators Grant Thornton are looking for a buyer who can retain the business and staffing. Yes Recycling's parent company in Buckinghamshire is not affected. The Fife plant is based on the Whitehill Industrial Estate in Glenrothes and operates a 15,000 tonne per annum plastics recycling facility. It began production in September 2022, carrying out recycling of mixed plastics, both 2D and 3D. It specialises in turning hard-to-recycle flexible food packaging such as crisp packets and chocolate wrappers into plastic flakes, pellets and a new product called Ecosheet, which can be used in the construction and agriculture industries. Julie Tait, restructuring director at Grant Thornton said: ""While the business has invested heavily in state-of-the-art recycling equipment, it had not yet been able to operate at full capacity and this has resulted in cash flow challenges in recent weeks. ""The company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due resulting in our appointment as joint administrators. ""This is a disappointing outcome for all those associated with the company, and our immediate priority is to support the company's 60 employees while we assess the company's financial position and seek a buyer for its business and/or assets."" Yes Recycling had formed partnerships with Morrisons and Nestle in recent months. ",251,uk,2023-04-24T18:47:23.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-65379894
Longleat safari park's beloved hippo will be greatly missed," A safari park says one of its beloved hippopotamus' will be ""deeply missed"" after dying at the age of 49. Sonia had lived at Longleat in Wiltshire since 1976 and some of her keepers had looked after her for more than 40 years. Staff said her fellow hippo Spot appears to be doing well. ""It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to one of our veteran animal residents. Sonia... passed away peacefully."" a spokesperson said. Sonia lived at the park's Half Mile Lake and had been a firm favourite for visitors as part of the boat safari. The safari park said she had a big character which befitted her 1.5 tonne frame. ""She will be deeply missed by her devoted keepers. ""Despite the sad loss, fellow hippo, Spot, appears to be doing well and the animal team is keeping a watchful eye over her. ""Sonia even made history a few years ago when she became the first hippo to share UK waters with beavers in 100,000 years… not to mention the Californian sea lions who splash around there too,"" a spokesperson added. Hippos normally live for around 40-50 years and Sonia had almost reached her 50th birthday when she died. They are the third largest living land mammal and their teeth can reach up to 50.8cm (20 inches) in length. Despite their size, they can also reach speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h). Half Mile Lake is an artificial water feature which was designed by Capability Brown and dug by hand in the 18th century. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

LionLink: North Sea power line to connect wind farms to UK," A huge electricity cable project in the North Sea could provide green power to 1.8 million UK homes in plans announced by the UK and Dutch governments. It would connect to offshore wind farms and transfer electricity between the two countries. European nations are under pressure to fulfil climate promises to end reliance on fossil fuels and to improve energy security. The deal was announced on Monday at an energy summit in Ostend, Belgium. The power line, called LionLink, is being developed by the National Grid and Dutch electricity network TenneT and could be running by the early 2030s. The government claims LionLink will carry 1.8GW of electricity, giving it the largest capacity of any cross-border electricity line in the world. An existing cross-border connection between Germany and Denmark carries 0.4GW. ""We are bolstering our energy security and sending a strong signal to Putin's Russia that the days of his dominance over global power markets are well and truly over,"" said UK Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year caused energy prices to skyrocket as it disrupted gas and oil supplies from Russia to Europe. ""We are facing a climate crisis at the same time some of our ecosystems are in decline, and offshore wind is an integral part of both climate action and safeguarding our energy security,"" the leaders of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway and the UK wrote in news website Politico about the Ostend summit, which aims to increase wind power in the North Sea. The UK government has made legally binding commitments to become net zero by 2050 - meaning the UK should stop adding warming greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Experts says that will require a huge shift away from fossil fuels like oil and gas to greener sources of energy like wind and solar power. Existing UK plans have been criticised by environmentalists and experts as insufficient. Energy and climate think tank, the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) welcomed the news about LionLink. ""The North Sea oil and gas basin is in terminal decline, so unless the deployment of renewables as well as electric heat pumps and the basics like home insulation is sped up, we'll become more dependent on foreign gas imports,"" said Jess Ralston, Head of Energy at the ECIU. ""Under current government policy, these imports are set to increase, but cooperation like this should bring greater energy resilience and cheaper bills for households. The UK could get on track to being a net energy exporter,"" she added. ",424,science,2023-04-24T14:11:59.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65375943
Sheffield scientists call for ban on artificial grass," Householders should receive a council tax discount if they garden sustainably, researchers have said. Artificial grass and pesticides should also be banned to help protect the environment, according to a study by the University of Sheffield. Professor Ross Cameron said gardens must be ""full of plants to be beneficial to the local environment"". The government is aiming for everyone to be able to access green space within a 15-minute walk from their home. Some cities may have lost half of their green garden space over the past 20 years, with homeowners paving over areas for driveways and patios or replacing it with fake grass, the researchers said. Prof Cameron said this leads to rising urban temperatures, because plants help cool the air around them. ""Gardens account for a third of all our urban areas and are vital spaces in terms of keeping our buildings and city environments cool in summer, absorbing rain to avoid flash flooding and providing an important refuge for wildlife,"" he said. ""Many residents use artificial grass that kills much of the soil life underneath it, and when real plants are present, we wrongly assume we need to hit them with a cocktail of chemicals to keep them alive and free of pests."" The study, published in the journal Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, calls for policymakers to introduce incentives to make sure gardens are well planted, such as money off bills for householders and financial rewards for people who plant trees. Will Teare, 32, from Norton Lees, Sheffield, has planted his garden with vegetation that helps wildlife. ""The family gets a lot of enjoyment out of it, the birds coming to nest, or watching the frogs and newts around the pond, it brings the garden to life, and is a source of excitement for the kids,"" he said. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson said there were no plans to ban artificial grass or give people money off their bills for maintaining their gardens. But they said the government has launched a planning tool to help councils set a target for the amount of green space provided in new housing developments. ""Green spaces and parks in England deliver an estimated £6.6 billion of health, climate change and environmental benefits every year,"" the Defra spokesperson said. ""Our Green Infrastructure Framework will also help increase the amount of green cover to 40% in urban residential areas, supporting equal access to green space across the country.""

Northern Ireland's electricity network to get £3bn upgrade," NIE Networks is to invest over £3bn in Northern Ireland's electricity network over the next 10 years in order to facilitate climate change targets. It also plans to create more than 1,000 jobs between now and 2032 in an attempt to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. NIE Networks said the investment would help its 910,000 customers connect to low-carbon technologies like electric cars, solar panels and heat pumps. But it will mean an additional cost to customers of about £10 to £20 a year. NIE Networks owns the network of lines, poles and substations that takes electricity from power stations to homes and businesses. It does not generate electricity, nor does it sell power to consumers. Its managing director Derek Hynes said a ""significant step change"" was needed in the level of investment to ""facilitate the scale of decarbonisation"" required as a result of new climate change law. ""We believe that we will need to create 1,000 new jobs, including 400 apprenticeships in NIE Networks and up to 500 new jobs in our contractors and support partners, between now and 2030,"" he said. Mr Hynes added that it was important to be ""transparent with our customers"" about an increase in network charges of about £10 to £20 per year, but that it was ""critical we invest now to avoid higher costs in the future"". The Centre of Advanced Sustainable Energy (Case) said Northern Ireland's targets for dealing with climate change were ""ambitious"" but could not be met without major investment in energy infrastructure. ""In the long-term, we would see many benefits being realised through this investment,"" said Martin Doherty from Case. ""Alongside the positive economic impact on the supply chain and wider industry, this will go a long way to enabling Northern Ireland to meet the target of 80% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030 which, in turn, could ease the pressure on energy bills."" Details of the investment are part of NIE Networks' business plan, which was submitted in March to the Utility Regulator. The regulator will assess it and publish a draft determination for public consultation in November. The regulator is expected to publish a final determination and proposals on licence modifications in October 2024.

Goldman Prize honours indigenous woman who stopped mining giant," A leader from Brazil's indigenous Munduruku community has been recognised for her successful fight against mining in the Amazon rainforest. Alessandra Korap Munduruku, 39, has been awarded this year's Goldman Prize, which recognises grassroots activism. Her vocal campaign to protect the Munduruku territory saw her confronting mining giant Anglo American. As a result, Anglo American withdrew 27 research applications to mine inside indigenous territories. The company's move represents a rare victory of an indigenous community over one of the world's largest mining companies. Asked by the BBC if she found the prospect of taking on the mining giant daunting, Alessandra Korap Munduruku said that she had derived strength from the territory she aimed to protect. ""It [Anglo American] may be powerful to you, but to me, the powerful ones are the river, the strength of our territory and our people, the ant doing its work and the resistance of our people for more than 500 years in the fight for our land."" She also said that social media had played a key role in giving her struggle more visibility, thereby increasing the pressure on Anglo American. With the help of the Coalition of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) and pressure group Amazon Watch, Alessandra drafted an open letter calling for Anglo American to withdraw the permits to conduct mining research inside indigenous territories in the Brazilian Amazon. The permits had been issued without the indigenous communities' informed consent needed under Brazil's constitution. At first, the company denied having such permits but following an intense media campaign led by Alessandra, Anglo American said that the concerns raised by her convinced it to formally withdraw the more than two dozen research applications it had already been granted. Anglo American's move prompted Brazilian mining company Vale to follow suit, with the miner recognising that prospecting in indigenous territories required the consent of the communities. Alessandra says that she first became active in the defence of indigenous territories in 2014 after she had witnessed how gold mining was affecting her community. ""Where I live [in the Brazilian state of Pará, along the Tapajós river], there are more and more settlements springing up. My people rely on fishing to feed themselves. But there are already places where gold mining has contaminated the water and killed off the fish,"" she explains. ""When I was a child, I had immense freedom. We fished in the rivers and the lakes, we collected fruits and the seeds we use to make our handicrafts. But starting in 2014, I saw these areas turned into deserts by diggers and other big machines."" Alessandra says that it was these changes that jolted her from her life of looking after her children and her husband and turned her into an activist. But she says that it was not easy to take on a leadership role in her community at first. ""In our culture, it's traditionally the men who take decisions, it's the men who go hunting and fishing. We women are supposed to stay in our realm, looking after the husband, the children, and the home."" Alessandra was encouraged by another Munduruku woman, Maria Leusa Kaba Munduruku, to defy these rigid gender roles. I was already helping the caciques (indigenous chiefs) and she saw me and told me: ""Alessandra, continue, don't give up, you're going to get a lot of stick from the men, from the [male] chiefs, but we women can't give in."" She says that she always believed it was important for all voices to be heard, including those of the women and children, but that at first she encountered resistance. ""'Why do women want to speak up? Women should look after their husbands, not make speeches,' some chiefs told me,"" she recalls. When the Munduruku came under attack from illegal gold miners some years back, Alessandra's own mother begged her to take a step back, but she insisted she had to carry on the fight. ""Mum, while our community and our territory exists, I will carry on the fight [to defend them],"" I told her. Alessandra says that over the past decade, more and more women have joined the struggle to defend their territories and are now playing a key role. She is adamant though, that the key to victories like the one she achieved against Anglo American is built on bringing the entire community together. The open letter she sent to the company was based on an official declaration drafted in an assembly attended by 45 chiefs and 200 participants. ""We women don't want to overrule the caciques, but we do want to stand alongside them, deciding with them; our role as women is not to divide the community, but to bring everyone together.""

Work starts on 600-year-old Suffolk deathwatch beetle tomb," A 600-year-old tomb carved in memory of a Suffolk earl and his family is being taken apart by specialist conservators to be treated for a beetle infestation. The tomb of Michael de la Pole, the 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and his wife Katherine was constructed in about 1410 and is in St Andrew's Church, in Wingfield. To save money at the time, the effigies were not made of stone but carved in wood and plastered to look like stone. Work will start on Monday to rectify the wood damage done by the beetles. A teams of conservators from Cambridge will undertake the work, which is expected to last about three weeks. This will involve disassembling the tomb to treat the infestation and then preserving it. The experts have been brought in from Grantham-based company Skillingtons, which specialises in the conservation of buildings, sculpture and traditional plasterwork. Deathwatch beetles are serious wood-boring pests and their tunnelling can cause major damage, the Wildlife Trust says. They are ""famed for their tapping in the middle of the night, supposedly heralding tragedy"". The restoration of the Suffolk tomb has been made possible thanks to a grant of £10,000 from the Church Buildings Council, which St Andrew's Church said was ""in recognition of the national importance of the monument"".

Dreams: Can a drawing help unravel their secrets?," For as long as I can remember - at least once a week - I have experienced a recurring dream. Not exactly a nightmare, but nevertheless something which has confused and troubled me. I'm something of a counselling cynic, but when I heard about a sleep scientist and artist who had teamed up to try and interpret and explain our dreams, I was intrigued to see if they could get to the bottom of my concerns. Prof Mark Blagrove interviews people about their dreams, and Dr Julia Lockheart, a renowned artist from Swansea Art College, sketches their discussions to provide greater insight into their meaning. I am now 44, but in my dream I am 14 or 15 and transported back to my boarding school for blind and visually impaired students in Worcester. As it is 30 years hence, I am utterly confused as to what lessons I should be attending and where my files and textbooks are. Nevertheless I possess a superpower: I know everything that will happen in the next 30 years. To laughter, I try to explain to my classmates that by 2023 their mobile phones will be several times more powerful than our entire school network. I know who will win that year's FA Cup final, who will win the general election and which horse will succeed in the Grand National. I am desperately trying to put bets on with a bookie or call my partner Sarah, who I did not meet until 2013. However, everything on which I try to make a phone call is anything but a mobile - a pocket calculator, a TV remote control… nothing can connect me to the present day. As Prof Blagrove explains I have fears about getting my ideas across to other people - something of a problem for a BBC feature writer - Dr Lockheart creates an uncanny visual representation. She had no previous knowledge of the school where I grew up. Her pictures are drawn on pages of Freud's book The Interpretation of Dreams. She explained: ""The text has many linked words which are like the surrealist idea of object trouvé, or found objects, which I make into found poetry. An example of this is in the pointing finger in your hand which is dialling numbers on the TV remote, held tightly in your other hand. ""The sentence 'I was working principally on my own' is highlighted. It runs down the pointing digit which is punching the numbers in to make an impossible phone call. ""We have been given permission from the publishers of Freud for me to paint on to his writing and tear it out of the book to create a piece of psychological art."" Prof Blagrove said this was where art becomes science. ""Julia's paintings bring our dreams to life. ""We know through our empirical research that people who share their dreams have more empathy with each other, and seeing a visual interpretation only facilitates that process."" He added while there were many schools of thought about the nature and purpose of dreams, theirs was the only scientifically-proven research. ""There is a big body of consensus that dreaming has a biological function in terms of sorting and analysing thoughts from short-term to long-term memory. ""I don't necessarily disagree with that, but it's an unproven theory. ""What we can categorically say - through  controlled experiments - is that people who share their dreams and have seen Julia's imagining of them have greater empathy for each other than people who have met for the first time."" Prof Blagrove argues that this sort of discussion of our dreams leads to better social cohesion. Dr Lockheart concurred, saying sharing dreams through art was as old as life itself. ""From prehistoric cave art to Native Americans, there has been a Shamanistic connection with people sharing their dreams."" Many of the dreams shared by NHS professionals during the pandemic followed my pattern. Dr Lockheart said: ""Especially during the early days, nurses were telling us that they knew what was to come, and how it would impact on humanity. ""It's a bit like your dream, insofar as they have information that no-one else does, but they're powerless to control the situation. ""They described horribly disfigured trees, and even one when a cat was sat on their face smothering them."" Prof Blagrove and Dr Lockheart have just released a book based on their seven-year research findings called The Science and Art of Dreaming. They are about to undertake a European and American tour of their dream analysis, including at the Hay Book Festival in May.

1903 Ulysses Storm among windiest ever in British Isles," A mighty storm that tore across Ireland and the UK more than a century ago produced some of the strongest winds the British Isles have ever witnessed. Scientists reviewed Storm Ulysses of 1903 by digitising paper-based weather readings from the time and subjecting them to a modern reanalysis. Many places would have felt gusts in excess of 45m/s (100mph or 87 knots). The cyclone left a trail of death, shipwrecks, smashed infrastructure, uprooted trees and widespread flooding. ""We think it is likely that the winds were stronger in some locations than anything in the modern period 1950-2015,"" explained Prof Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. ""The precise values are a bit uncertain as the reanalysis does not produce gust values at the surface but they would have been pretty high to cause the damage we see in photos from the time - on a par with big storms in 1990, 1997, 1998 and the Great Storm of 1987,"" he told the BBC. Storm Ulysses is so called because it inspired a passage in James Joyce's famous novel Ulysses. O yes, J.J. O'Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. The windstorm blasted through the British Isles over 26 and 27 February. Its track ran across Ireland, northern England and Scotland. The Times newspaper recounted widespread damage, a sizeable number of injuries, and fatalities. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) reported 10 significant crew rescues from distressed ships. A pier in Morecambe was damaged, and a train in Cumbria was blown over. Ulysses' ferocity was well recognised at the time. But by reanalysing the raw weather observations from 1903, using the very latest modern numerical modelling techniques like those that produce today's daily forecasts, researchers have now obtained a new, more detailed appreciation of the event. The study was made possible by an army of volunteers who converted the hand-written records from 1903 into a spreadsheet format that could be fed into a 21st century supercomputer. The records - principally from the UK Met Office's ""Daily Weather Reports"" - included measurements of pressure, temperature, wind speed, sunshine and rainfall, and were taken at select sites across the British Isles and continental Europe. Atmospheric pressure is the key parameter for a modern simulation of the event. ""By recovering these observations and building them into our modern methods for making reconstructions, we can draw a picture of the atmosphere and how it was behaving at the time,"" said Prof Hawkins. ""And it looks very credible. It has winds simulated in the reconstruction that could have caused the damage that we see from the documentary evidence and the photographs."" A good example is the Leven River in Cumbria where the train toppled over as it crossed a viaduct. The simulation indicates there would have been winds above 40m/s (90mph or 78 knots) at that location on the morning of the 27th. The weather can always produce freak conditions in specific places, but when the British Isles region is considered as a whole - the reanalysis puts Storm Ulysses in the top five strongest wind events. Scientists say mining old meteorological data is a vital undertaking if we're to understand how our climate is changing. It's only by having dense historic data that we can put modern weather extremes in their proper context and see the full range of possibilities for the future. The difficulty is giving computers access to this information, some of which is centuries old. There are thought to be billions of hand-written data points sitting in meteorological archives around the world waiting to be transcribed. Volunteers working on ""citizen science"" platforms such as Zooniverse have made a dent in the problem but it will take an immense effort to recover the entire resource. What is the UK's strongest recorded wind gust? Co-worker from Reading, Dr Stephen Burt says: ""There are always some caveats about highest gusts, the two main difficulties being, firstly, that the instruments are working at the very edge of their capability; and, secondly, of course, that most such records come from very exposed sites. How representative such records are is open to question. ""But caveats aside, the highest UK low-level gust for which there is at least a reasonable balance of probability is that of 118 knots (61m/s) at Kirkwall, Orkney, at 09:12 GMT on 7 February 1969."" That's 136mph. Prof Hawkins and colleagues report their reanalysis of Storm Ulysses in the journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences. The Reading researcher will also present the project this week to the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria. He'll also be speaking on this week's Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service. ",810,science,2023-04-24T04:51:35.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65365106
Volunteers rally for Windermere water survey," Dozens of volunteers have been recruited for a mass sampling of water in England's largest lake. Concerns have been raised about the water quality in Windermere after raw sewage discharges and the presence of blue green algae. The Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) which runs the survey said it needed help so all the samples could be taken at the same time. Head of science Louise Lavictoire said it ""couldn't go out and sample 100 different points all at the same time in a single day"". She said it was ""fantastic"" to have help in terms of logistics ""but it also means that people understand a bit more about what is happening with the lake"". Data was available from samples taken from the middle of the lake but the FBA wanted to test water at the shoreline where ""most people interact"" with it, she said. Windermere is ecologically important and home to rare fish species such as the Arctic charr. Concerns have been raised about algal blooms and bacterial pollution and the potential harm to people and wildlife. The survey collected about 100 samples on Sunday which will be analysed for nutrients and bacteria. The FBA said there was less information available about how the lake's water changed through the seasons, which is why it intended to run the survey four times a year. The organisation said it had an ""excellent response"" to its call for volunteers, some of whom had helped with all four surveys carried out so far. ""We've got a lot of people who keep coming back because they recognise the importance,"" Ms Lavictoire said. ""The water quality and the bacterial quality of these water bodies changes over time, it's not static. ""The great thing about doing the same sites each time is that we can start the patterns and start to see where the problem points might be.""

Larne Lough: Swimmers protest against gas storage caverns plan," Swimmers have taken to the water at Islandmagee to protest against the building of gas storage caverns nearby. Seven gas caverns are set to be constructed by carving out salt layers under Larne Lough to store half a billion cubic metres of natural gas. The firm behind the project say it will create jobs and improve energy security by giving a 14-day buffer during periods of peak demand. Protesters say the caverns would pose a threat to the local environment. A marine licence for their proposed construction was approved by the Department of Agriculture and Environment (Daera) in October 2021, but is subject to a judicial review brought by opposition groups the No Gas Caverns campaign and Friends of the Earth NI. The two groups coordinated Saturday's protest swim at Brown's Bay in Islandmagee, County Antrim. The judicial review is due to begin on 2 May. The beach is an officially designated bathing site and generally popular with swimmers year-round, particularly during the summer months. About 30 swimmers took to the water under cloudy skies and heavy rain just after midday, with a further 20 or so supporters watching on from the shore. Most of the group stayed in the sea for about 15 minutes. Ahead of the swim, Lauryn Alexander, who lives locally and organised the event said she wanted to take part and show support for what she described as a ""community-wide effort"" to oppose the gas caverns. Analysis: Louise Cullen, BBC News NI Agriculture and Environment Correspondent Since it was first proposed, the gas caverns project has been controversial. Supporters say it would create jobs and give Northern Ireland security in the event of a disruption to energy supply. And they say the concentrated brine produced in making the caverns would disperse rapidly in the sea. Long-term, the caverns could be used to store hydrogen as a product of surplus renewable energy, maximising our wind power generation potential and making a contribution to reaching Net Zero. But campaigners say the hyper-saline water released in carving out the caverns threatens vulnerable species in several Areas of Special Scientific Interest along the coast, potentially creating a ""dead zone"". They fear building space for storing gas locks Northern Ireland into fossil fuel infrastructure that would damage Net Zero ambitions. The controversy shows just how difficult and delicate a balance it is to strike between human and environmental needs. She said that the beaches of Islandmagee have become a popular attraction for open-water swimmers from ""far and wide"", and that Saturday's swim was about protecting that natural environment which she says the caverns would ""ruin completely"". James Orr, director of Friends of the Earth NI, said that his organisation decided to get involved with the campaign because of the ""fantastic community who love their place and have been mobilising for a number of years"" and that it felt like a ""natural match"" for them to support the campaign. He added that the commitment to this campaign from its supporters was highlighted by the fact that they were willing to ""jump in the sea"". Mr Orr noted that the upcoming judicial review would be an ""opportunity to raise a whole range of environmental arguments against this project"". The groups say they have raised tens of thousands of pounds to fund legal costs for their judicial challenge to Daera's decision to grant the project a marine construction licence - £5,000 was donated by the non-profit organisation Wild Justice, part-owned by the broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham. On 2 April, the protest groups organised a so-called Boots on the Beach event, in which some 200 people marched along Brown's Bay beach in opposition to the gas caverns. Opposition to the project is largely based on environmental grounds. Campaigners say the construction process will involve the pumping of ""very salty water"" into Larne Lough, creating what they call a ""dead zone"" in which no animal life can survive. They also say that drilling will ward off certain marine animals. As the area is used by the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group to measure marine mammal sightings, they say that the drilling could interrupt a decades-long data set important in tracking the number of these animals. The marine area in Larne Lough and around Islandmagee has several designated protected areas. Islandmagee Energy says there will be no long-term damage to wildlife and that any impact created by the discharge of the brine (very salty water) will be localised to a small area at an approved distance offshore away from Larne Lough. It says the project will not affect any wildlife native to Islandmagee. Harland and Wolff, Islandmagee Energy's parent company, said that storage of gas in Northern Ireland ""is more important now than ever"". It said this was ""in order to ensure the long-term security of energy supply, which will protect consumers and businesses from volatile movements in the prices of energy, whilst ensuring businesses can continue operating and everyone is adequately supplied at all times of the year"". In a statement to BBC News NI, it said that the project would create about 1,600 direct and indirect jobs and bring about £400m into the wider economy. It said it will have a ""significant economic and social benefits to Northern Ireland"". It added that it had ""supplied the required documents to the relevant authorities who have issued approvals for the project to proceed, and we believe that we have satisfied or exceeded all of the requirements"". Deara has previously told BBC News NI that it is not in a position to comment while the issue is an ""on-going legal matter"".

Bristol Zoo Project merges the 'past and future' of wildlife conservation," A popular city wildlife attraction has been given a new name following the merging of two sites. Bristol Zoo Project is Bristol Zoological Society's 136-acre visitor destination formerly known as Wild Place Project. The name reflects the charity's ""past and future"" following the closure of Bristol Zoo Gardens, in Clifton, Bristol, last year. Opened in 1836, Bristol Zoo shut in September. Justin Morris, chief executive of the Bristol Zoological Society, said zoos have an ""important role to play"" to address the threat of extinction to wild animals and ""changing the name of our site marks the start of that journey"". Investment in the site will bring more of the world's most threatened species, including critically endangered black rhinos, red-necked ostriches, and endangered red pandas and mangabey monkeys, the society said. At almost 10 times the size of Bristol Zoo Gardens, it will also include new visitor facilities and play areas. Mr Morris said they are investing in the site of Bristol Zoo Project and finalising the designs with construction planned to start in 2024. A conservation campus for students will be developed at the heart of Bristol Zoo Project which will include conservation teaching, medicine and breeding facilities. The new name, which will be used from the summer, was chosen after polling visitors, employees and volunteers. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

How do you dispose of a giant whale from a beach?," A minke whale that washed up on an East Lothian beach has now been removed. The 31ft (9m) whale died when it hit rocks and came ashore at North Berwick on Thursday. The Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) believes it was taken to landfill, but said methods of disposing of a whale carcass can vary. Dr Andrew Brownlow, who runs the scheme, said that a post-mortem exam can reveal a lot about a whale's life and what influenced its death. He told BBC Scotland News about some of the options available to local authorities when removing a whale. Dr Brownlow said different requirements need to be balanced with making a decision about how to dispose of a carcass. He said: ""You need to remove a dead whale from a public beach so it doesn't cause distress to people, or begin to leak grease and body fluids into the environment, which are more unpleasant than they are hazardous. ""There are actually very few diseases that we've found - and we've looked very hard - which can be transmitted from dead carcasses."" Disposal options include taking the whale to a landfill site, burial on the beach or partial incineration. ""They can be taken away to our laboratories where they are post-mortemed,"" Dr Brownlow added. ""The skeleton is then often processed by the Museum of Scotland and added to their collection. ""The soft part goes for disposal in the same way as fallen stock do from farms."" Dr Brownlow said that it is important to return as much of the whale as possible back into the marine environment for ""nutrient recycling"". ""Simply taking them out of the beach, off the marine environment and incinerating them or taking them to landfill actually robs the marine environment of this really important nutrient source."" Whale carcasses can bring a dose of life-sustaining nutrients, including manganese, phosphorus, iron, zinc. ""You don't need very high levels of them but they are very important for cellular processes"", Dr Brownlow added. ""It's called whale fall - this is mainly thinking about animals of the deep ocean, but when they fall and die and sink to the bottom of the ocean, they form these little nutrient rich islands that can support a huge diversity of life."" He said that sharks and other scavengers will come and eat the soft tissues of a whale, while other smaller organisms, like worms will feed on the skeleton. Another way of returning a whale back to the environment can be through burying it on a beach. ""We can bury them on site and that's often very successful, although that has to be balanced against the backdrop of not creating a public nuisance of having a carcass on an amenity beach,"" he said. Dr Brownlow added that in some circumstances, a stranded whale can be towed back into the sea, although they have to be carefully positioned to avoid becoming a shipping hazard, especially as larger whales remain buoyant. The fate of the whale tends to depend on two factors: the size of the animal and where it has stranded. ""Some very big whales like fin whales and sei whales, if they strand on some remote island, then they can be left to break down naturally,"" Dr Brownlow said. ""It's amazing the speed with which scavengers, birds in particular can scavenge quite a lot from a whale and within a year or so, you're often just left with very clean bones and a very healthy marine ecosystem."" SMASS was set up to understand the causes of stranding for whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, large bodied sharks and even marine turtles. Dr Brownlow said he believes the minke whale, stranded in North Berwick this week, has been taken to landfill for disposal. ""It's pretty grim to be honest"", he said. ""I've been to landfill sites to do the post-mortem and it's a pretty dismal end to such a magnificent creature, ""It's a functional end for these animals rather than one that is actually desired, both from the point of view of scientists that have to do the research on them but also the respect to the animal.""

West Cumbria Muncaster Castle aims to be carbon zero," The heir to a 13th Century castle is aiming to power it entirely with renewable energy. Muncaster Castle in Ravenglass in west Cumbria was built as a defence against the Scots and has been home to the Pennington family for 800 years. It is connected to mains gas and electricity but now heat pumps and solar panels meet most of its needs. Ewan Frost-Pennington said the change to greener energy had ""transformed the place"". In the past they would turn on the gas boiler for an event and turn it off immediately afterwards. But the constant ground source heat was more economical and had ""really improved the comfort"", Mr Frost-Pennington said. On a sunny day the solar panels provided more power than the castle needed, he added. Mr Frost-Pennington, 32, spent seven years working as a renewable energy consultant in London and California before returning last year to live in the castle with his parents. He now runs Muncaster's tourism operations and hopes to turn the Grade I listed building into the UK's first carbon-free castle. ""Like anyone we use energy to go about our daily business - we attract customers from far afield,"" he said. ""We want to be able to only have a positive impact on the environment."" To pay for the green energy projects Mr Frost-Pennington is planning new events to attract visitors. But he also stresses the castle's history will be respected and preserved, conscious that it's ""always dangerous"" to meddle with tradition. ""Hopefully I'll do a good job and I can be added to one of the good guys in the history and not relegated to the red list that we have within the castle of the family members that didn't do a good a job,"" he said.

Survey to look at impact of cyberbullying," A survey looking at the extent of harassment and bullying that children face online has been launched by Kent's Police and Crime Commissioner. Matthew Scott says he wants to understand the kind of content young people are viewing so programmes and strategies can be developed to protect them. Over 90% of children in the UK have access to a PC, laptop, games console or tablet with an internet connection, statistics show. ""We’ve all heard the terrible stories of young people who feel they can’t escape their tormenters and the impact this has on their lives,"" said Mr Scott. The survey includes questions such as what sort of device they have, how long they use it for and whether they have received unwanted messages or attention online. Young people under the age of 18 are encouraged to fill it in, which can be done anonymously, alone or with an adult.

BeReal increases daily post limit," Remember summer and those record-breaking temperatures? The weather wasn't the only thing that was hot. BeReal was the must-have app, hooking millions of downloads with its one-post-a-day take on social media. At a random time, an alert prompts you to drop everything and post photos of whatever you're doing. No warning, no filter. But with user numbers reportedly down, its makers want you to BeRealer - and post up to three times a day. Users in the UK will be the first to test the new feature, with other countries set to follow. Previously, a notification telling you ""It's Time to BeReal!"" was a sign you had two minutes to take a photo and upload it. With the new update now available, if you post on time, you'll get two chances to post a ""Bonus BeReal"". These extra photo sets can be uploaded on the same day at whatever time you like. BeReal was a surprise success when it was first launched by young French entrepreneur Alexis Barreyat. People were attracted to its focus on capturing users off-guard. It was seen as an alternative to the curated, filtered feeds of other social media apps, and was even named Apple's App of the Year 2022. It encourages you to share posts with a small circle of close friends, so it's not the place to look for clout. But it didn't stop certain moments, like Harry Styles shooting a BeReal post in the middle of a gig, from going viral outside the app and driving its popularity. And when the suspiciously similar TikTok Now feature was launched, it was clear that BeReal was having an influence. But there are reports that downloads have slowed down, and that fewer daily users are returning. That can be a problem, because investors like to see user numbers and engagement - the time people spend using the app - going up. Adding new features is a good way to keep people interested, but it can backfire. Remember when your Instagram feed suddenly looked like TikTok? So BBC Newsbeat asked BeReal some questions about the new features. It doesn't put people up for interviews because it doesn't want to be represented by a single figure - but sent some responses from its whole team. Despite reports of falling user numbers, the company says it's still growing and, according to its own data, has 20 million daily users. They didn't want to comment on TikTok Now, but say they ""think it's healthy and important for companies to constantly iterate to provide the best features for users around the world"". The team says allowing users to post more gives them the ""freedom to share the special moments in their life that happen outside the two-minute window"". And, despite the more relaxed rules on bonus posts, they say authenticity is still at the heart of BeReal. ""We welcome anyone who wants to stay connected with close friends and family to try our new features and give us their feedback so we can continue to improve our experience.""

Twitter gives fake Disney account verified status," Twitter gave a fake Disney account verification status at the weekend. The account, called @DisneyJuniorUK, was tweeting vile content, but managed to be verified with a gold tick before being suspended. The owner alerted his followers by saying ""this isn't actually real right. someone pinch me or something"" - and the tweet has since gone viral. It comes as confusion continues at how Twitter's updated verification system is working. Twitter has been approached for comment. Meanwhile, the ""real"" Disney Junior account has also been given a gold badge. Last week Twitter dropped blue marks from ""legacy"" verified accounts and there is a new colour scheme to its verification system - under the guidance of owner Elon Musk. Despite many celebrity accounts initially losing their badges - over the weekend most of them were reinstated, with almost every user with more than one million followers receiving a new blue tick. Social media consultant Matt Navarra told the BBC the decision to remove legacy checkmarks was a big mistake, ""possibly Elon's biggest Twitter mistake so far"". ""Twitter has swung from crisis to crisis in the past six months, since Elon took ownership of the platform,"" he said. ""He has now created the perfect breeding ground for fake accounts and misinformation, with no real way of keeping its users (or other brands) safe from the mess of his own making. It would not surprise me if we start to see more brands distance themselves from Twitter following this latest blunder."" This verification is being shared far and wide as an early example of exactly what critics of Elon Musk have warned about - fake accounts getting a badge of authenticity, giving them free rein to share misinformation under a fake veneer of authority. In this case, the owner of the account seems as amazed as everybody else that it's happened - it wasn't exactly trying to pretend to be an official Disney platform. And that asks even more questions- how did this obvious parody end up with a free gold tick? Twitter has already rolled back free blue ticks for accounts with more than a million followers, and there are increasing numbers of accounts who seem to have badges  for which they haven't paid. When Mr Musk took over, he said he wanted to level the playing field on Twitter. It wasn't fair, he said, that Twitter alone got to decide which voices were more important than others. But there's also a responsibility that goes along with running a social network, and so far we are seeing lots of examples of his dream of social media by subscription not quite going to plan.

Fifa no more? EA Sports rebrands its biggest game," ""Fancy a game of Fifa?"" A question that has been asked by millions of people to friends and family across the world for nearly 30 years. Later this year, however, that question will have to be rephrased as Electronic Arts (EA), the developer behind one of the most successful franchises in gaming history, moves on to its new football game, EA Sports FC. Although no gameplay will be available to see until July, the work of trying to encourage Fifa's estimated 150 million players to switch has started already. The new game's logo has been displayed on advertising boards in Premier League grounds and EA has also unveiled its FC Futures programme, which it says will support grassroots football projects across the world. David Jackson, EA Sports FC's vice-president of brand, told the BBC this is ""the right time for us to create our own narrative and be able to craft our own future"". Leaving behind a recognisable brand is a risk in any industry, especially so in  gaming where name recognition and brand loyalty are particularly pronounced. The key will be ensuring players realise what is changing but, perhaps most crucially, what is not. Mr Jackson emphasised that more than 19,000 footballers, 700 teams and 30 leagues will still be represented in the game, despite the split from football's governing body. ""We have to continue to show people that certain things will also be retained around the realism they know and love from a Fifa series,"" he said. ""That will stay with us as we transition from Fifa to FC, but players should also expect for things to change and innovate as well. ""People should expect to see some exciting developments now we have the opportunity to think expansively about the future of interactive football."" Simon Cardy, senior editorial producer at games website IGN, has reviewed many Fifa games over the years and thinks the challenge will be informing more part-time players. ""For the core player base I think they'll be fully aware of the rebrand,"" he said. ""It's the more casual video game fan, or let's say, a less clued-in family member looking to get their family member a new game as a present, that may find themselves confused over the coming months. It will be interesting to see how EA market the game on a broader scale without using the acronym Fifa."" EA is still making content for the current and final version of Fifa, so will not reveal any details about the new game until July. ""We appreciate people wanting to know more and there will be a lot more news to come. We would love for people to feel confident in what we will be delivering,"" said Mr Jackson. ""For now though I think the most important thing is we are listening to players. and working with our partners to deliver on realism and authenticity."" EA says fans can expect features like Ultimate Team, Career Mode and Pro Clubs to continue. Mr Cardy thinks that getting people discussing the game now is a savvy move by EA. ""I think they made the smart decision to announce the rebranding well in advance of this year's release, even before Fifa 22's release, therefore giving the fanbase plenty of time to get their heads around it. ""That familiarity will ease the transition to the new branding, which we've already seen is playing into the nostalgia of the 30-year Fifa series. ""Ultimately, I don't think the change in direction will hurt EA too much at all, but Fifa [the governing body] on the other hand, will be the ones left feeling the effects of the break-up more."" Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last month it is planning to compete with EA Sports FC in the future, and will keep its video game brand alive. He said: ""The new Fifa game, Fifa 25, 26, 27 and so on, will always be the best e-game for any girl or boy."" His comments caused surprise, given the complex and expensive nature of making a game of this scale. It is clear that with EA Sports FC, people should expect more interaction between the digital game and football in the real-world going forward. It has been suggested before that the game might try to become a global hub for football content, offering viewing rights to some matches alongside the game itself and support for real-world events or tournaments. However, none of this has been confirmed. Mr Jackson says: ""We do see ourselves as the world's game. And as a result, we need to meet players and fans, where they are. This is a great embodiment of our commitment to football in general. ""It's our plan to ensure our fans' love of football can be grown from the grassroots all the way up. Our job is to blur the lines between the virtual and real in the new game."" EA made about £5.5bn in net revenue in 2022, and a significant chunk of that will be down to Fifa's success. Getting this switch right is big for the firm, with the team running it saying they are not nervous but ""excited to get going"". So will it be ""fancy a game of FC?"" in future?

The wedding tech now at the heart of couples' nuptials," Instead of traditional gold bands, Czech couple Jiri and Ondrej Vedral exchanged smart rings on their wedding day. Smart rings are wearable electronic devices with functions similar to smartwatches. They typically allow the user to monitor his or her heartbeat, and make a contactless payment. It's a fast-growing tech sector, reported to be seeing global sales rise by 21% a year. Jiri and Ondrej's smart rings are, however, designed to be more romantic than most - they allow them to see and feel each other's heartbeat. Each ring is connected by Bluetooth to an app on the wearer's smartphone. And via the app two rings can be linked together. So every time Jiri presses his wedding ring, it both physically pulses with Ondrej's heartbeat, and displays the heartbeat as a moving red line. And the same in reverse for Ondrej. As long as their mobile phones are both connected to the internet, they get a real time heartbeat. If either is offline, they get the last recorded one. ""We were never into gold and diamonds,"" says Jiri. ""We wanted something different, so we liked the idea that this was something new. We feel like pioneers in this."" The rechargeable ring, called the HB Ring, is made by Czech firm The Touch. Although the first iteration went on limited sale back in 2016, the company is now seeing an increase in global interest thanks to the wider surge in the smart ring sector. In addition, the business has this year launched a new parallel product - The Touch Locket. To be worn on a necklace, this has the same technology as the smart rings. Its target customers include engaged couples who might like the idea of being able to feel their loved one's heartbeat, but don't want to forgo having traditional wedding rings. Jiri and Ondrej are among the many couples now increasingly using tech in their wedding celebrations. From drones for wedding photography, to digital tools to help with wedding planning tasks, such as managing the budget and seating arrangements, tech has infiltrated many important aspects of the wedding day. The wedding tech trend is growing as a result of people conducting so much of their lives on their smartphones, says Zoe Burke, the lead editor for UK wedding planning website Hitched.co.uk. ""I think people just take it for granted now that you'll be able to plan your wedding through your phone. You probably met your partner through your phone,"" she says. A third of couples in the UK are now said to use WhatsApp to invite guests to their wedding, and 60% announce their engagement on social media. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Some people are even now using artificial intelligence (AI) software to write their wedding vows or speeches. US-based wedding planning website Joy recently launched an AI tool that can do all this for you. Called ""Wedding Writer's Block Assistant"", it is based on ChatGPT, the chatbot founded by the San Francisco-based tech firm OpenAI. Vishal Joshi, co-founder and chief executive at Joy, says that rather than killing off the romance involved in writing vows or speeches, the aim of the AI tool is to make life easier for people who have difficulty putting their feelings into words. ""We did a survey, and found 89% of respondents find it overwhelming to start writing their wedding material,"" says Mr Joshi. ""The AI tool is not supposed to replace human emotions, but for many people it's helpful."" The global coronavirus pandemic helped pave the way for tech-based weddings, with couples that didn't postpone their nuptials getting married over Zoom or livestreaming their ceremony to guests at home. But virtual weddings now suffer from their association with Covid-19 restrictions, according to Ms Burke. ""People have moved away from livestreaming weddings. They don't want to be reminded of that time,"" she says. For couples dealing with spiralling costs brought about by higher inflation, utilising tech can save money, such as sending out e-invitations instead of posting out paper ones. This also has an environmental benefit. Rohita Pabla, a wedding planner based in London, says: ""It's about cost saving and being environmentally conscious. More and more couples are thinking about the environment."" Making an impact on social media during the big day is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, now a huge focus for many, with couples and guests posting videos on TikTok or Instagram during the wedding and the following reception. One new development in this direction is the growing trend of hiring ""gif booths"" for the reception. These are photobooths that take short bursts of photos to create gifs, or moving images. The user then simply enters his or her mobile number, and the gif is immediately sent to their phone. ""Some [couples] want the pictures to get picked up and shared over multiple different platforms,"" adds Ms Pabla. ""They want to be the Instagram couple."" But couples also need to cater for their less tech savvy wedding guests, or those who prefer to get their invitations the traditional way. Ms Pabla, who specialises in planning South Asian weddings, says that many couples she works with ensure they observe certain traditions alongside using tech-based solutions. For example, in traditional Indian weddings, it's customary for the bride and groom to give family members and older guests a physical wedding invitation in person. ""So the couple will get a few copies of invitations made and those will be for parents and grandparents,"" says Ms Pabla. ""But for their peers the same age they'll just send them a digital invite."" Mr Joshi adds that wedding tech can be used to ""make everything easier and much more interesting"". Yet he cautions that at the same time you need to avoid the risk ""of losing the charm and the romance of what real weddings are about, which is essentially bringing friends and family close together"".

Millions of families miss out on cheap broadband," More than half of low income households in the UK are in the dark about bargain broadband deals, according to a new report by communications regulator Ofcom. It is concerned people are not getting the right advice when it comes to switching to a social tariff. Social tariffs are low-cost broadband deals offered to customers on benefits and cost between £10 and £20 a month. Ofcom says millions of families could save around £200 a year by switching. Although take up of these deals has quadrupled since January last year, the majority of people are still missing out on the savings it says. One of the main reasons, according to the the regulator, is that families do not know about the deals. Reduced social tariffs allow UK households receiving government benefits such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support to pay less for internet and telecoms access. Current providers include BT, EE, SMARTY, Community Fibre, NOW, Sky, Virgin Media, KCOM, Hyperoptic, G Network and VOXI. Ofcom says it is also urging TalkTalk and O2 to introduce social tariffs in the broadband and mobile markets respectively. Around 4.3 million UK households could be getting cheaper broadband, but only around 220,000 people - or 5% of households - are currently signed up to the offer, according to Ofcom. Consumer groups are urging customers to act now and look at the packages available - especially given the cost of living crisis. As well as being much more affordable, social tariffs are usually on shorter-term contracts. Plus there are no early exit fees - so people are not tied to the contract if their circumstances change, and you can leave without paying a penalty. According to Ofcom's affordability tracker one in three UK households had an issue affording their communication services, reflecting the ongoing pressures that people are facing. Ofcom says more than half of eligible households continue to be unaware of social tariffs and that more needs to be done to encourage people to get the support - a similar plea was made last year. The watchdog is concerned that broadband providers are still not being upfront with millions of customers about how to find and sign up to these packages. Of eligible customers that are aware of social tariffs, most had heard about them through social media and from television. But just 9% found out about social tariffs through their provider. Ofcom says that highlights how the industry needs to go further to promote their social tariffs effectively and make them easier to find. Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's director of network and communication, said she believed broadband providers should go further, ""at a time when these savings could make a massive difference"". ""We're urging anyone who thinks they could be eligible for a discount deal to contact their provider today and potentially save hundreds of pounds,"" she said.

Twitter's blue tick restored to high profile accounts," Some Twitter accounts with more than one million followers have had their blue tick badges re-instated by Twitter without paying to subscribe. Beyoncé, Harry Kane, Richard Osman and Victoria Beckham are among those to have their blue tick back. The BBC News Twitter account also has its gold badge again, but has not paid for it. Before the platform was bought by Elon Musk, the blue tick was a badge of verification given for free by Twitter. It was originally used as a tool of authentication, designed to help stop fake accounts and the spread of misinformation. Now it is a symbol that an account has subscribed to a premium service called Twitter Blue - and there is a verification process attached with making the payment. There are various prices depending on where the subscription is made but it is around $8 per month. Those with a blue tick from the original verification process, who decided not to pay the subscription fee, began losing their ticks on 20 April. The broadcaster James O'Brien, who has 1.1m followers, is one of those who has now got his blue tick back after losing it. He confirmed that he had not paid for his account. He also noted that some accounts with fewer than 1m followers also appeared to have had their blue ticks restored, ""anointed entirely at Elon Musk's discretion"". Eliot Higgins, who founded the investigations organisation Bellingcat, confirmed to me on Friday that his blue tick, and Bellingcat's verification, had been given to him for free. Mr Musk has claimed that he paid for the subscriptions himself on behalf of the author Stephen King, the actor William Shatner and the basketball player Lebron James who had all criticised the scheme. At the time of writing, some celebrities like actor Ryan Reynolds who also owns Wrexham football club, still has no blue tick despite having over 21m followers. It was reported that the removal of the legacy blue ticks had to be done manually so it is possible that this is also a manual process which will continue over the coming days. Twitter Blue has had a troubled launch. It was initially delayed after fake accounts sprung up pretending to be official organisations, and in recent weeks both subscribers and formerly verified accounts have looked the same. Subscribers' tweets have higher visibility, individual posts can be longer, and they will see fewer ads. Elon Musk has previously said that the firm's finances were in dire straits when he took over and that Twitter was operating at a loss of $4m per day. Twitter has not revealed how many people have chosen to subscribe so far but the app firm Sensor Tower estimated to TechCrunch that the platform had around 386,000 subscribers in March 2023. This does not include subscriptions made on Twitter's website rather than within its app but is still a small fraction of its roughly 300 million user-base.

Manx mobile networks not included in UK emergency-alert system," Isle of Man phone networks will not be included in a test of the UK government's emergency alert system on Sunday. A message, accompanied by a loud siren-like sound or vibration lasting for about 10 seconds, will be sent to mobile phones in the UK from 15:00 BST. A Manx government spokesman said the test may see some island residents receive a test message on their phones. However, residents would ""not need to take any action"", he said. He said, while the island has not been included in the roll out, in some cases ""where a resident's phone is connected to a UK network signal because of their location on island, they may receive one of these messages"". ""These messages are not sent to mobile numbers specifically, but are pushed out to all phones as a cell level broadcast,"" he said. ""Please be aware that even if your mobile phone is on silent, these emergency alerts will produce sound and vibration for around 10 seconds."" The system is set to be used in future by the UK government or emergency services on rare occasions where there was a threat to life. Messages with advice on how to stay safe will be sent in cases of severe flooding, fires, or extreme weather. In most cases it will be targeted at very specific areas, rather than the entire country and may not be used for months or years, according to officials. The UK minister in charge of the system, Oliver Dowden, previously said the new system was a ""vital tool to keep the public safe in life-threatening emergencies"" and insisted a national test of the system was needed.

UK emergency-alert system: What is it and when is the test?," A UK-wide emergency alert system will be tested on Sunday. A message is set to appear on the home screens of mobile phones and tablets from 15:00 BST, accompanied by a loud siren-like sound or vibration lasting for about 10 seconds. The government says the new system is a ""vital tool to keep the public safe in life-threatening emergencies"". The test alert will say: ""This is a test of Emergency Alerts, a new UK government service that will warn you if there's a life-threatening emergency nearby. ""In a real emergency, follow the instructions in the alert to keep yourself and others safe. ""Visit gov.uk/alerts for more information. ""This is a test. You do not need to take any action."" Phone users can swipe away the alert message or click ""OK"" to continue using their phone as normal. The alerts will work on all 4G and 5G phone networks and on devices with the following software: Older ""non-smart"" phones will be unable to receive the alerts, and nor will devices that are turned off or on aeroplane mode. The alert will sound on phones on silent mode. The government says emergency services will have other ways to notify those without a compatible device. The alert is expected to reach about 90% of mobile phones. Despite the government strongly recommending enabling devices to receive alerts, users can opt out. This can be done by searching in settings for ""emergency alerts"" and turning off ""severe alerts"" and ""extreme alerts"". Personal data about a user's device or specific location will not be collected or shared, according to the Cabinet Office. The alerts will be broadcast from mobile-phone masts to every compatible phone and tablet within range. The government or emergency services do not need to know the mobile-phone number or any other personal data. Domestic-abuse campaigners, including the charity Refuge, warn the test could endanger some vulnerable people by potentially alerting an abuser to the location of a hidden phone. The government says it has been engaging with the organisations to ensure vulnerable people were not adversely affected. Refuge has produced a video showing how to turn off the alerts. Drivers are also advised not to look at or touch their phone until it is safe to do so, just as when receiving calls or messages. Emergency alerts, with advice about how to stay safe, will be sent - locally or nationally, by the government or emergency services - on rare occasions where there is a threat to life. They will initially focus on the most serious weather-related events, such as: But many people will not receive an alert for months, perhaps even years. Many countries around the world use emergency-alert systems, including the United States, the Netherlands and Japan. Japan credits its system with saving countless lives in natural disasters. The US system allows the president to send a message to citizens directly. But it does not always go to plan. In 2018, in the US state of Hawaii, an alert warning of an incoming missile was sent in error, causing widespread panic. ",510,uk,2023-04-22T07:50:24.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65177316
Twitter blue tick: Multiple Hillarys and New Yorks as verifications disappear," Twitter's removal of blue ticks is forcing accounts to find new ways to prove authenticity as concerns over copycats mount. At the same time, Elon Musk has given blue ticks to a few celebrities who didn't ask for one, such as writer Stephen King. And labels describing media organisations such as the BBC have disappeared. Twitter insiders say it adds to the sense of chaos under Mr Musk. The company has scrambled to suspend copycat accounts after the blue tick verifications - once a status symbol and a sign of authority - were culled. An account posing as Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which are currently battling the Sudanese army in a major power struggle - tweeted that its leader, Hemedti, had been killed. Although the account is fake, it does have a blue tick - while the real account does not. Twitter's own public metrics indicated the tweet has been seen well oven a million times. Within a few hours of losing verification, an account posing as Hillary Clinton, complete with the same profile picture as the former US senator, ""announced"" she would again run for the presidency. The account was suspended. And in New York City, a new handle claimed to be the ""authentic Twitter account"" representing the local government - it was then suspended and the official account was forced to put out a statement. Stephen King, with whom Mr Musk frequently interacts on Twitter, wrote: ""My Twitter account says I've subscribed to Twitter Blue. I haven't."" Mr Musk replied: ""You're welcome namaste."" LeBron James also still has a blue tick, despite saying he would not pay to be verified. On Friday morning, Mr Musk revealed he personally paid the Twitter Blue subscriptions for Mr King and Mr James. Star Trek actor William Shatner also got the same deal. But celebrities such as Beyoncé and Cristiano Ronaldo have had their blue ticks removed. Meanwhile some commentators have begun describing having a blue tick as embarrassing - ""it's a signal you paid for it,"" wrote Cornell University Professor Kaushik Basu. One fan account for Pakistan cricketer Babar Azam said Twitter had become a ""funny place"" where a ""fan page has a Blue Tick but Babar Azam don't"". Other users noted the irony that actor Jason Sudeikis had lost his verification, while Ted Lasso, the fictional character he portrays, had not. However company insiders have told the BBC that the upheavals put users at risk of harm. Making blue ticks an $84 (£67) paid-for service will make it hard to distinguish real accounts from others impersonating them. That's because blue verification ticks have long been the language used to communicate whether an account is who they say they are on Twitter. Trusted news accounts did have gold ticks, but even those have disappeared - at least for now. Other high-profile accounts - like Pope Francis - now have grey ticks; others are tick-less. Twitter says the grey ticks are for governments or multilateral organisations and their officials. Meanwhile some of the accounts that have bought blue ticks appear to be trolls or have a history of pushing disinformation. Because of the verified tick, users might be under the impression these accounts are trusted, and the posts they're sharing are sanctioned - but that will not always be the case. In the case of a fake New York City government account, a lack of verification in such cases could be confusing at best and dangerous at worst. For example, it could decide to share fake or misleading news about a public emergency or an extreme weather warning, conceivably putting people at risk. So users may now need to dig deeper and look for other clues to spot who is genuine, such as old tweets or a high follower count. The company first introduced the verification feature in 2009, after a former professional baseball player sued Twitter over imposter accounts. Since acquiring Twitter in late 2022, Mr Musk has attempted to overhaul the social media company to turn a profit. The decision to monetise verification could usher in a massive cultural and power shift on the platform. Mr Musk has tried to frame the decision to do away with verification as a way to democratise content on the site. But critics have argued the move will amplify disinformation as Twitter Blue subscribers will get prioritised rankings - Mr Musk has said that only verified accounts will appear in the site's prominent For You stream. Social media monitors and experts fear the rise in paid verification will lead to an amplification of misinformation on the site. If that were to happen, it could scare off yet more advertisers - and undermine any extra revenue Twitter is getting from its verification subscription model. But Mr Musk said pain is a part of change. ""I feel like we're headed to a good place,"" he told BBC News. ""Overall, I think the trend is very good.""

Is time up for Twitter?," It is almost a year to the day since Elon Musk announced that he wanted to buy Twitter. It was my first day in this job, and it was not exactly a quiet start. I have lost count of how many times since then, I have been asked whether Twitter is going to fail, and I have always said no. But now, I am not so sure - for a number of reasons. What we are about to see is the dawning of a whole new Twitter. From now on, accounts have a blue tick because they are paying a monthly subscription, not because Twitter wants you to know that they are genuine. There is of course a verification process involved in making that payment, but there are also already examples of fake accounts choosing to pay, in order to impersonate high-profile individuals and organisations. Earlier this month, the personal finance expert Martin Lewis discovered a subscribed account, in his name, promoting a crypto-scam to thousands of followers. Needless to say, it was not actually him. Those who pay, rather than those who are chosen, will now benefit from higher visibility across the platform - so what we will see in the coming days is who the new Twitter crowd really is. Twitter has not released any figures, but one analyst claimed that subscriber numbers appear to be a fraction of its 300 million user-base. If user engagement goes down because only some people ever get any virtual airtime, will it simply get boring? Owner Elon Musk said he did not think it was fair that Twitter got to decide who was important under the old regime. And perhaps he has a point there. But there are reports that under his watch, some people have been offered verification for free. The founder of the investigation platform Bellingcat confirmed to me that his organisation is one of them. Mr Musk also claims that he has personally paid for the subscriptions of Stephen King, LeBron James and William Shatner - who are all critics of the Twitter Blue monthly subscription scheme. In addition, Twitter now says that only businesses who pay for verification will be allowed to advertise, unless they are spending more than $1,000 (£807) per month. That is quite a chunk of change for a small business, and what we know about digital advertising revenue is that most of it comes not from the giant brands with huge campaigns, but the combined cash flow of small, regular advertisers. But that aside, all of this suggests that Twitter under Mr Musk, the so-called free speech absolutist, is not entirely a level playing field after all... People do not generally like to leave communities, and Twitter might be small and chaotic, but it is considered influential. It was being run badly. Its finances were in dire straits and like other platforms, it was struggling to keep abuse and misinformation under control. Mr Musk is a shrewd entrepreneur with deep pockets and an enormous following. I knew he would be controversial, but I thought he would turn  around the ship. News organisations which have stopped tweeting as a result of the changes include the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and NPR. Celebrities like singer Elton John, comedian Stephen Fry and model Gigi Hadid have all closed their accounts since Mr Musk took over. The BBC says it will not pay for verification and has already lost its ""gold check"" verifying it as a news organisation. The BBC News Twitter account has started following individual journalists like me, as a kind of alternative sign of authenticity. It will be interesting to see other workarounds spring up from different organisations - or whether they will decide that it is simply not worth the effort, especially with minimal visibility under the new regime. Lots of people have been amused by the passing of the blue tick. ""Happy losing blue tick day, to all who celebrate,"" wrote a friend of mine on a group chat on Thursday. Others joked about being ""ticked off"", and I am almost certain it is the only time I will ever manage to get the Pope, Beyonce, Harry Kane and Victoria Beckham into the same sentence for a radio cue. I suspect they will not mourn their blue ticks and neither will I - you will just have to take BBC News's word for it that I am who I say I am. But like many others, I will be keeping a close eye on the new direction the platform takes, in terms of both a work and a social tool. With impeccable timing, Jack Dorsey, who created Twitter in the first place, is slowly opening up a new network called Bluesky, which is unashamedly Twitter-like in its design. It is a very small, invitation-only space so far but it is creating a great deal of excitement, not least because it promises in the future to be interoperable - that is, compatible with other platforms. I am on it and it currently feels like we have all arrived at a party and are admiring the decor. But there may be an opening for a new ""small but influential"" space, and there is a chance Bluesky could be it. Let us hope Mr Dorsey has learned a thing or two about running a business since he sold Twitter. ",893,technology,2023-04-21T12:03:29.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65348171
Whickham man who scammed victims out of £1m jailed," A ""cruel and deceptive"" man who scammed his victims, including vulnerable elderly people, out of more than £1m has been jailed. Paul Henderson, 55, of Mansion Heights, Whickham, stole from 23 people through investment fraud over several years. His victims said their lives had been ""complete altered"", and had lost their retirement and pension funds. He earlier admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and was jailed for eight years and nine months. On Thursday, Newcastle Crown Court heard how Henderson defrauded his victims from 2012, up until his arrest in March 2018. The North East Regional Organised Crime Unit (NEROCU) launched an investigation and its officers carried out inquiries on his bank account, documents and identified victims. They found Henderson had developed false investment schemes, persuading his victims to transfer funds to him. The unit said in court victims said his criminal actions had left a lasting impact on them, including taking money which was meant for retirement. It said another victim, who had died from Covid during legal proceedings, was represented by his mother. She said he had wanted to help other victims who had suffered financial loss. After sentencing, temporary Det Insp Thomas Maughan from NEROCU, said Henderson had shown ""no consideration"" for the impact on his victims. He said: ""He is a cruel and deceptive man who will now face the consequences of his choices."" Mr Maughan praised the bravery of his victims who had come forward with information, who had been a ""big part of securing this outcome"". He urged members of the public to ""take a step back"", adding ""if it sounds too good to be true it probably is"". ""People like Henderson are looking to exploit trusting people who have saved and worked hard,"" he said. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Eurovision 2023: Final batch of ticket sell in an hour," The majority of a final batch of tickets for next month's Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool have sold out, the BBC has confirmed. A ""limited number"" of tickets for three live shows and six production previews went on sale at 12:00 BST. Just over an hour later, the BBC said only a small number remained available. These are mostly single seats and hospitality packages for previews and rehearsals. Both of the semi-finals and the grand final are now sold out. In March the initial batch of tickets was snapped up in 90 minutes, leaving thousands of fans disappointed. On Monday, many waited again in an online queue, hoping to get their hands on the last remaining tickets. In a post on Twitter at 13:25 BST, BBC Eurovision said: ""The majority of Eurovision 2023 tickets that went on sale today have now been sold. ""A small number of tickets are still available to purchase for some shows. ""For those of you with tickets, we'll see you in Liverpool. And to everyone else, we'll see you on BBC One!"" It will be the first time the has UK hosted the annual competition in 25 years. About 6,000 fans will be inside the arena for each of the shows. Prices ranged from £90 to £290 for the live semi-finals and from £160 to £380 for the live grand final. Preview shows ranged from £30 to £280. A preview show is a full run-through of the TV broadcast that doubles up as a production rehearsal, with all the acts performing live in the arena. There are six preview shows and three live shows. All competing broadcasters pay a fee to take part in Eurovision (see below for more details); but with only 26 slots available in the grand final, there has to be a knock-out stage. That takes the form of two-semi finals, which this year take place on Tuesday 9 and Thursday 11 May. Ten songs from each of the two qualifying rounds go through to the final. A handful of countries, known as the big five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK), automatically get a place in the final because they contribute more money to the staging of the contest. Last year's winner also qualifies without participating in the semi-finals. This year, that honour goes to Ukraine. The city of Liverpool has announced multiple events around this year's Eurovision Song Contest. There will be a two-week festival taking place, including a submarine parade and a rave which will take place simultaneously in Kyiv. Close to the M&S Bank Arena will be the Eurovision village, the official fan zone of the contest for thousands of people. During the televised live shows, fans will be able to watch both semi-finals and the final (which is ticketed) on big screens there. It is also where some of the acts will perform on stage across the week. There will also be extensive coverage across the BBC. The UK government has put forward £10m towards the cost of hosting the song contest for things like security and visa arrangements. It says the vast majority will be spent on ""showcasing Ukrainian culture"" but would not give further details. In comparison, the Italian government did not pay anything towards the event last year. Local authorities in Liverpool have also pledged £4m for the event, which is £6m less than officials put forward in Turin in 2022. The bulk of the cost will fall to the BBC which is expected to put forward between £8m and £17m as host broadcaster. The 37 broadcasters taking part all pay a fee to enter, which in recent years has totalled a combined sum of about £5m. The BBC does not make its contribution public. All the build-up, insights and analysis is explored each week on a BBC podcast called Eurovisioncast. Eurovisioncast is available on BBC Sounds, or search wherever you get your podcasts from.

Eurovision 2023: When is it and who is representing the UK?," The countdown has begun for this year's Eurovision song contest, which will be broadcast live from Liverpool in May. The UK is staging the contest on behalf of 2022 winners Ukraine. The Eurovision final will take place at the M&S Bank Arena on the waterfront in Liverpool on Saturday 13 May. It will be the first Eurovision Song Contest to be held in the UK for 25 years. The competition is made up of two semi-finals and the grand final - all of which will be broadcast live. This year's semi-finals will take place on Tuesday 9 May and Thursday 11 May, with ten countries from each show going through to the final. In addition, the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany are already guaranteed a spot, along with last year's winners, Ukraine. This means 26 countries will compete in the final. Mae Muller will represent the UK with her track I Wrote A Song, the country's first female Eurovision entrant for five years. She was born in 1997 - the year the UK last won Eurovision - and has previously supported Little Mix on tour. As in recent years, there was no televised national selection show. Instead, the BBC chose the winner in consultation with a management company. All of the other participating countries have revealed their songs and acts. When tickets for all of the Eurovision shows went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Tuesday 7 March they sold out. A final batch were released at 12:00 BST on Monday, 24 April. As well as the three televised live shows - the semi-finals and the final - there are six preview shows which double as dress rehearsals. Prices ranged from £90 to £290 for the live semi-final shows, and from £160 to £380 for the live grand final. Preview show tickets cost between £30 and £280. About 3,000 tickets are being made available to Ukrainians living in the UK. More than 160 million people around the world are expected to watch the 2023 final. In the UK, Eurovision will be broadcast live on BBC One. The BBC's coverage will be hosted by Graham Norton, Hannah Waddingham, Alesha Dixon and Ukrainian singer Julia Sanina. In addition, a special fan zone will accommodate up to 25,000 people at Liverpool's Pier Head, close to the arena. Events planned include a submarine parade through the city and a rave which will take place simultaneously in Liverpool and Kyiv. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won the 2022 Eurovision song contest with their song Stefania. Normally, the winning country hosts the following year's competition, but the ongoing war in Ukraine makes this impossible. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the contest, invited the UK to host on Ukraine's behalf because UK contestant Sam Ryder was the runner up in the 2022 show. It will be the ninth time the UK has hosted the competition, and the fifth time it has done so on behalf of another country. Broadcasters from the 37 countries taking part each pay an entrance fee to the EBU. In recent years these fees have totalled about £5m. The BBC does not make its contribution public. Russia was expelled from the competition following its invasion of Ukraine. BBC News has been told countries have been asked to pay more to make up for its loss. Three countries have said they will not take part as a result of the increase. Some broadcasters are also thought to be worried about the additional costs of transporting equipment to the UK now it is no longer a member of the EU. Staging the event is expected to cost the BBC between £8m and £17m. The UK government has pledged £10m towards operational costs, while local authorities in Liverpool have committed £4m. The semi-finals are decided by a public vote, but the final is more complicated. Each of the 26 countries has a jury whose members rank all the final performances. They award a fixed number of points to their top 10 acts: Respectively 12 points, 10 points, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two and one. The jury results are announced by each country in turn on the night. Competing countries then award points to the other contestants based on viewer votes, following the same scoring system. For the first time, in 2023 public votes from outside Europe will play a part.  Worldwide votes will be combined and counted as if they are another country. Eurovision has long been popular in Australia, and in 2015 it was invited to send an act as part of the contest's 60th anniversary celebrations. It has been allowed to take part ever since. Like European countries, it pays a fee to the EBU to help fund the event. However, Australia is barred from hosting. If it ever won, it would have to nominate a European nation to stage the contest on its behalf. Other non-European countries, including Israel, are also allowed participate because they are members of the EBU.

Len Goodman: Tributes pour in for the 'class act' from Strictly and Dancing with the Stars," Len Goodman has been remembered as a ""kind and brilliant"" man who ""lit up the screen"", following his death at the age of 78 due to bone cancer. Friends and co-stars all paid tribute to the former dancer, who became head judge on Strictly Come Dancing and its US counterpart Dancing With The Stars. Strictly presenter Claudia Winkleman called Goodman ""a class act"" who was full of ""twinkle, warmth and wit"". Respects were also paid by the British Royal family and UK government. Former Strictly judge Dame Darcey Bussell said: ""He had the gift of the gab, and I will never forget his use of fruit and veg and sticky toffee pudding as descriptive phrases of dance. ""He was always professional: grounded, funny, loveable, supportive and respectful… but never shy to say how it was. ""For Len, Strictly and Dancing with the Stars was never about the fame, it was about keeping his world of dance true and relevant. As I go in to coach at the Royal Ballet today, I think of him so fondly and try to follow his example."" A former welder, Goodman became a dancer on the advice of his doctor and never looked back. After winning the British Championships in his 20s, he became a dance instructor and joined Strictly for its launch in 2004. Popular with viewers for his wry humour and avuncular critiques, he managed to turn the act of giving scores into a source of catchphrases: From his comedically elongated pronunciation of ""seveeeen"" to the much sought-after ""10 from Len"". Strictly's longest-serving judge, Craig Revel Horwood, referenced that showmanship while paying tribute on Monday, describing Goodman as a ""gorgeous colleague and dear friend"". ""Len Goody Goodman is what I always called him and 'It's a ten from Len & seveeeeern' will live with me forever,"" he added. Winkleman told BBC News: ""There was nobody like him because he was so humble. ""He was adorable - on camera, off camera, and to everybody who took part."" Her co-host Tess Daly agreed that Goodman was ""a beautiful man, genuine, warm and humble, who left an impression on everyone he met"". ""I'll never forget the fun we had on set, his love and passion for dancing and that wonderfully cheeky smile lit up the screen,"" she said on social media. Bruno Tonioli shared a picture of him and Goodman together, declaring: ""There will never be anyone like you. You will always be my perfect 10."" Current head judge Shirley Ballas said that her ""past teacher"" was a ""dance legend"" and ""a true gentleman"" as well as a ""shining star in the ballroom that everyone loved."" Anton Du Beke, who was a dancer and judge on the popular celebrity dancing show, recalled having first met Goodman when he was just a young lad, as he was his dance judge. ""Len was different to anyone else in the dancing business - he was a wonderful character, he had a roguishness about him - he had twinkle,"" he said in a statement online. ""He had a way about him that you really wanted him to like you. If Len liked you, it was more important than anyone else liking you."" He went on to call his old friend ""a national treasure"". Current judge Motsi Mabuse posted a black-and-white picture of Goodman on her Instagram story, alongside the letters ""R.I.P."" Her sister, the dancer Oti Mabuse, added: ""My heart breaks. You will forever be missed. Thank you for your honesty, integrity and a pleasurable presence."" Former Strictly contestant Susanna Reid said the news of Goodman's death was ""such an awful shock and so sad"". ""Len was an absolute legend and the definition of a proper gent. He was a beautiful man with a huge sense of humour who had such a mischievous turn of phrase."" She said she would never forget the time he described her Samba as being ""all bounce, bum and bongos"". Camilla, the Queen Consort, who danced with Goodman at a public engagement in 2019, was ""saddened to hear the news"", according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described Goodman as ""a great entertainer, a popular face on TV screens up and down the country"". ""He will be missed by many and our condolences go to his friends and family,"" he added. :: ""You floated across that floor like butter on a crumpet."" :: ""It was like watching a stork who'd been struck by lightning."" :: ""You were like a chess master - you plotted your way around that floor. That was a mango of a tango. Delicious."" :: ""For me, you can't waft enough."" Goodman made his final appearance on Strictly during the 2016 Christmas Day special. He also served as head judge on Dancing With The Stars for more than 15 years, announcing his retirement in November last year saying he wanted to ""spend more time with my grandchildren and family"" in the UK. He died on Saturday at a hospice in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, having had cancer, surrounded by his family. A statement from his manager, Jackie Gill, on Monday described him as ""a much loved husband, father and grandfather who will be sorely missed by family, friends and all who knew him."" He leaves his wife Sue Barrett, who he married in 2012, and his son, James, from a previous relationship.

"Dale Meeks: Ant and Dec lead tributes to Emmerdale and Byker Grove star, who has died aged 48"," TV presenters Ant and Dec have led tributes to their former Byker Grove co-star Dale Meeks, who has died at the age of 48. The actor starred in the BBC teen drama as Greg, leader of Denton Burn, the rivals to the Byker Grove youth club. But he was best known for playing Simon Meredith in the ITV soap Emmerdale between 2003 and 2006. He died from heart failure on Saturday evening at South Tyneside hospital, his brother Philip Meeks told PA news. ""My heart is broken,"" he said, confirming his brother had been due to turn 49 next month. Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly, who portrayed PJ and Duncan in Byker Grove at the start of their careers, tweeted on Sunday: ""We are so incredibly sorry to hear the very sad news of Dale's passing. ""He was the loveliest of guys, even though he was a Denton 'Burner', the arch nemesis of the Byker 'Grovers'!"" They added: ""A sad loss at such a young age. RIP Dale. Sleep well bonny lad."" Responding to the tribute from the celebrity duo, his brother told the news agency: ""That's absolutely lovely. ""I sort of remember meeting them as kids myself. He [Dale] was in Byker Grove, He made one of them blind, not in real life."" Born in South Shields, Meeks was a star of both screen and stage, performing in The Producers, Chicago and A Christmas Carol, as well as a West End production of Love Never Dies. In Emmerdale, his character, the friendly fishmonger Simon was romantically linked to Nicola King (played by Nicola Wheeler) but left the fictional Yorkshire village to start a new live in Costa Rica. Meeks was also a singer, winning ITV's Stars in Their Eyes Celebrity Special, alongside fellow Emmerdale actor Mark Charnock as the Blues Brothers. His last TV appearance came in a small role in ITV's The Hunt For Raoul Moat last week. News of his death was first confirmed by a family member on Facebook on Sunday. ""So unbelievably sad,"" the post read. ""Brother-in-law, mucca, side kick and just the BEST friend a lad could have wished for. RIP Dale Meeks. So much less to laugh about now you're not there to share it with."" ""Thanks everyone for all the beautiful messages and memories you have been sharing,"" it continued. ""The support of Dale's friends has been so incredibly strong over these chaotic, heart-breaking final hours, I can only stand in awe."" Meeks' other credits include roles in Casualty, Inspector George Gently and the Tracey Beaker spin-off The Dumping Ground. His fellow actor Nick Miles, who plays Jimmy King in Emmerdale, added his tribute, tweeting: ""Such sad news. He was a lovely generous man. RIP."" Ex-Coronation Street actor and Family Fortunes presenter Les Dennis, who performed with Meeks in pantomime at the Sunderland Empire, posted his condolences, adding: ""He was great company and so talented. Thoughts with his family and friends."" The theatre posted its own tribute to the actor, tweeting: ""Dale has performed on our stage a number of times, but most memorably for us he starred in Cinderella back in 2007, our centenary year. Our thoughts are with his friends and family."" ",532,entertainment,2023-04-24T14:47:52.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65371532
Len Goodman: Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing with the Stars judge dies at 78," Former Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman has died at the age of 78. He died on Saturday at a hospice in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, surrounded by his family. He had had bone cancer. Tributes have poured in from the likes of Strictly co-host Claudia Winkleman, who called Goodman ""a class act"", as well as former judges Dame Darcey Bussell and Bruno Tonioli. Besides Strictly, Goodman also appeared on the US version of the show, Dancing with the Stars from 2005 until 2022. A former dancer himself, he featured on Strictly from its launch in 2004 until 2016 and proved popular with viewers for his wry humour and avuncular critiques. His enthusiastic delivery when awarding a score of seven points effectively turned the number into his catchphrase, along with ""it's a 10 from Len"" for those even more deserving contestants on the popular celebrity dancing show. Strictly's longest-serving judge, Craig Revel Horwood, referenced that showmanship while paying tribute on Monday, describing Goodman as a ""gorgeous colleague and dear friend"". ""Len Goody Goodman is what I always called him and 'It's a ten from Len & seveeeeern' will live with me forever,"" he added. Winkleman told BBC News: ""There was nobody like him because he was so humble. ""He was adorable - on camera, off camera, and to everybody who took part.""

""I'll never forget the fun we had on set, his love and passion for dancing and that wonderfully cheeky smile lit up the screen,"" she posted on social media. ""You were never a 7 for me, Len you were always a 10."" Tonioli shared a picture of him and Goodman together, declaring: ""There will never be anyone like you. You will always be my perfect 10."" Shirley Ballas said that her ""past teacher"" was a ""dance legend"" and ""a true gentleman"" as well as a ""shining star in the ballroom that everyone loved."" Dame Darcey, meanwhile, noted how Goodman ""gave me such support on my time at Strictly and I feel incredibly lucky to have worked with such a professional, funny and loveable man"". Former Strictly contestant Susanna Reid said the news of Goodman's death was ""such an awful shock and so sad"". ""Len was an absolute legend and the definition of a proper gent. He was a beautiful man with a huge sense of humour who had such a mischievous turn of phrase."" She said she would never forget the time he described her Samba as being ""all bounce, bum and bongos"". :: ""You floated across that floor like butter on a crumpet."" :: ""It was like watching a stork who'd been struck by lightning."" :: ""You were like a chess master - you plotted your way around that floor.

Camilla, the Queen Consort, was ""saddened to hear the news"", according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described Goodman as ""a great entertainer, a popular face on TV screens up and down the country"". ""He will be missed by many and our condolences go to his friends and family,"" he added. Goodman grew up in east London and began dancing at 19, after a doctor told him it would be good exercise for his injured foot. The one-time welder went on to win the British Championships in his late 20s, after which he retired to become a teacher and choreographer, opening his own dance school, the Goodman Academy in Dartford, Kent. He was the head judge on Strictly Come Dancing from its inception, and made his final appearance on the 2016 Christmas Day special. ""When I was first asked to do the programme I wasn't sure, because I thought it might be a bit of a mickey-take,"" he once told the Guardian. ""But I'm so glad I did it, because it's dispelled the preconception about what dance classes or schools are like. ""The programme has changed things in dancing schools like you can't imagine. Everyone has had huge influxes of people coming to dance. It's absolutely brilliant."" Goodman also served as head judge on Dancing With The Stars for more than 15 years, announcing his retirement in November last year saying he wanted to ""spend more time with my grandchildren and family"" in the UK. A keen Music enthusiast, he was also a regular stand-in for the late Paul O'Grady on his BBC Radio 2 show. BBC director general Tim Davie was among those paying tribute, saying he was ""a wonderful, warm entertainer who was adored by millions"". ""He appealed to all ages and felt like a member of everyone's family,"" he said. ""Len was at the very heart of Strictly's success. He will be hugely missed by the public and his many friends and family."" Goodman, who was a recipient of the Carl Alan Award in recognition of outstanding contributions to dance, also had a love of cricket and West Ham United Football Club. A statement from his manager, Jackie Gill, on Monday described him as ""a much loved husband, father and grandfather who will be sorely missed by family, friends and all who knew him.""

First edition Shakespeare text from 1623 goes on display," A First Folio edition of William Shakespeare's plays that was published in 1623 is being put on display. Guildhall Library will be showcasing the rare book as part of a celebration of 400 years since the book was published. Published seven years after the Bard's death, the book contains all of his plays. Another folio edition and two smaller original copies of Henry IV Part One and Othello will also be on display. Principal librarian of Guildhall Library, Peter Ross, told the BBC: ""There were around 750 copies of the first edition printed and around 235 survive today. ""Only a quarter of those copies are complete and amongst the best in the world is this one. ""It's remarkable for its completeness and quality of paper."" He added that while the copy would remain in the library, ""another copy of the first folio sold for around $10m (£8m) in October 2020"". The folio edition was compiled by actors John Heminge and Henry Condell as a tribute and memorial to the writer. Experts say that had his two friends not gathered his plays for the First Folio, half of them, including Macbeth, Twelfth Night and The Tempest, would have been lost forever. The City Corporation's copy was purchased in about 1760 by William Petty Fitzmaurice, who became prime minister, after which it was bought by the London Institution at the sale of his library in 1806. The book was transferred to Guildhall Library in 1913, and is rarely featured on display because of its delicate nature. Chair of the City of London Corporation's Culture, Heritage, and Libraries Committee, Wendy Hyde, said: ""I think it's very inspiring for Londoners to appreciate their fantastic history. ""The First Folio is a truly remarkable book and for five precious hours, everyone will be given the rare opportunity to see it up close at Guildhall Library, as part of our 'First Folio 400' celebrations."" The books will be on display, along with educational talks, between 10:30 and 15:30 BST on Monday. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Salvador Dali statues to headline Shrewsbury arts festival," Three sculptures by the world-famous surrealist artist Salvador Dali will be coming to Shrewsbury this summer as part of its annual Art Trail. It is thought to be the first time the artworks have been shown in the UK. They go on display from 1 July. The pieces include Surrealist Piano, Homage to Terpsichore and Dalian Dancer and will be unveiled at venues across the town. The works of Jacob Chandler, Banksy, LS Lowry, Damien Hirst, Michael James Talbot and Man Ray will also feature in the eight-week arts festival. This year's event has the theme of movement to mark 350 years since the birth of Shrewsbury's John Weaver, the father of English ballet and pantomime. Works from 200 local and regional creatives will sit alongside pieces by the renowned international artists. The Shrewsbury Art Trail was created by Jess Richards who was inspired to boost positivity in the town as it emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns. ""I wanted something big and impactful,"" she said. ""It's about inspiring local artists and showing that art is for everyone."" The five-metre-tall Surrealist Piano will be displayed outside Shrewsbury Castle while the Homage to Terpsichore sculpture, which depicts the Greek muse of dance and chorus, will be placed in the courtyard at Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery. A series of 16 exhibitions, eight workshops and five events will be staged at multiple venues including the Darwin shopping centre and the Severn Theatre, plus cafes, art galleries, churches and parks. Other events planned include a John Weaver theatre and dance festival, a glass festival at  St Mary's Church, a family treasure trail, a 'Secret Art Sale' at local art dealer's the Soden Collection and a dance photography exhibition.

Liverpool's public transport sports Eurovision design," Public transport across Liverpool will sport new designs to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest. Liveried buses and trams - including new zero-emission hydrogen buses - will be hitting the Liverpool City Region's roads and rails. The buses will initially be used for driver training before entering passenger service. Eurovision artwork will also appear at train and bus stations, bus stops, ferry terminals and tunnel entrances. The contest coming to the city has been made possible with the help of £2m of funding from Mayor Steve Rotheram and the Combined Authority. Mr Rotheram said: ""We want to use the contest as a chance to showcase what makes our region fantastic - so that visitors and investors alike return time and time again. ""I'm enormously proud of the investments we've made to deliver a publicly-owned, public transport network run in the interests of the public. ""We've commissioned these new liveries to celebrate this global spectacular coming to our region."" Liverpool is hosting the competition on behalf of war-torn Ukraine next month. The contest is being held in the city after last year's UK entrant Sam Ryder finished runner-up to Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra. As Russia's invasion of Ukraine prevented the winning country from hosting the 2023 contest, organisers instead said the UK would stage the show on their behalf.

How a south of Scotland town influenced a rising rap star," A rising star of rap has said he owes a slice of his success to a south of Scotland town. Born in Nigeria, Bemz spent his early years in London but moved to Stranraer as a teenager. Now based in Glasgow, he recently released an EP - Nova's Dad - and is playing at the city's SWG3 later this month. He told BBC Scotland's The Edit that his years in Galloway had played a part in making him the artist he is today. Bemz was BBC Radio Scotland's Scottish Act of the Year last year and has played at the TRNSMT festival and toured with The Snuts. The hip-hop artist said his years in Dumfries and Galloway had been important to his development. ""The first thing I guess Stranraer really played a part in for me, especially as a musician, is it gave me time to make all my mistakes,"" he said. ""If you heard the music I was making back then - it's embarrassing. ""It's so bad that I've essentially like just wiped everything off."" However, he said the town had remained a part of the work he was producing now. ""Stranraer played a lot into the type of person I am today - which obviously that influences how I write,"" he said. Bemz said he spent a lot of his time in the town playing rugby, but had since had ""too many takeaways"" to go back to the sport. He said that becoming a father recently had also influenced his music. ""Now I've got a daughter, so it's like, right, what do I want my daughter to know about her dad?"" he said. ""I talk about my mental well-being over the last two years, with the highs and lows of becoming a dad and becoming a musician as well."" He said he could not believe he had a show coming up in front of a big crowd in Glasgow. ""From being that boy in Stranraer, I never thought I would be in a position where I'm playing a headline show to 500 people,"" he said. ""It is going to be good, I am really, really looking forward to it - but the nerves are there though."" ",368,uk,2023-04-24T11:40:35.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-65373495
Friends star Matthew Perry to pull Keanu Reeves jibe from memoir," Friends actor Matthew Perry has pledged to remove ""mean"" references to Keanu Reeves from future copies of his autobiography. The star, who played Chandler Bing in the US sitcom, made repeated references to the star in his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. On two occasions, he asked why Reeves ""still walks among us"" while ""talented"" actors like River Phoenix had died. ""I said a stupid thing. It was a mean thing to do,"" Perry admitted. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, he added: ""I pulled his name because I live on the same street. I've apologised publicly to him. ""Any future versions of the book will not have his name in it."" He said he had not made amends in person but, ""if I run into the guy I'll apologise. ""It was just stupid,"" he added. Published last year, Perry's memoir recounted his career-long struggle with substance abuse and addiction. In it, he describes Phoenix, his co-star in the 1988 film A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon as a genius who was ""way ahead"" of his time. ""River was a beautiful man, inside and out - too beautiful for this world, it turned out. It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down. ""Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?"" Phoenix died in 1993, aged 23, after an overdose of cocaine and heroin. Heath Ledger died from an accidental overdose of prescription medication in 2008. Perry has already apologised for the jibe about Reeves, saying he picked the John Wick actor's name at random and was a ""big fan"". ""I apologise. I should have used my name instead,"" he said in a statement to People. in October. ",302,entertainment,2023-04-24T11:11:03.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65372635

Len Goodman obituary: From the East End to Strictly Come Dancing studio," In April 2004, the BBC took a huge gamble. Desperate to find a new show with mass appeal, it had come up with a seemingly bizarre solution. Ballroom dancing was deeply unfashionable. The quickstep and jive hailed from an era of Brylcreem and Butlin's holidays. Now, the corporation was attempting to make the nostalgic preserve of a few elderly enthusiasts the centrepiece of its Saturday nights. Just days before the first show, the producers hit a crisis. Four judges had been offered contracts: Craig Revel Horwood, Arlene Phillips, Bruno Tonioli, and a well-known figure from the world of dance. At the very last moment, the fourth judge dropped out. The BBC was at a loss. Dozens of former world champions - giants of their profession - had already been interviewed, but none had been right. The show's professional dancers were asked if any luminaries had been missed. Erin Boag, the former New Zealand champion, tentatively offered a suggestion. ""Have you tried Len Goodman?"" she asked. ""He's just a dance teacher from Dartford, but he's a bit of a character."" Leonard Gordon Goodman was born in Farnborough, Kent, on 25 April 1944. He grew up in London's East End in an over-crowded two-up, two-down terrace. There was ""lots of love and laughter, but very little money"", he recalled. It was a tough neighbourhood. Two of his uncles had been active members of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists before World War Two. When hostilities broke out, angry crowds attacked the family home in Howard Street. Serious injuries were only prevented when the sound of an air raid siren dispersed the mob. The family scraped a living selling vegetables from barrows. Goodman's grandfather Albert pawned his gold watch every Monday morning to buy the week's supply. Len watched the old man attract customers with a smooth patter dotted with earthy phrases. He later used many of his grandad's lines on Strictly Come Dancing. Albert Goodman was good at his job. The barrow became two shops in Bethnal Green - with enough money left over to buy Len's parents a greengrocer business in Kent. Soon after they moved, the marriage fell apart. Goodman's father moved away, and his mother buried the shame of divorce by throwing herself into her job. At school, young Len enjoyed football and cricket - but was no academic. ""It's obvious you're never going to amount to anything, Goodman,"" his headmaster declared. ""You're a failure in class. You'll be a failure in life."" To help his mother, he pushed a barrow of vegetables around town every evening - just as his grandfather had. This, Goodman believed, was a more valuable education than school had ever provided - as it taught him how to speak to people and engage them. At the age of 14, he went to his first dance class. He had little love for the foxtrot, but a keen interest in girls. The most thrilling moment of the night, he later wrote, was the 'excuse me' dance - during which you had to kiss your partner goodbye. A year later, Goodman left school ""with no sense of loss on either side"". He began an apprenticeship in an engineering factory but, by his own admission, was dreadful at it. He took a welding course and found work in the Harland and Wolff Royal docks in Woolwich. It wasn't a job he liked, but it brought in enough money to enjoy himself at weekends. Goodman became a sharp-dressed Mod, hanging out on his Vespa in Brighton on Saturday afternoons, trying to avoid fisticuffs with gangs of rival Rockers. Like many of his generation, he worshipped rock 'n' roll and regarded ballroom dancing as something 'old fogeys' did. Then, he broke his metatarsal playing football on Hackney Marshes, and was advised to find an activity to help build its strength again. Joy Tolhurst was a former world champion. At her first dance lesson, Goodman was hampered by wearing a winklepicker on one foot and a carpet slipper on the other. Slowly, he fell in love with the both the waltz and Mrs Tolhurst's daughter. He and Cherry Tolhurst became partners on and off the floor. Their first competition was a Pontin's sponsored event at the Royal Albert Hall. Goodman practiced in his front room, with a lamp placed behind him - so he could see his hip action in the shadows. As the couple sashayed onto the hallowed stage, Goodman heard great bellows from the audience. Fifty-three fellow dock workers had hired a coach to come and support him, and were well lubricated up. When Joy's husband died suddenly, she asked 22-year-old Len to help her teach. Learning from an ex-welder was a shock to students used to a poised former professional. By 1973, Goodman and Cherry were driving thousands of miles a year, demonstrating the cha-cha-cha and rumba to amateur classes the length and breadth of the country. They married and opened their own dance school in Dartford. The couple won a rising star competition in Blackpool - but decided not to compete professionally again. ""I got fed up with the politics of the business,"" explained Goodman. ""The fact that you had to placate and schmooze people that you didn't really like, because you did not upset them, as they were judges."" The decision took a toll on his marriage which, he admitted, had become more of a dance partnership than a relationship. When the dancing stopped, everything collapsed. Cherry left him for a multi-millionaire Frenchman, leaving Len in an empty house and with only half a business. His heartstrings were healed when he met Lesley, a former wife of the manager of Black Sabbath. A year later, the couple had a son. What saved his business was the film Saturday Night Fever. Goodman put up posters: ""You've heard the music, now learn the dances."" There were queues halfway down Dartford High Street and, when Grease came out, ""the seam of gold turned into a whole goldmine"". By the time the BBC rang to suggest he audition for Strictly Come Dancing, Goodman was about to turn 60. He was settled with his new partner Sue, and their dance school was performing well. In truth, he wasn't looking for new challenges. He was hoping to wind down his business and play a little golf. But his competitive instincts kicked in, so Goodman caught the bus to Strictly's studios, wearing his best tweed suit. Revel Horwood, Phillips and Tonioli all had backgrounds in theatre, but none knew ballroom. Len was concerned that the show might ""take the rise"" out of the discipline he loved - which could destroy his reputation. To take part, he had to break a contract to judge the Blackpool championships - which clashed with the first TV show. It wasn't just the BBC that was taking a gigantic risk: Goodman knew he would never be asked again. He decided the best thing was just to be himself. In the first show, he trotted out one of his grandad's favourite phrases, ""all sausage, and no sizzle"", and quickly settled in. The audience loved his pithy observations. ""It's a lovely rise and fall, up and down like a bride's nightie,"" he told one nervous contestant. ""You're just like a trifle - fruity at the top but a little bit spongy down below,"" he informed another. At heart, he was a teacher and was quick to offer practical advice. But one of the show's first brave celebrities, Jason Wood, discovered Goodman had a sharp tongue. ""Wood by name, wood by nature,"" he said. With millions watching, the Americans picked up the show. ABC booked Tonioli to appear alongside two US judges on the rebranded Dancing with the Stars - only for history to repeat itself. One of ABC's picks did not perform well in the pilot programme. With 24 hour's notice, Goodman was put on a plane to Los Angeles. For more than a decade, he crossed the Atlantic twice a week - appearing as head judge on both shows simultaneously. While in LA, he shared an apartment complex with Tonioli - with Bruno doing the cooking and Len the ironing. Goodman's natural charm worked so well on camera that he was offered other presenting opportunities. There was even a short-lived BBC game show, Partners in Rhyme. But, in his 70s, he decided the constant flying back and forth had become too much. He left Strictly Come Dancing - with much emotion - in 2016 to concentrate on the (much better paid) ABC version. Then in 2022, he left the US show to ""spend more time with my grandchildren and family"" in the UK. International fame came late to Len Goodman. When it did, he had spent long enough in obscurity for it not to affect him. He may never have been a world-class dancer himself, but his easy-going charm made him a natural TV performer.

Maleficent: Dragon catches fire during Disneyland show," Crowds enjoying a live performance at Disneyland in California were left stunned on Saturday night when a giant animatronic dragon caught fire. Videos online show Maleficent, the 45ft (13m) fire-breathing dragon, quickly being engulfed in flames, as firefighters try to control the blaze. It happened during Fantasmic, a live performance featuring gravity-defying water displays, pyrotechnics and Mickey Mouse (usually) saving the day. No-one was injured in the fire. At one stage, a large explosion of fire shoots out of the dragon, as the crowd can be heard gasping and Disney staff yell out to ""clear the area"". Due to the thick smoke, park patrons were evacuated from several nearby attractions, Disney said in a statement. It added that the cause of the fire remains under investigation, and for now, any similar fire effects will be suspended at all of its theme parks around the world ""out of an abundance of caution"". This is not the first time Maleficent has misbehaved - sitting on a float during a parade, her head caught fire in 2018 at Disney World in Florida. Maleficent is the main villain in Sleeping Beauty, and turns from ""the mistress of all evil"" to a dragon to fight Prince Phillip in Disney's 1959 film. She was reimagined for a live-action film in 2014, and portrayed by Angelina Jolie. ",220,world,2023-04-23T22:52:08.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65370042
Man to make 31st trip to Ukraine to deliver supplies," A man is preparing to make his 31st trip to Ukraine to deliver supplies donated by the people of Thanet, Kent. Kevin Mark Cromeeke, a self-employed builder and café owner in Ramsgate, delivers food, generators and medical supplies to civilians and the military on the frontline. He said he would continue to drive his van to Ukraine “until the end” of the war. Soon to set off on his 31st trip since the Russian invasion, the 59-year-old is calling on locals to give what they can. “I’m quite happy to finance my own trips and fuel, I’ve bought all the generators myself – but what I don’t have enough money for is to then buy all the hygiene, sanitary items and food I need to take with me,” he said. The father-of two, whose first trip to Ukraine lasted three and a half months, said he will continue to deliver items until the war is over. “The government is giving tanks and guns and things, but half of my nappies are used as absorbents in soldiers boots to stop trench foot,” he said. “It is intense. But I’m not in the same poor position they are and that’s what gives me the strength to carry on.” While Mr Cromeeke is in Ukraine, his business is run by colleague Matt Evans. “This fuels Kev,"" Mr Evans said. ""He’s been out collecting for months now. He’s collected half a dozen generators, food, aid – all to help the Ukrainian people, which is a fantastic thing to do.” “I’m very proud of him.” Public donations can be made to Topps Café in Harbour Parade.

Nikolai Peskov: Putin spokesman's son 'joined Wagner in Ukraine'," The 33-year-old son of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says he served with the notorious Wagner mercenary group in Ukraine for nearly six months. Nikolai Peskov said ""it was my duty... I couldn't sit to one side watching as friends and others went off there."" His father confirmed this - but refused to provide any more details, Russia's RBK website said. But a number of social media users in Russia cast doubt on whether Nikolai Peskov actually fought in the war. The BBC was unable to verify Nikolai Peskov's claim about serving with Wagner, whose troops have been engaged in intense fighting for months in Ukraine's eastern town of Bakhmut. Wagner is called a ""private military company"" in Russia and now has international notoriety for alleged war crimes and other abuses in Ukraine. It has recruited thousands of convicts from prisons after taking heavy losses. It is rare for a member of the Russian elite to choose to join the group - many have gone abroad to avoid conscription into the regular army. Nikolai Peskov is also known as Nikolai Choles, and speaks fluent English, having spent several years as a youth in London. He has worked as a correspondent for Russian state broadcaster RT. Both he and his father are under US sanctions. In an interview with the pro-Kremlin daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, he said it was his own decision to join Wagner, but he did not know how to do it, ""so I had to turn to my dad... and he helped me with that"". He said he used a false ID so that his Wagner comrades would not learn of his Kremlin connections. He did not reveal that assumed name in the interview because, he said, he might need to use it again. Nikolai Peskov's claim coincides with a major new army recruitment drive, with Russian state ads urging men to do their ""patriotic duty"" in the Ukraine war. Tens of thousands of men fled Russia last September to avoid being conscripted, after President Vladimir Putin announced a ""partial mobilisation"". Nikolai Peskov did not reveal where exactly he had served in what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. In comments to the Russian media, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin did however give more details. After joining the group with fake documents, he said, Mr Peskov's son underwent a three-week training course. ""After that, when he left for Luhansk, it was necessary to expand the combined artillery battalion, and he was sent to join an Uragan [multiple rocket launcher] crew,"" Mr Prigozhin said, adding that he ""showed courage and heroism, just like all the others"". According to Mr Prigozhin, Dmitry Peskov had asked him to ""take [Nikolai] on as a simple artilleryman"". Nikolai Peskov said he received a medal for bravery this year after ""all of my team accomplished a feat... We had one interesting sortie - I can't say more than that."" On Monday, Dmitry Peskov was quoted by RBK as saying that his son indeed ""took part in the special military operation"" - the term used by Moscow to describe President Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022. He added that he did not want to say anything else on the issue, as ""it has nothing to do with my work"". But some in Russia are openly questioning whether he actually fought in Ukraine. The VChK-OGPU Telegram channel is quoting eyewitnesses as saying Nikolai Peskov's favourite Tesla car, which he usually drives himself, was seen ""actively"" moving around Moscow - and even collecting fines - during the period which he claimed to have served in Wagner. The channel also says that unnamed Wagner artillerists have told it he was nowhere to be seen in the Bakhmut area. Last September, Nikolai Peskov was targeted by a prank live on YouTube, in which he appeared reluctant to join the army. Journalist Dmitry Nizovtsev, an associate of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, posed as a military recruitment officer in a phone call to Nikolai Peskov. Speaking in an aggressive tone, Nizovtsev asked him why he had not shown up at a Moscow call-up centre. Nikolai replied nervously, reminding Nizovtsev that ""I am Mr Peskov"". ""I'm going to take this matter to another level,"" he said. ""I basically need to know what's going on and what my rights are."" Mr Prigozhin and some Russian military bloggers have been very critical of Russian generals in Ukraine, accusing them of blunders and under-equipping Wagner. Mr Prigozhin also accused military officials of not recognising his group's sacrifices. But last month President Putin outlawed public criticism of Wagner or the regular armed forces. The penalties for ""discrediting"" any part of the Russian military include prison terms of up to seven years. ",789,world,2023-04-24T12:30:12.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65370222
Ukrainian woman living on Tyneside fundraising for prosthetic limbs," A woman who fled the Ukraine war is raising funds to provide prosthetic limbs for those hurt in the conflict. Iryna Orshak is working with charity the Dopomogator Foundation, to raise the cash. After the war broke out, she left Lviv with her youngest daughter, but her husband and daughter, 21, who is studying at university, remain at home. Now settled in Whitley Bay, the 41-year-old said: ""This war has seen more than 3,000 Ukrainians [lose limbs]."" ""A lot of people have had to have operations to remove injured limbs - women, men and children and it's hard for them to travel out of the country for prosthetics because of the cost,"" she explained. The foundation, which started in 2017, has concentrated on helping the Ukrainian army and hospitals since the conflict broke out in February 2022. Since the start of 2023 it has committed to raising about £1.2m ($1.5m) for Ukrainian firm Allbionics to produce bionic prosthetics and subsequent rehabilitation for it's residents and servicemen and women free of charge. Allbionics, based in Kyiv and Poland, started making 3D-scanned bionic hand prostheses, which have sensors providing precise control for users, last September. Volodymyr Bandura, from the firm, said: ""We have a candidate who was a war medic whose position was shot at during a night raid. ""He was badly wounded and lost his arm. Providing a prosthetic is a rewarding experience as you can see the difference you make to people."" Mrs Orshak said: ""The project is called Regenerate Ukrainians - so Ukrainians get the limbs for free and we are looking for partners to donate to the Dopomogator Foundation. ""When I left Ukraine I left a piece of my heart there and I'm doing this to keep my spirits up. ""I contact my husband and daughter everyday to see if they are safe - but we never know when Russia may bomb, so we have to keep in touch."" She added she was ""really thankful"" to he people of Whitley Bay and the ""kind hearts and safe home"" her host family has provided for her and her 14-year-old daughter Yustyna. Mrs Orshak, who worked as a lawyer in Lviv, now works for Newcastle City Council as a data apprentice. She previously helped collect donations of aid to be sent to Ukraine from across the north east of England. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Jack Teixeira: The video game players sharing secrets online," The news that a US serviceman allegedly leaked classified information on a video game forum came as a surprise to many - but experts say it highlights an increasingly common new challenge for security services. Jack Texeira was enlisted in the Air National Guard - where he had access to top secret material. He has been accused of leaking sensitive documents about the war in Ukraine and other issues, allegedly to impress his friends on the Discord group where he spent much of his time. In fact, posting classified material in video game chat groups is becoming increasingly common, and the people leaking it often have very different motivations to traditional whistleblowers. War Thunder is a free-to-play vehicle combat simulator made by Gaijin Entertainment, a Russian founded company now based in Budapest. Players use jets, attack helicopters, tanks, artillery, and other weapons to battle opponents. Fans of the video game have long been sharing classified documents, including user manuals for American fighter jets. ""There isn't really another game like War Thunder,"" says one player who gave his name as Lukas. He is, in his own words, a nerd who loves military equipment, and an avid player of the game. ""For many of us players, talking about tanks in the forums or on Reddit is like old gentlemen talking about their favourite old timers,"" Lukas said. ""But some idiots take stuff like this way too seriously and if they have access to classified documents that prove their point in a discussion they will leak it."" War Thunder prides itself on the realism of its weapons, but just how realistic they are is a matter of debate. In an effort to prove strangers on the internet wrong and convince developers to update weapons in the game, players have repeatedly leaked classified technical documents and user manuals. In January, military documents relating to the American F-16 were posted online by a War Thunder player in the midst of a debate on the capabilities of the jet. When discussing the plane's flight and weapon control systems, one forum member posted details about a system known as the Stores Control Panel (SCP) and supported their argument with more documents, including the pilot's user handbook. ""War Thunder is a video game,"" warned one game forum moderator. ""Stop committing federal crimes over internet arguments about it."" But for some players with a security clearance, posting online trumps the potential consequences of breaching security laws. ""People think the online and offline worlds have separate, different relationships. But both create friendships with a sense of community and belonging,"" says Rachel Kowert. She is the research director of Take This, a non-profit focused on mental health and gaming, and says that desire to impress along with the ""online disinhibition effect"" can be a toxic combination. ""Behind a keyboard people are brazen and feel there are far fewer consequences. So they take things further than they would in person."" ""So to win an argument or to impress people they've developed a friendship with online, they take things further. One way to do that? Posting classified documents."" Many players of the combat simulator are serving personnel with access to the documents - but they should know better, warns defence industry consultant Nicholas Drummond. ""There is a very clear line between information that you can share and that you can't,"" he says. Despite this, military documents have been leaked by War Thunder players at least seven times. Details about American, Chinese, British and French military equipment have all appeared in the last few years. In July 2021, classified details from the Army Equipment Support Publication - a user manual of the British Challenger 2 main battle tank were leaked. Later, similar information about the French Leclerc tank and the Franco-German Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter also appeared. In June 2022 Chinese military secrets made it online, in this case a type of anti-tank ammunition used by China's army. The documents leaked by players of the game are at the lower levels of classification. But they're still secret - and publishing them could be risky. Weapon designs are often sought after by hostile states seeking to get an edge on opponents. Some suggest that baiting people into revealing secrets is just another, more modern version of a honey trap. All documents have now been taken down from the forum. ""Our players are very passionate about War Thunder and military vehicles, and sometimes they're too passionate,"" says Anton Yudintsev, founder of Gaijin Entertainment, the maker of War Thunder. But he says players shouldn't bother leaking if they want developers to update the game. ""Our policy is and was always clear: we'll never make changes to the game based on documents without a clear and legal source."" But given the growing trend for video game players to leak classified material online - that warning may fall on deaf ears.

Ukraine war: Russian artists back Putin or face censorship," The war with Ukraine has split Russia's artistic community. Those who support it have enjoyed government backing, but those who oppose it have come under huge pressure to toe the line. Speaking out comes at a price in Russia. You can get killed, jailed or forced into exile, and if you are a person of culture, you can also be frozen out of key platforms and venues. Andrei Makarevich is one of the best-known performers to fall from favour after criticising government policies in Vladimir Putin's Russia. He rose to prominence during the Soviet era as the frontman of a rock group called Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine). State TV once called him ""a Beatle of Perestroika"", referring to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's wide-ranging programme of reforms. But over time Makarevich grew increasingly critical of President Putin. After Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Makarevich wrote a song titled My Country Has Gone Mad and attended anti-war rallies. After this, a string of his concerts across Russia were cancelled, and Makarevich accused the Kremlin of orchestrating a campaign of persecution. After the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, Makarevich left Russia a deeply disillusioned man. ""People have turned out to be much easier to manipulate. More ignorant and aggressive,"" he said in an interview. Nikolai Rastorguyev, on the other hand, is an example of a performer favoured by the state. He is the lead singer of Lyube, which is often described as ""Putin's favourite band"". He is a vocal supporter of the Kremlin's policies including the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Unlike Makarevich, Rastorguyev appears to have enjoyed easy access to Russia's best venues for years. On 15 March 2014, the day Makarevich was nearly assaulted by anti-Ukraine activists following a peace march in Moscow, Lyube celebrated its 25th anniversary at the capital's Olympic Stadium. The following day, his band performed in Crimea in support of a vote that had no international recognition but was used by the Kremlin to justify its annexation of the Ukrainian region. Rastorguyev and his band have played at Kremlin-organised mass rallies held at Russia's largest stadium, Luzhniki, and attended by President Putin. It has also authored a song celebrating a bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In a sign of the band's influence, police searching for political subversives have even forced patrons at a bar in Moscow to sing a Lyube song, as proof that they support the government. Nikolai Rastorguyev is subject to EU sanctions imposed for their role in ""the Kremlin's disinformation and information manipulation ecosystem"". In Russia, numerous performers critical of the Kremlin, such as Makarevich, have been officially designated as ""foreign agents"". Divisions run deep among stars of film and theatre, too. Nikita Mikhalkov is one of Russia's most celebrated actors and film directors. One of the pinnacles of his career is Oscar-winning drama Burnt By The Sun (1994), which he both directed and starred in. The film is about lives wrecked by terror in the USSR under Soviet leader Stalin. Mikhalkov's views are also very close to the Kremlin's official ideology: he is a religious conservative, and he espouses extreme anti-Western views. He shares these conspiracy theories in his TV show Besogon (Exorcist), which is aired on state television and is said to number President Putin among its viewers. Mikhalkov is an ardent supporter of Vladimir Putin. In 2007, he co-authored an open letter calling on the Russian president to seek a third presidential term in violation of the constitution. The same year, Mikhalkov made a film celebrating Putin's 55th birthday, which was shown on the day by state TV. The film director has headed Russia's Union of Film-Makers since 1997, and he has received numerous awards and funding from the state, including the Defence Ministry's award for ""developing the Fatherland's culture and art"", and $2m in state funding for a sequel to Burnt By The Sun. He has supported Russia's war on Ukraine in 2022, parroting the president's rhetoric that Ukraine is ruled by a ""Nazi regime"" and that the very Ukrainian language is a manifestation of hatred towards Russia. Months after the invasion started, Vladimir Putin awarded Mikhalkov the title of a ""Hero of Labour"" at a ceremony in the Kremlin. Thanking the president, the film-maker referred to the fighting in Ukraine and said that ""a new Russia"" was being forged there. For his role in spreading ""Kremlin propaganda narratives"", Mikhalkov has been sanctioned by the EU. Actress Liya Akhedzhakova holds very different political views, and her career has followed a different trajectory. She rose to fame in the 1970s thanks to roles in hugely popular Soviet films such as The Irony of Fate and Office Romance, as well as numerous performances at Sovremennik, one of Moscow's best theatres. Since the break-up of the USSR, the diminutive actress has never shied away from making her political views public, and has often been harshly critical of government policies. At a rally in Moscow in 2014, she praised the so-called Euromaidan - protests in Kyiv that led to the toppling of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine. There was applause and chants of support as Akhedzhakova urged the crowd to honour the pro-democracy demonstrators killed in the Ukrainian capital. By the time President Putin had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later, rallies like this were unimaginable in Russia. Speaking on the day of the invasion to independent Dozhd TV, Akhedzhakova urged fellow performers and celebrities to oppose it. ""I'm calling on all people of culture - the time has come to speak out. We have to speak out. We won't get another chance. A war is going on, and there are so many lies, a whole sea of lies,"" she said. Less than a week later, Dozhd was forced to relocate abroad due to tightening censorship and concerns for the welfare of its staff. A year later, Akhedzhakova lost her last role at Sovremennik after 45 years of working at the theatre. According to the actress, the theatre's newly appointed director told her it had been ""inundated"" with letters criticising her - a practice reminiscent of state-orchestrated persecution campaigns in the Soviet Union. In another echo of Stalinism, a pro-government activist recently asked prosecutors to check if the actress was guilty of treason.

Russia's Belgorod sees mass evacuations over undetonated bomb," More than 3,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in the Russian city of Belgorod after an undetonated explosive was found. It comes two days after Russia accidentally dropped a bomb on the same city, damaging houses and injuring several people. It's not known if the bomb discovered on Saturday came from the same aircraft - a Russian Sukhoi-34 fighter-jet. The city is located about 40km (25 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, confirmed on Telegram that 17 apartment buildings had to be cordoned off ""within a radius of 200 metres"", affecting 3,000 residents. He later said people were starting to return to their homes after a ""shell"" had been removed. The undetonated device was found in the same area as the bomb that was accidentally dropped on Thursday evening, leaving a huge crater about 20 metres (60 ft) wide close to the city centre. The explosion was so large it blew a car on to the roof of a nearby shop. After that incident, the Russian defence ministry admitted that one of its Su-34 jets had ""accidentally discharged aircraft ordnance"" over the city. Dramatic CCTV footage of Thursday's blast shows an object landing near a crossroads with passing cars, and detonating about 18 seconds later. It's not the first such incident - last October a Sukhoi fighter-jet - again, an Su-34 - crashed in the Russian city of Yeysk killing at least 13 people. Russian jets regularly fly over Belgorod, a city of 370,000, on their way to Ukraine. It lies just north of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, and has come under periodic Ukrainian attack since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.

Ukraine war: Bakhmut defender remembered by comrades," Staff sergeant Pavel Kuzin took his position at the machine gun - the only soldier still able to fight. Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured. Suffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field. It was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety. The Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many ""unprecedentedly bloody"" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost. Pavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position. Unlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell. ""There was a bright flash,"" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. ""I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away."" It was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead. Tsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others. Two minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing. At that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry. The 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before. ""The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,"" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. ""Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity."" ""They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming."" Hlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder. A number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called ""illegal orders"" to send them ""to be slaughtered"". Last month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders. Often these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat. These wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost. Ukrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post. Also, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target. That was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued. Tsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, ""turning the internal organs upside down"", he said. He was barely conscious. ""I didn't see much, it was all white,"" he said. ""I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything."" Next to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says. By that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet. Commanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers. The next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back. ""The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,"" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank. Russian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells. ""Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,"" Palamarchuk explains. ""They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide."" Ukraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: ""The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production."" Palamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived. The whole operation over just a kilometre's distance lasted for six hours. It was past midnight but the entire battalion gathered at the evacuation point to pay their respects to Pavel, who is survived by his daughter and wife. ""It was a huge loss for our unit,"" Palamarchuk says. ""He saved two people but died himself."" ",1241,world,2023-04-21T23:38:38.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65313367
Russian army launches campaign encouraging men to join," A wide-ranging advertising campaign appears to have been launched in Russia urging citizens to join the military. It comes as the Russian armed forces have reportedly been suffering heavy losses and struggling to make progress in Ukraine more than a year after invading it. The Defence Ministry in Moscow released a video appealing to Russians to give up their civilian jobs in favour of a contract with the military. The video features a supermarket guard, a fitness instructor and a taxi driver - all apparently disillusioned with civilian life and finding fulfilment after joining the army. The video promises a monthly salary of at least 204,000 roubles ($2,500; £2,000), four times Russia's average. Ukrainian propagandists were quick to subvert the ad, producing an edited version with the wording changed. The characters in the video are now against killing children and beheadings, and ""don't want to be held responsible for [President Vladimir] Putin's war crimes"". While the Russian version says ""be a man"", the Ukrainian video responds ""be a person"" - in other words, don't commit atrocities. The Russian video is part of a wider campaign that has received generous airtime on state TV, and also appeared in the press. On VKontakte, Russia's most popular social network, the number of army ads has jumped sevenfold, according to research by independent website Novaya Gazeta. The campaign in the media has run alongside army advertising in Russia's streets. ""Impossible to understate just how ubiquitous this army recruitment drive is,"" said one Twitter user in the Russian capital. ""It has completely taken over Moscow and you can barely go two minutes without seeing another poster."" The recruitment drive is likely to have been prompted by the Russian military's desperate need for new soldiers after more than a year of fighting in Ukraine. According to leaked US documents, the Pentagon estimates Russian losses at between 189,500 and 223,000 casualties, with 35,500-43,000 men killed in action. In September 2022, President Vladimir Putin announced ""partial mobilisation"", which sought to recruit new soldiers regardless of whether they wanted to join the army, and led to a dip in his popularity. This time, the authorities in Moscow seem keen to avoid openly declaring mobilisation. ""There is no talk in the Kremlin about a new wave of mobilisation,"" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on 21 April. He was responding to a question about reports that students in the Russian capital have started receiving call-up papers. Other ways of boosting army numbers which have been used by the Russian government include allowing the Wagner private military company to recruit mercenaries in prisons. Also in April 2023, the Russian parliament made it easier to recruit new army members and much more difficult to avoid the draft by approving legislation to start serving call-up papers online. Under a decree issued by President Putin in September 2022, those who sign up will not be able to leave the army until the war - officially known as the ""special military operation"" in Russia - is over.

Vladimir Kara-Murza: Family's heartbreak at Putin critic's jail term," Evgenia Kara-Murza has been surviving on autopilot ever since her husband, Vladimir, was convicted of treason for his public criticism of President Vladimir Putin and Russia's war on Ukraine. On Monday, the Russian opposition politician was sentenced to 25 years in a high security prison and his wife has no idea when she or the couple's three children will ever see him again. She's been so outspoken herself, she can't risk travelling to Russia in case she too ends up in jail. ""I'm afraid they might detain me to put pressure on Vladimir, and I can't afford him losing my voice as well, or leaving our kids without both parents,"" Evgenia explained over the phone from the US, where the family live for safety. She says she's ""heartbroken"" - she hasn't even been allowed to speak to her husband since his arrest over a year ago - but for now she's numbed herself against the enormity of the verdict to focus on rallying international support. Vladimir Kara-Murza is also a British citizen, but whilst the US, Canada and Latvia moved quickly to sanction Russian officials they hold responsible for the activist's plight, his own government has been left playing catch-up. On Friday, the UK Foreign Office announced sanctions against one judge and two investigators involved in Kara-Murza's trial, as well as two Federal Security Service (FSB) agents suspected of links to his sudden, critical illness in 2015 and 2017 caused by a toxin that has never been identified. Evgenia welcomed that move, but it's well short of the more than 30 names she put forward. ""It only saddens me that it took a year of unlawful detention, a horrific sentence of 25 years in a strict regime and a very concerning deterioration of my husband's health for the British government to move to a somewhat stronger response,"" she told me, shortly after the announcement. Vladimir Kara-Murza has again been losing feeling in both his feet and his left hand - symptoms which first appeared after his poisoning. A prison doctor has diagnosed polyneuropathy, which affects the nerves. ""For years, he was able to keep those symptoms at bay with regular exercise, but now they've returned and seem to be spreading,"" Evgenia says. ""I believe the Russian authorities are using it as torture; slowly killing a person."" Vladimir Kara-Murza was born in Moscow in 1981 and moved to the UK as a teenager when his mother married a Yorkshireman. He went to public school in Harrow then read history at Cambridge. He has a taste for tweed jackets and smoking pipes, and in one of the letters he sent me from prison, he listed Yes, Minister! and Fawlty Towers among his favourite TV shows. Kara-Murza is as eloquent in English as in Russian, and uses both to condemn how President Putin has systematically crushed the democratic values that the activist holds so dear. But his political ambitions have always focused firmly on his homeland. In his application to study at Cambridge, which I was shown, a teenage Kara-Murza described his greatest aspiration as ""leading the country in which I was born"". He grew up during Russia's short-lived but intense burst of democratic chaos as the Soviet Union fell apart. At 13, he even set up his own children's political party and tried to get it registered with the Justice Ministry in Moscow, which refused. ""Even for those democratic days, this was too much,"" he joked in one letter to me from his cell, with a grinning emoji. His first significant political memory is of the failed coup in 1991, when hardliners tried to topple Mikhail Gorbachev and reverse his liberalising reforms. Kara-Murza's father joined the giant crowd that built barricades around the parliament then, and the activist describes those as ""the best and freest days"" in Russia's modern history. By the time he graduated and returned to Moscow in 2003, President Putin was tightening the political screws. That autumn, aged 22, Kara-Murza ran for a seat in the Russian parliament and lost. Genuine opposition candidates were still allowed on the ballot in those days, but the city authorities would extinguish the lights on his campaign billboards, and when he appeared in a TV debate, his microphone was cut. Two decades on, he still refuses to be silenced. His trial for treason was held behind closed doors although no state secrets were involved. Even the official charge sheet makes it clear that he's being punished for challenging the Kremlin: the case is based on public political speeches, made at home and abroad. So when he gave his final address to the court from a cage of bulletproof glass, the only audience before him was made up of prosecutors, investigators and judges: all cogs in the system that had found the activist guilty the day it ordered his arrest a year earlier. But the text of his speech was quickly leaked by his supporters who posted it online in a modern-day version of samizdat, the way works of dissident writers were copied and shared in Soviet times. It was short, under four minutes, if you read it aloud. But Kara-Murza would have weighed every word, aware that it was the most important address of his political life. It delivers his own, damning judgement of President Putin's rule. He calls Russia's president a ""dictator"" and ""usurper"" and condemns his ""criminal war"" on Ukraine. It's exactly the kind of talk that got him arrested. Kara-Murza also recalls his great friend and political inspiration, Boris Nemtsov. Once a prominent reformer, Nemtsov was shot and killed in 2015, just metres from the Kremlin. Kara-Murza himself first fell critically ill a few months later. After meeting in England, the two became close allies and friends, later collaborating on a project that was a huge irritant to Russia's most rich and powerful. They lobbied hard in the US for legislation known as the Magnitsky Act, allowing for punitive sanctions against Russian human rights violators. The bill took aim at a corrupt elite enjoying private schools, bank accounts and extravagant property in the West whilst trampling on basic freedoms at home. A series of European countries soon passed their own versions of the law and Evgenia Kara-Murza believes the treatment of her husband is payback. ""I think it's for a combination of things, including how he continues being unequivocal in his opposition to the regime and its crimes,"" she says. ""But 35 or 36 countries have the Magnitsky legislation now, which shows that Vladimir is very effective in his work. It's why they hate him so much."" Sergei Podoprigorov, the chief judge who sentenced Kara-Murza to prison, was one of the earliest targets of the list. But Kara-Murza's ""Last Word"", his speech to a small, wood-panelled court in Moscow, was more than a denunciation of tyranny and a terrible war. It also conveyed his own dream, of another Russia. A country he still believes can one day be truthful, democratic and free. ""That day will come as surely as spring comes after even the iciest of winters,"" he insisted from the dock, addressing anyone who might hear, against all the odds. It's that vision that has carried Vladimir Kara-Murza this far. It's now the faith he must cling to in the solitude of his prison cell.

US defence secretary seeks to hearten Nato relations, ,1216,world,2023-04-21T21:10:22.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65355473
Ukraine in Nato: Orban casts doubt on long-term membership plan," Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has cast doubt on Ukraine's long-held aspiration to join Nato. His intervention came after the bloc's boss, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Friday that ""all Nato allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a Nato member"". Mr Stoltenberg has consistently said Kyiv will join Nato in the medium term, once the Russian invasion is over. But Mr Orban was quick to express his surprise at the latest claim in a one-word tweet on Friday afternoon. ""What?!"" the Hungarian prime minister exclaimed, reacting to an article on Mr Stoltenberg's comments. Nato is a military alliance of 31 countries, mainly in Europe, but also including the US and Canada. Hungary, like all members, can veto new members joining. Nato members - including Hungary - agreed in 2008 that Ukraine would eventually join the alliance, while denying it immediate membership. Joining the bloc brings the protection of Nato's Article Five, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all. In effect, it means that if Ukraine were invaded or attacked all Nato members - including the US - would come to its aid. But Hungary, which joined Nato in 1999, has already shown a willingness to oppose the expansion of the alliance. After months of delays, it signed off on Finland's bid to join in March. And it has joined with Turkey in holding up Sweden's bid. In March government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács accused officials in Sweden of sitting on a ""crumbling throne of moral superiority"". Relations have long been tense between Kyiv and Budapest. Mr Orban is less critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin than other Western leaders. And while his government has condemned the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Hungarian leader has not sent arms to Kyiv. Hungary has also spent years blocking high-level summits between Nato officials and Ukrainian military leaders, claiming to have concerns over the rights of Hungarian speakers in western Ukraine. Despite his assertion, Mr Stoltenberg conceded at a meeting at the Ramstein US air base in Germany that Kyiv's bid to join the alliance was not an immediate priority. ""The main focus now is of course on how to ensure that Ukraine prevails [in the war with Russia],"" he said. ""Without a sovereign, independent Ukraine, there is no meaning in discussing membership."" But Budapest's stance promises to ignite a fresh dispute within Nato. The bloc's eastern members have spent months pushing officials to give Kyiv an accession timeline and to provide signals that it is making progress to joining the alliance. Mr Stoltenberg also said he was confident Ukraine could regain ground in a much-anticipated counter-offensive. ""I'm confident that they will now be in a position to be able to liberate even more land,"" he said. There has been talk for some weeks of Ukraine launching a spring offensive against Russian forces, whose own offensive in the eastern Donbas region has largely stalled. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Wednesday that some aspects of the planned counteroffensive were already underway.

Watch moment Russian warplane accidentally bombs Belgorod, ,503,world,2023-04-21T15:41:02.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65346486
Ukraine war: Russian warplane accidentally bombs own city," A Russian Sukhoi-34 fighter-jet has accidentally bombed the Russian city of Belgorod, around 40km (25 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The bomb left a 20m (60ft) crater and caused an explosion so large it blew a car on to the roof of a nearby shop. Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said authorities had ordered the evacuation of a damaged nine-storey block of flats as a precaution. Three people were injured and several buildings were damaged, he said. Video posted on social media showed the impact of the blast, lifting a vehicle on to the roof of a supermarket as traffic streamed along Prospekt Vatutina, close to the centre of the city. In a brief statement, the Russian defence ministry admitted that one of its Su-34 fighter bombers had ""accidentally discharged aircraft ordnance"" at 22:15 local time (19:15 GMT) on Thursday. It was a bureaucratic way of saying that the jet had mistakenly fired a weapon. It didn't specify which one. The bomb landed at an intersection of two roads not far from the city centre and next to residential buildings. Two women were taken to hospital for treatment, according to the governor. But with a Russian bomber hitting a busy residential district the consequences could have been far worse. ""Thank God no one was killed,"" he said on social media. CCTV footage of the incident suggests that local residents did, indeed, have a lucky escape. The video shows a series of cars passing a crossroads, before an object lands on the ground nearby. There is no immediate explosion. The ordnance detonates approximately 18 seconds later, blowing up a section of the road, catching one of the cars as it passes and sending a parked car flying into the air before it lands on the supermarket roof. Though embarrassing for the Russian military, the admission of ""an accident"" suggests that officials here do not believe the incident will negatively impact Russian public opinion of what the Kremlin still calls its ""special military operation"". In times of war and conflict, accidents happen, sometimes with devastating consequences. Last October a Sukhoi fighter jet - again, an Su-34 - crashed in the Russian city of Yeysk killing at least 13 people. The military says it has launched an investigation into the incident. Quoting a former military pilot, pro-government news site Moskovsky Komsomolets suggested ""the conclusions [of the investigation] are unlikely to be made public, but lessons will be learned"". By morning maintenance workers had begun the work of repairing the busy intersection in Belgorod. The mayor said much of the work would take place at the weekend and the road would be resurfaced on Monday. The regional governor said Belgorod's residents had endured a difficult night but would get through it. Russian jets regularly fly over Belgorod, a city of 370,000, on their way to Ukraine. It lies just north of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, and has come under periodic Ukrainian attack since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.

Russian lawyer for jailed opposition activist Kara-Murza flees," A lawyer for Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was jailed for 25 years this week, says he had to flee Russia before the verdict. Vadim Prokhorov said he decided to go after receiving a warning there was ""interest"" in him. Mr Prokhorov has defended prominent Russian dissidents and activists. Meanwhile, it has emerged an interior ministry driver is facing a long jail term for spreading ""fake news"" about the war in a personal phone call. Sergei Klokov's phone was tapped a few weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and he was detained in March 2022. He reportedly told a friend over the phone: ""We think we are fighting fascism, but there isn't fascism there. There isn't."" The state prosecutor has asked the court to give him a nine-year jail term. Mr Klokov's lawyer argues any comments his client made were in private conversations and therefore cannot be considered an attempt to disseminate information to the wider public. Russia's attempts to silence criticism of its invasion of Ukraine continue to yield harsh consequences. Last Monday, a judge in Moscow gave Russian-British former journalist and politician Vladimir Kara-Murza 25 years in jail, after finding him guilty of treason, spreading ""false"" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an ""undesirable organisation"". Kara-Murza has repeatedly denied all the charges. He has nearly died twice after being poisoned, but refused to leave Russia despite the growing risk to Kremlin critics. Mr Prokhorov explained to US broadcaster Voice of America that he had decided to leave Russia after receiving ""a warning through one politician that there was interest from at least one deputy prosecutor-general who was overseeing our case"". ""Both the prosecutor and the trial judge said it was necessary not only to remove me from the Chamber of Lawyers but also to consider opening a criminal case,"" he explained. ""Right now in Russia, an attack is being waged not only against journalists - just as there was previously against [opposition] politicians - but also against lawyers. Several of my colleagues are already in detention,"" he added. Mr Prokhorov has previously defended prominent opposition politician Ilya Yashin and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. Yashin lost his appeal against an eight-and-a-half year jail term on Wednesday, also on a charge of spreading false news about the army. He was found guilty of making statements about war crimes alleged to have been committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.

"Blinding flash over Kyiv was probably meteor, says Ukraine space agency"," A mysterious flash which lit up skies over Ukraine's capital on Wednesday night generated much speculation. Officials in Kyiv initially suspected it was a Nasa satellite falling to Earth but the US space agency told the BBC it was still in orbit. Ukrainian space officials said later the flash had probably come from a meteor entering the atmosphere. The air force was confident it was not a Russian air attack - an event all too familiar since the invasion last year. The bright glow was observed in the sky over the capital around 22:00 local time (19:00 GMT). An air raid alert was activated but ""air defence was not in operation"", the head of Kyiv's military administration, Serhiy Popko, said on Telegram. Mr Popko suggested it was caused by a Nasa space satellite falling to Earth, referring to a retired 300kg (660lb) spacecraft that the space agency announced was set to re-enter the atmosphere on Wednesday. The RHESSI satellite, used to observe solar flares, was launched into low Earth orbit in 2002 and decommissioned in 2018, Nasa said. But Rob Margetta from Nasa's office of communications told the BBC that the satellite was still in orbit at the time the flash was observed, and was due to re-enter Earth's atmosphere during the night. Satellite-tracking website Satflare indicated that RHESSI was nowhere near Ukraine at the time. Ukrainian social media has been awash with theories and memes about what the flash could have been, with a popular theme being that it was caused by aliens. But air force spokesman Yuri Ihnat told Ukrainian TV that the flash had also been seen over neighbouring Belarus to the north and Ukraine's space agency said it was probably related to a cosmic body entering the dense layers of the atmosphere. Kyiv officials said it was up to experts to establish what it was but what was most important was the city's security.

Ukrainian vodka producers toast a rise in global sales," When Russia invaded Ukraine last year its vodkas were quickly removed from shelves around the world. It was an opportunity for rival Ukrainian brands to take their place. Yuriy Sorochynskiy says that he and his colleague are ""filled with immense pride"" that their Ukrainian vodka Nemiroff continues to see sales soar around the world. ""We are thrilled and excited to see our brand being recognised globally,"" adds the company's chief executive. ""And we are grateful to our customers abroad who are choosing Nemiroff out of solidarity with Ukraine."" Vodka, the neutral, clear spirit that a great many people would say only tastes of alcohol, doesn't normally make newspaper headlines. With annual global sales of $46.6bn (£37.5bn), its a ubiquitous product that drinkers around the world add to soft drinks, use as the base for a cocktail, or down neat as a ""shot"". Yet last year, vodka suddenly found itself in the international media spotlight following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The start of the conflict resulted in Western consumers, retailers and governments boycotting and banning Russian vodkas. At the same time, Western vodka brands that have Russian sounding names, such as global bestseller Smirnoff, were quick to point out that they aren't actually from Russia. Smirnoff is instead owned by UK drinks giant Diageo. The national origin of vodka is both hotly contested and difficult to define due to changing borders and countries over the centuries. But most drinks historians would agree that today's Poland, Russia and Ukraine are the historic heart of vodka production. With Russian vodkas still mostly absent from international shelves, previously little-known Ukrainian brands are continuing to take their place. Yet maintaining production in a war-torn country is, unsurprisingly, not without its difficulties. Immediately following the Russian invasion, Nemiroff had to close its main distillery for a month. This is located in the city of Nemyriv, some 250km (155m) south west of the capital Kyiv. Like most businesses in Ukraine it has subsequently been affected by power cuts due to Russian attacks on electricity infrastructure. Despite this, the firm says it has seen a big rise in exports, including a two-fold increase in sales in the UK. ""It's heartwarming to see people supporting our country through their purchasing decisions,"" says Mr Sorochynskiy. Fellow Ukrainian vodka boss Dima Deinega says that his distillery, based in the city of Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, ""has showcased amazing resilience"". ""We've dealt with shelling and no power supplies but are still able to produce and export vodka,"" says Mr Deinega, whose brand is called Dima's. Since the start of the conflict he has been giving a share of the profits to Ukrainian charities. ""[Global] sales were rising consistently before the war, but have increased significantly with people looking for ways to support Ukraine via our charitable initiatives, as well as to support Ukrainian products as a whole,"" says Mr Deinega. Katherine Vellinga grew up in Canada, the daughter of Ukrainian emigres. Back in 1997 she had decided to move to Ukraine, and she became increasingly interested in Ukrainian vodka. So much so, that she and her husband bought an old distillery and created vodka brand Zirkova in 2005. Following Russia's invasion the distillery had to close. To maintain some production, Ms Vellinga decided to start using a second facility, this time more than 7,000km (4,000 miles) away in Ontario. Supervised by the firm's master distiller, the company's Canadian brand is called Zirkova Unity, and all its profits go to Ukrainian charities. Production of Unity has continued in Canada despite the firm's main distillery, in the Ukrainian city of Zolotonosha, south of Kyiv, reopening last September. Commenting on the move to Canada, Ms Vellinga says that ""necessity was the mother of invention"". She adds: ""Our people in Ukraine encouraged us to keep fighting, to be resilient, to find a way to survive as that was the only way we could help Ukraine. ""We made a decision to survive and Ukrainians encouraged us to keep going."" But does all vodka taste the same? ""Absolutely not!"" says Tony Abou Ganim, a US-based vodka expert. ""All you need to do is line up six vodkas, made from different raw materials, and coming from different parts of the world, to very quickly realise that all vodkas are not the same!"" More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. In Poland, Russia and Ukraine, the heart of the so-called ""vodka belt"",  the spirit is traditionally drunk neat. And although the origin of the drink is hotly debated, Poland certainly has the strictest legal rules that govern vodka's production. Polish vodka can only be made from wheat, rye, oats, potatoes or triticale (a hybrid of wheat and rye), water and yeast. This contrasts with vodkas from around the world that can use maize, rice, sugar, grape juice or even milk, plus any number of other ingredients or additives. ""Vodka is not a flavourless drink,"" says Mariusz Dampc of the Polish Vodka Museum in Warsaw. ""That is a very Western view,"" he adds. ""Polish vodka is all about the soil, the water, the climate and the human element: the terroir."" Ms Vellinga adds that many ""new world vodkas"" - which she defines as those made outside of the drink's historic heartland shouldn't use the name. ""You can taste the difference between true vodka made out of grain or potato, and poor substitutes that use cheap ingredients such as corn, sugar beet, rice and sorghum,"" she says. ""Newer vodka brands adhere to this modern mistaken notion that vodka should be utterly tasteless and neutral, which is far from the truth. ""The subtle but important complexity and character of the world's greatest vodkas prove it."" ",946,business,2023-04-20T00:47:40.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65308056

India's population to surpass China this week - UN," India will overtake China to become the most populous country in the world by the end of this week, the United Nations has said. India's population is expected to reach 1,425,775,850 people by the end of April, the new data shows. A different UN body last week predicted that India would overtake China by the middle of this year. The Asian nations have accounted for more than a third of the global population for over 70 years. ""China will soon cede its long-held status as the world's most populous country,"" the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) said in a statement. It added that ""due to the uncertainty associated with estimating and projecting populations, the specific date on which India is expected to surpass China in population size is approximate and subject to revision"". The UN Population Fund said last week India would have 2.9 million more people than China by the middle of 2023. China's birth rate has plunged recently, with its population shrinking last year for the first time since 1961. China's population could drop below 1 billion before the end of the century, DESA said. ""By contrast, India's population is expected to continue growing for several decades,"" it added. However, fertility rates are dropping in India, too - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to 2.2 births per woman today. In November, the global population crossed 8 billion. But experts the growth is not as rapid as it was - and is now at its slowest rate since 1950. ",255,world,2023-04-24T16:58:50.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65380148
China disowns ambassador's remarks questioning Ukrainian independence," China has distanced itself from the remarks of one of its envoys who questioned the sovereignty of Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. Paris ambassador Lu Shaye's comments last week caused widespread outrage, leading on calls to Beijing to clarify. On Monday, China's foreign ministry said it respected the independence of all post-Soviet republics. China is a major ally of Russia and has not condemned President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine last year. It sees itself as a major player in attempts to bring peace to Ukraine, but has become an increasingly important trading partner for Russia amid Western sanctions prompted by the invasion, and many in the West doubt its impartiality on the issue. In an interview for the French LCI network last week, Ambassador Lu was asked China's view of the status of Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014. The interviewer argued that under international law the region was part of Ukraine. Mr Lu responded by suggesting that the issue was not clear cut, and that countries such as Ukraine could not rely on international law to defend their sovereignty. ""Even these former Soviet countries don't have an effective status under international law because there is no international agreement under international law to concretise their status as sovereign countries,"" he said. President Putin has frequently challenged Ukrainian independence. In a speech days before the start of Russia's invasion last year, he denied Ukraine had any ""real statehood"" and said the country was an integral part of Russia's history and culture. On Monday Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning rejected Mr Lu's position, saying Beijing respected the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries and upheld the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. She said that while ""the Soviet Union was a federal state and had the status of an entity of international law in its entirety in foreign affairs... this does not deny the fact that each member republic of the Soviet Union has the status of a sovereign state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union"". Later the Chinese embassy in Paris said in a statement quoted by AFP that Mr Lu's remarks were a personal point of view and should not be over-interpreted. Three Baltic countries, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, have summoned China's representatives to clarify Mr Lu's comments. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said, quoted by AFP, that the diplomats would be asked to explain if the Chinese position had changed on independence and reminded that ""we're not post-Soviet countries but we're the countries that were illegally occupied by Soviet Union"". The three countries were seized by the USSR in 1940 and only achieved independence in 1991 as it was collapsing. Other European Union foreign ministers condemned the remarks, and were set to discuss them at a meeting of the 27-member bloc on Monday. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak also questioned Mr Lu's interpretation of international law and described his take on Crimea as ""absurd"". ""If you want to be a major political player, do not parrot the propaganda of Russian outsiders,"" he said on Sunday. Mr Lu has caused controversy in the past, and is known as one of the ""Wolf Warriors"" of Chinese diplomacy for his abrasive style. He told French media in June 2021 that he was ""honoured"" to be given this title because there were so many ""mad hyenas attacking China"". He has several times been summoned by the French government to explain his remarks, including for suggesting that old people had been abandoned in care homes during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Australian defence review plots pivot from armour to missiles," Australia will speed up efforts to buy longer range missiles to counter the growing threat from China, a major defence review says. It warns the country can no longer be protected by its geographic isolation in the ""missile age"". The government will spend some A$19bn ($12bn, £10bn) to deliver the report's immediate recommendations. The 110-page study is described as the biggest overhaul of Australian defence since World War Two. The Defence Strategic Review (DSR) comes amid increasing regional tension over China's stance towards Taiwan, which it has repeatedly vowed to take by force if necessary. The Chinese navy has also established a major presence in the South China Sea, claiming parts of it as its own territory, contrary to international law. ""China's military build-up is now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the Second World War. This build up is occurring without transparency or reassurance to the Indo-Pacific region of China's strategic intent,"" the report states. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the review would ""shape the future rather than waiting for the future to shape us"", and its recommendations would make Australia ""more self-reliant, more prepared and more secure"". It recommends that Australia's armed forces switch focus from land-based armour to ""longer-range strike capability, with munitions built in Australia"", Defence Minister Richard Marles said. ""We need to have a defence force which has the capacity to engage in 'impactful projection',"" Mr Marles told reporters. The minister said the acquisition of ""precision strike missiles"" with ranges in excess of 500km (310 miles) would give the army ""the firepower and mobility it needs into the future"". A 2022 think tank report warned of a ""worst-case scenario"" for Australia's military where China took control of territory in the near region during a possible war over Taiwan. And Australia's new defence posture was aimed at keeping ""a major power adversary like China... as far away as possible"", said Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) analyst Dr Malcolm Davis. ""What we're trying to do is to deter China from using force to achieve its policy objectives, including Taiwan or in the South China Sea. So it is about deterrence. But of course, deterrence can fail, as we saw with Ukraine, so you then have to be ready to respond. What we're investing in will dramatically extend our combat reach,"" he said. But he added that while the review was a ""step in the right direction"", it was not a complete solution. ""We're going down the path of a focused force, designed for impactful projection, that is better suited to the sort of threat that we're facing in this decade and beyond, rather than [one] which tries to do everything. But I think more needs to be done. We need to spend more on defence... and we need to invest in getting [forces] much more rapidly into the field."" The strategic review recommends strengthening Australia's northern defences and giving the ADF greater operating ability from northern bases. And Australia will fast track plans to acquire the land-based High Mobility Artillery Rocket (HIMARS) system, used to great effect by Ukraine's army to stem the Russian advance. To fund Australia's new priorities, a number of projects including plans for new self-propelled guns and ammunition supply vehicles for the army, will be shelved. Mr Marles said the review also highlighted the importance of keeping a ""continuous shipbuilding capability in this country"". It also recommended acquiring long-range anti-ship missiles for fighter aircraft, but said the new US B-21 Raider stealth bomber was currently ""not a suitable option"". Last month, the US State Department approved the sale of 220 cruise missiles to Australia in a deal valued at $895m. The non-nuclear missiles will be used by the Virginia-class submarines that Australia will acquire from the US under the Aukus defence pact agreed by Australia, the UK and the US.

Vinesh Phogat: India wrestlers seek chief's arrest over sexual abuse claims," Indian wrestlers are protesting again in Delhi, demanding the arrest of the chief of the sport's governing federation for alleged sexual abuse. They had called off protests in January after the government promised to investigate their complaints. The athletes had accused Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Singh and other officials of sexually harassing women wrestlers for years. Mr Singh has denied the allegations. The protests in January had made international headlines. At the time, the WFI had denied all the allegations made by the wrestlers, including that of sexual misconduct. As the protests continued, the government asked Mr Singh to step aside for a few weeks and formed a panel to oversee the federation's activities. There is no clarity on the status of his position. The WFI website still lists Mr Singh as its president. The Indian Olympic Association also set up a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Singh, who is a lawmaker and politician from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. The committee submitted its report in April but its findings haven't been revealed yet. The BBC has emailed Mr Singh for comment on the allegations. The wrestlers restarted their protests on Sunday, seeking Mr Singh's arrest. They added that seven women athletes had filed separate police complaints against Mr Singh, accusing him of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation. They are also demanding that the government make public the report submitted by the panel that investigated the allegations. On Sunday night, Vinesh Phogat, a two-time World Championship medallist, tweeted a photo of the protesters sleeping in the open. ""From podium to footpath! Under the open sky at night in the hope of justice,"" she tweeted. Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik are also part of the protests. Ms Phogat had alleged in January that at least 10 female wrestlers had confessed to her that they were sexually exploited by Mr Singh. She had also said that they would not compete in international tournaments unless Mr Singh was removed from the post. Ms Phogat had earlier told the BBC that the wrestlers would file a police complaint ""at the right time"". Experts have said that the protests by the wrestlers are significant as it was the first time that top athletes had come together to speak up against alleged abuse of power.

Second cheetah brought to India from Africa dies," A cheetah has died in India's Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh state, the second in less than a month. Forest officials said the cause of the six-year-old male animal's death was not immediately known. It was one of 12 big cats that were brought to India from South Africa in February. India reintroduced cheetahs last year, more than 70 years after the animal was declared officially extinct in the country. On 27 March, a female cheetah who was part of the first batch of animals brought from Namibia had died of a suspected kidney ailment. The reintroduction of cheetahs in India has generated excitement and any news related to them has been making headlines. Eight Namibian cheetahs - five males and three females - were translocated to India last year amid fanfare. Twelve more cheetahs were brought to India from South Africa in February. They were all first kept in a controlled quarantine zone at the park in Kuno before being released into the wild. A team of forest officials and doctors have been tracking and monitoring their movements. The country also welcomed the birth of four cheetah cubs on 29 March. They were born to one of the females that came from Namibia last September. India's environment minister, Bhupendra Yadav, had announced the news, calling it a ""momentous event"". Cheetahs have great symbolic value in India as they are part of many folktales. But it is also the only large mammal to become extinct since independence in 1947. Hunting, diminishing habitats and non-availability of enough prey - black buck, gazelle and hare - were the main reasons for the extinction of the cat in India. During British rule, cheetahs were also eliminated through bounty hunting because they were entering villages and killing livestock. Wildlife experts have welcomed the reintroduction of the animal in India but some have also warned of potential risks to them from other predators and not having enough prey.

Sati: How the fight to ban burning of widows in India was won," In December 1829, Lord William Bentinck, the first governor general of British-ruled India, banned sati, the ancient Hindu practice of a widow immolating herself on her husband's funeral pyre. Bentinck, then the governor general of Bengal, sought the views of 49 senior army officers and five judges, and was convinced that the time had come to ""wash out a foul stain upon British rule"". His regulation said sati was ""revolting to the feelings of human nature"" and that it shocked many Hindus as well as ""unlawful and wicked"". The regulation said that those convicted of ""aiding and abetting"" in the burning of a Hindu widow, ""whether the sacrifice be voluntary on her part or not"" would be found guilty of culpable homicide. It empowered the courts to impose the death penalty for persons convicted of using force or assisting in burning alive a widow ""who had been intoxicated and could not have exercised her free will"". Bentinck's law was even more stringent than a more gradualist way of rooting out the practice recommended by leading Indian reformers who campaigned against sati. After the legislation, 300 eminent Hindus, led by Raja Rammohun Roy, thanked him for ""rescuing us forever from the gross stigma hitherto attached to our character as wilful murderers of females"". Orthodox Hindus pushed backed and petitioned Bentinck. Quoting scholars and scriptures, they challenged his case that sati was not an ""imperative duty under the religion"". Bentinck didn't budge. The petitioners went to the Privy Council, the court of last resort in British colonies. In 1832, the Council upheld the regulation, saying sati was a ""flagrant offence against society"". ""The unapologetic combativeness of the 1829 regulation was perhaps the only instance throughout 190 years of colonial rule where a social legislation was enacted without offering any concession to orthodox sentiments,"" notes Manoj Mitta, author of Caste Pride, a new book examining the legal history of caste in India. Also, Mr Mitta writes, ""long before Gandhi famously deployed moral pressure against the British empire, Bentinck had pitted the same force against the caste and gender prejudices intrinsic to sati"". ""By criminalising this one native custom that had so corroded the colonised, the coloniser had scored a moral point."" But, in 1837, Bentinck's law was diluted by another Briton, Thomas Macaulay, author of the Indian Penal Code. In Macaulay's reading if someone could claim with evidence to have lit the pyre at the instigation of the widow, he could be let off lightly. He said in a draft note that women burning themselves could be motivated by a ""strong sense of religious duty, sometimes of a strong sense of honour"". Mr Mitta found that Macaulay's ""sympathetic position"" on sati had resonance with British rulers decades later. He writes his draft was dusted off after the 1857 mutiny when native Hindu and Muslim soldiers, also known as sepoys, rebelled against the British East India Company over fears that gun cartridges were greased with animal fat forbidden by their religions. Now, the diluted regulation made it to the statute book ""fitting the colonial strategy of appeasing high-caste Hindus who had played a leading role"" in the rebellion. The 1862 regulation repealed both the penal provisions which said that sati would be punishable as culpable homicide and the other imposing that the death penalty in aggravated cases. It also meant that it allowed the accused to claim that the victim had consented to her life being terminated at her husband's funeral, so it was a case of suicide rather than a murder. Mr Mitta writes that the dilution of the sati rule was a ""response to the simmering grievances against social legislation"" - outlawing of sati, a 1850 law empowering outcaste and apostate Hindus to inherit family property and a 1856 law allowing remarriage of all widows. But the immediate trigger for pushing through a diluted law was the ""outrage among upper-caste Hindu soldiers"" who were incensed over reports that cartridges had been greased with cow fat. Between 1829 and 1862, the crime of sati had been diminished from murder to abetment of suicide. ""Though less commonly practised since 1829, sati continued to be valorised and revered in certain parts of India, especially among higher castes,"" says Mr Mitta. In a curious twist, Motilal Nehru, a lawyer-politician who joined the Indian National Congress and played a key role in the campaign for independence from British rule, appeared in court defending six upper-caste men in a case of sati in 1913 in Uttar Pradesh. The men said the pyre had ""ignited miraculously through the sheer piety of the widow"". Judges rejected the theory of divine intervention, deplored the cover-up and held the men guilty of abetting suicide - two of them were sentenced to prison for four years. More than 70 years later, there was a final twist in the story of sati. In 1987, a government led by Motilal Nehru's great-grandson Rajiv Gandhi, enacted a law which criminalised for the first time, ""glorification of the practice"". People who supported, justified or propagated sati could be punished for seven years. The law also elevated the practice to murder and reintroduced the death penalty for those who abetted it. This move had followed widespread outrage over the last reported sati in India involving a teenage bride called Roop Kanwar in a small village in the northern state of Rajasthan. It was, Mr Mitta notes, the 41st case of sati officially recorded after Independence in 1947. The preamble to Rajiv Gandhi's law borrowed from Bentinck's regulation. ""It was a tribute paid, even if unwittingly, by a decolonised country to its erstwhile coloniser,"" says Mr Mitta. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Amritpal Singh: Sikh separatist arrested after weeks on the run," Self-styled preacher Amritpal Singh, whose calls for Sikh independence riled India's authorities, has been arrested in Punjab state. The 30-year-old had been on the run for more than a month after evading arrest in Punjab on 18 March. He and his supporters have been accused of attempted murder and attacking police officials. Punjab Police officials confirmed news of the arrest on Twitter and also appealed for peace. Mr Singh was arrested from Rode village in Punjab's Moga district at around 6.45am on Sunday, the state's inspector general Sukhchain Singh Gill said in a press conference. He has been arrested under the stringent National Security Act (NSA), which allows for individuals to be detained without being charged for up to a year. He will be taken to the high-security Dibrugarh jail in Assam state, where some of his supporters have been kept. Mr Singh shot to prominence in February after hundreds of his supporters stormed a police station, demanding the release of an arrested aide. His campaign brought back memories from the 1980s of a separatist insurgency and subsequent crackdown in Punjab in which thousands of people were killed. Mr Singh, who says he supports the Khalistan movement for a separate Sikh homeland, claims to draw inspiration from Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a preacher accused by the Indian government of leading an armed insurgency in the 1980s. Bhindranwale was killed in the Indian army's storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion, in 1984. The manhunt for Mr Singh spanned several parts of northern India, including the capital Delhi and the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Nepal had also put him on its surveillance list at India's request. Police first attempted to arrest Mr Singh on 18 March - thousands of personnel were deployed and traffic blockades were set up across the state to check vehicles. But he escaped in a dramatic car chase which was live-streamed by some of his associates. Within hours of Mr Singh's escape, authorities blocked internet services in Punjab - where 27 million people live - restricted the movement of people, and arrested hundreds of Mr Singh's supporters. Many of them were later released. Akal Takht, the supreme temporal seat of Sikhs, had asked Mr Singh to surrender to the police and co-operate with their investigation. After the crackdown, however, it also questioned the government's arrests and detentions of people for their alleged support of Mr Singh and for Khalistan. Sikh groups in Canada held widespread protests against the government action in Punjab. Protests were also held outside the Indian High Commission in London, where demonstrators removed the Indian flag. India had strongly condemned the incident and summoned the UK's deputy high commissioner in New Delhi to register its protest. In San Francisco, pro-Khalistan supporters vandalised the Indian consulate, calling for Mr Singh to be freed. A couple of weeks after his arrest, Mr Singh had released a video from an undisclosed location, where he termed the crackdown as an ""attack on the Sikh community"". He had also termed as ""unfair"" the invocation of the NSA against him and his supporters. Not much is known about Mr Singh's early years. A resident of Jallupur Khera in Punjab's Amritsar district, he moved to Dubai in 2012 to join his family's transport business. His LinkedIn profile says he has a mechanical engineering degree from a university in Punjab and that he worked as an ""operational manager"" at a cargo company. For many years, reports say, his popularity was restricted to social media where his views on Sikh unity and statehood found plenty of resonance. In August last year, he travelled to India from Dubai, looking like a devout, practising Sikh - visibly different from old photos in which his hair and beard were neatly trimmed. A month later, Mr Singh was appointed head of Waris Punjab De (Heirs of Punjab), an organisation formed by Deep Sidhu, an actor and activist who was arrested in connection with violence during a protest held by farmers - he died in a car accident last year. The ceremony, which was attended by thousands of people, was held in Rode, which is also the ancestral village of Bhindranwale. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Bihar Sharif: The 113-year-old India library torched in a riot," Ash, soot-stained walls, burnt furniture and charred pages: that's all that remains of a 113-year-old madrassa library in India that once housed more than 4,500 books, including ancient manuscripts and sacred Islamic texts written in beautiful calligraphy. The library was part of the Madrassa Azizia - a well-known religious school in Bihar Sharif town in the eastern state of Bihar - and was burnt down by a large mob on 31 March. The incident place during the Hindu festival of Ram Navami. The rioters were armed with sticks, stones and petrol bombs and allegedly shouted provocative slogans near the madrassa before attacking it, locals told the BBC. The incident was one among many that took place in the town that day - several people were injured and some vehicles and shops were attacked. Police have arrested several people in connection with the communal violence, and the investigation is ongoing. Witnesses said that a mob of hundreds broke the locks and front door of the madrassa and then vandalised it. Some hurled petrol bombs inside the classrooms and library, setting them on fire. ""Suddenly I could smell smoke,"" said Abdul Gaffar, a cook at the madrassa. ""When I opened the door, I saw there was a lot of chaos near the office. They (the mob) had moved towards the hostel as well. I got scared and hid under the bed."" The fire gutted the library and all that was inside, including 250 handwritten books, historical documents and antique furniture. The library was mostly used by the students of the madrassa. Around 500 students study here, with 100 staying in the hostel. But they were not in the building as classes had been halted due to Ramadan. ""The damage caused to the building and furniture can be fixed. But the loss of knowledge and cultural heritage is permanent,"" says Syed Saifuddin Firdausi, an Islamic scholar who is president of the Soghara Trust which manages the madrassa. He says the building was targeted earlier as well, in 2017, prompting police to give it protection for a year. The madrassa was built by a woman named Bibi Soghara in memory of her late husband, Abdul Aziz. It was initially built in Patna city in 1896 and later shifted to Bihar Sharif. Bibi Soghara also donated her property - including 14,000 acres of land - to charity. She set up a trust to make sure the income was used to provide education and other help to poor people. The trust used the money to build schools and colleges as well as hospitals and hostels, which are still operational today across Bihar. Mr Firdausi describes Bibi Soghara as an ""enlightened, socially conscious, and wise woman"" who chose to donate her property in the service of the community and the country instead of giving it to her relatives. Her acts of generosity, performed more than a century ago, are still helping the residents of Bihar Sharif. Dr. Mukhtar Ul Haq, a manager of the Soghara Trust, says that an outpatient treatment centre was built last year using funds from the trust . A hospital named after her will be opened soon. While the contents of the library are beyond repair, trust officials are now looking for ways to restore the damaged portions of the madrassa - classes are scheduled to restart from 1 May. According to the trust's estimates, repairing the major damages will cost more than 30mn rupees ($365,088; £294,306). They now plan to send a report to the state government's social welfare department with a request for help with funds. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Montevideo Maru: Australia finds wreck of Japanese WW2 disaster ship," Deep-sea explorers have found the wreck of a Japanese transport ship which sank off the Philippines, killing nearly 1,000 Australian troops and civilians in World War Two. It was Australia's worst maritime disaster: a US submarine torpedoed the ship unaware that it was packed with prisoners captured in Papua New Guinea. The Montevideo Maru sank in July 1942. An estimated 979 Australians died, along with 33 Norwegian sailors and 20 Japanese guards and crew. An Australian maritime archaeology group, Silentworld Foundation, organised the mission, helped by a Dutch deep-sea survey company called Fugro. The wreck was located by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) at a depth of more than 4,000m (13,123ft) - deeper than the Titanic wreck. Captain Roger Turner, a technical specialist in the search team, told the BBC that ""it's a war grave now, it's a tomb that must be treated with appropriate respect"". The closest the AUV got to the wreck was 45m, he said. ""It was a moment of emotion to see the images of the ship, the closed hatch covers where prisoners were kept on the voyage."" The wreck will not be disturbed - human remains or artefacts will not be removed, Silentworld said. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that ""at long last, the resting place of the lost souls of the Montevideo Maru has been found"". ""We hope today's news brings a measure of comfort to loved ones who have kept a long vigil."" The ship was sunk by torpedoes from the USS Sturgeon and went down rapidly. Speaking by phone from the search vessel, Capt Turner said that after being hit, the Montevideo Maru had assumed a steep angle within six minutes and disappeared below the waves in 11 minutes. Just three lifeboats were launched and 102 Japanese crew and guards rowed to the Philippines. Silentworld director John Mullen said families had ""waited years for news of their missing loved ones"". ""Today, by finding the vessel, we hope to bring closure to the many families devastated by this terrible disaster."" Silentworld says that in total the estimated 1,089 victims came from 14 nations and it has not been possible to trace all of their next of kin. But it says descendants of the victims can register with the Australian Defence Force to get updates on the investigation and future commemorations. The search began on 6 April in the South China Sea, 110km (68 miles) north-west of Luzon in the Philippines, and the wreck was located after 12 days. It then took several days to verify the wreck using expert analysis from maritime archaeologists, conservators and other specialists, including ex-naval officers. Scans of the wreck, including the hold, foremast and bow, matched features marked in drawings of the ship. Capt Turner told the BBC that the team were ""euphoric"". ""Many years were invested in this, and more than that, the descendants of the victims number in the thousands. Two who were on board spent much of their lives researching the events, tracking down as many victims as they were able."" Capt Turner said residents of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea - a strategic hub captured by the Japanese in 1942 - still felt their connection to the Montevideo Maru disaster ""very strongly today"". ""They conveyed how important this was to the descendants,"" he said. The team's elation at finally locating the ship was tempered by sadness at the scale of the disaster. ""We're looking at the gravesite of over 1,000 people,"" John Mullen told Australia's ABC News. ""We lost nearly twice as many [Australians] as in the whole of the Vietnam War, so it's extraordinarily significant for families and descendants,"" he said. ""We had two people on board who had family members who were lost, so while on the one side there were cheers, on the other there were a few tears. It was very emotional.""

Nuclear weapons: Why South Koreans want the bomb," Hidden away in the private room of an underground restaurant in Seoul, a disparate group of South Koreans have gathered for a clandestine lunch. Among the mix are politicians, scientists, and military people, some of whose identities are too sensitive to reveal. This is the meeting of the newly formed Forum for Nuclear Strategy, and their lunchtime agenda is ambitious - to plot out how South Korea can develop nuclear weapons. This once-fringe idea has exploded into the mainstream over the past months. Even South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol raised the possibility during a defence meeting, making him the only president to have put this option on the table in recent times. Now newspaper columns trumpet the idea daily, while a staggering three-quarters of the public support it. South Koreans have grown anxious about their nuclear-armed neighbour to the north, and on Wednesday Mr Yoon is heading to the White House, seeking President Joe Biden's help. South Korea previously flirted with the idea of developing nuclear weapons in the 1970s, when it ran a secret programme. But when the United States found out, it issued an ultimatum: Seoul could carry on, or have the US defend it, with the full force of its existing nuclear arsenal. It picked US support, and to this day tens of thousands of US troops remain stationed on the Korean peninsula. Since then, the geopolitical situation has shifted dramatically. North Korea is building ever-more sophisticated nuclear weapons that can target cities across the US, leaving people to question whether Washington would still come to South Korea's defence. Here is the scenario they chew over: a belligerent Kim Jong-un attacks South Korea, forcing the US to intervene. Mr Kim then threatens to detonate a nuclear bomb over the US mainland unless it withdraws from the war. What does Washington do? Does it risk having San Francisco reduced to rubble to save Seoul? Probably not, is the conclusion those at the secret lunchtime meeting have come to. ""It is irrational to think another country should protect us. This is our problem and our responsibility,"" said Choi Ji-young, a forum member and member of South Korea's ruling People Power Party. The chairman of the forum, academic Cheong Seong-chang, presented their suggested plan. The next time the North tests a nuclear weapon, Seoul would withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). If, within six months, Mr Kim has not agreed to discuss giving up some of his weapons, Seoul would start building its own. Mr Cheong argues that this would reduce the probability of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, as Mr Kim would be less likely to attack, knowing the South could strike back. But Jenny Town, from the US-based think tank 38 North, challenges the assumption that a nuclear-armed South would make the North less adventurous. ""More nuclear weapons does not make the world safer from nuclear use,"" she said. ""If you look at India and Pakistan as an example, this is not what we have seen. If anything, being nuclear-armed has sort of given them both the green light to go a little further."" A nuclear-armed South Korea is absolutely not what Washington wants. Yet, this beast is partly of America's making. In 2016, then-President Donald Trump accused South Korea of free-riding. He threatened to make Seoul pay for the US troops stationed on its soil, or else he would withdraw them. The fear those words instilled in people has not lessened with time. An increasing number of South Koreans, acutely aware that America's promises are only as good as its next leader, now favour building the bomb. On a recent Sunday afternoon, at a local sauna in Seoul, people young and old from all backgrounds gathered to ease their weekly aches, while indulging in beer and fried chicken. While it might seem strange to discuss nuclear proliferation in such a setting, these days, it is almost in the realm of small talk. ""The US is not going to use its nukes to defend us, so we should be in control of our own defence,"" said 31-year-old Koo Sung-wook, who swayed this way during his time in the military. He served in 2010, during a major crisis when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing four people. ""It felt like a total emergency. Units were calling their parents and writing wills,"" he recounted. Now he worries not just about North Korea, but China too. ""We are surrounded by these great powers and walking on eggshells around them. To be competitive, we need to have nukes."" Almost everyone at the sauna agreed, even 82-year-old Hong In-su. A child during the Korean War in the 1950s, she said she was anti-nuclear weapons, before reluctantly concluding they were a necessary evil: ""Other countries are developing theirs, so I don't see how we can go on without them. The world is changing."" Another woman was torn over whether the US would defend South Korea, and thought it ""better to have nukes just in case"", while a young mother worried that Seoul's current relationship with the US could change at any moment. Washington is now scrambling to reassure its ally of its ""iron-clad"" commitment to its defence. Earlier this month it stationed a gigantic nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the southern port of Busan. But to the frustration of US policymakers, such reassuring gestures no longer seem to be working. Seoul's politicians have grown wary of being kept in the dark, unclear about what would trigger the US president to push the nuclear button on their behalf. Currently, there is no requirement for Mr Biden to even tell Mr Yoon before doing so. ""At the very least we could build in a mandatory phone call, so long as it is understood that this is still the US president's decision,"" Ms Town said. Yang Uk, a defence analyst with the Seoul-based Asan Institute, was in the room with President Yoon when he made his remarks about South Korea going nuclear. He claims Mr Yoon was indirectly pressuring the US. ""The US is so reluctant to discuss its nuclear policy with South Korea and yet if a nuclear war broke out on the peninsula we are the ones who would suffer the most,"" he said. Seoul is pushing to be more involved in the planning and execution around nuclear use. That could mean having US nuclear weapons stationed in South Korea, or to have a nuclear sharing arrangement, similar to that in Europe, where South Korea is able to use US weapons in the event of a war. A less drastic option would be to create a joint nuclear-planning group. The US is unlikely to offer up much, but knows it must deliver something concrete that President Yoon can chalk up as a win, and sell to the South Korean public. Even so, it may prove too late. This once inconceivable idea is now so firmly planted in the South Korean psyche, it is difficult to see how it can be uprooted. Going nuclear is a mammoth decision. The current international order is built on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those that threaten this order, such as Iran and North Korea, have paid a high price. Analysts say the South Korean public has probably not considered the consequences. The US could pull out of its defence commitment, China might retaliate ferociously by hounding South Korea with sanctions, and their country could end up isolated, another failed pariah state, its dazzling international reputation in tatters. At the sauna, people seemed unperturbed by these scenarios. Only one woman conceded that if it meant South Korea becoming ""an axis of evil"" then it was probably not worth it. But that is unlikely to happen. South Korea is too strategically and economically important for it to be shunned like North Korea. Most analysts do not even believe the US would end its decades-long military alliance. Instead, the concern is that a potential South Korean nuclear armament would create such a crack in the non-proliferation regime, it would cause other countries to follow. Only 82-year-old Hong In-su seemed to grapple with the dangers ahead. She quoted a Korean proverb that roughly translates to ""you fall in your own poop"", or in other words, this could seriously backfire. ""I do think nuclear weapons will come back to harm us,"" she said. ""I feel bad for the next generation."" ",1405,world,2023-04-21T23:54:05.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65333139
The apps making Indian monuments more accessible," Kolkata-based Shital Ganeriwal enjoys learning about her city's history and culture. To get her fix of learning, she tunes into an audio app and ""enjoys the places and narratives coming alive around her"". The 31-year-old is currently using Wnder - an audio app started by the heritage walks company, Immersive Trails - to learn about some of the oldest monuments and areas in her hometown in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. Ms Ganeriwal is among several history enthusiasts in India who are using audio apps to deepen their understanding about the country's past. Apps like Wnder, Augtraveler, HopOn India and Storytrails offer multimedia tours of historical places, coupled with audio narration, to create an immersive experience. Wnder, the brainchild of a Kolkata-based archaeologist Tathagata Neogi and linguistic anthropologist Chelsea McGill, offers five curated heritage walks in the city. A recording, done by specialised voice actors, narrates the history of the area to them. Starting May, tourists will also be able to undertake an augmented reality tour with 360-degree photographs. ""The inspiration for the project came from a US-based app called Detour, which is sadly no longer available,"" says Mr Neogi. ""We were planning to create something similar for the Indian market as far back as 2017. It took six years of planning and fundraising to make it happen."" Augtraveler, offers virtual multimedia tours of World Heritage sites in India. There's audio narration,  360 degree imagery, augmented reality based models that visitors can interact with and onscreen text. HopOn India has 116 tours live on its app across 14 cities. The app can be used on physical walks, as it moves the user across a map onscreen, tracking them through GPS and prompting them to pause or move on as needed at locations. There are also virtual tours where audio narration is accompanied by pop-up images of the locations. Founders of the apps say that the reason for creating them was to accurately represent India's history at various tourist spots. Many guides in India have inaccurate knowledge about the sites, charge hefty prices and sometimes have trouble communicating information due to language barriers. ""At Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, many people were not able to climb the stairs to see the interiors of the monument. Our [app] experiences can help here,"" says Pankaj Manchanda, founder of Augtraveler. He says that self-guidance devices available at monuments tend to be expensive, limited in number or are not scalable. For Mr Neogi too, cutting down the cost of accessing tourist places was important. So, walks on the Wnder app are priced at 199 rupees ($2.5; £2) for a year's access, while the app itself is free to download. But launching these apps in a new market like India is challenging and user numbers remain low, founders say. ""Not enough people were interested in the stories and we had no budget to market them. So we decided to move into spaces where people come with the intent to hear,"" says Shalini Bansal, co-founder of HopOn. So many of these apps are tying up with museums and art galleries to help them digitise their exhibitions and walking tours. Wnder and HopOn have created software solutions platforms that help museums and art galleries digitise their visitor experience. It involves leasing out their technology to create apps and websites that have audio-visual information about exhibits. Visitors can scan a QR code to access the information for free. HopOn's offerings can be found at the National Museum in Delhi and the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru cities. Augtraveler has teamed up with knowledge partners and government departments to curate exclusive tours of World Heritage Sites in India on its own platform. To ensure that they share accurate historical information, these apps hire or partner with domain experts to do the research. ""For us, the walk leader does the research to make it as personalised as possible,"" says Mr Neogi. ""We factor in primary sources of information, such the British libraries' digitised material including East India Company's documents and newspaper archives. We also work with communities to learn oral histories and record memories."" Users say that these apps are helping them explore the cities they live in in new and interesting ways. Sreejeeta Saha, who lives in Kolkata and uses Wnder, smiles when she talks about the most fascinating piece of trivia she learnt through the app: ""Fearing that the Japanese would attack the [city's] Victoria Memorial [during World War II] from the air, people covered the monument with cow dung.""

Haruki Murakami: Readers drawn to enigmatic appeal of Japanese author," Throngs of fans joined late night queues outside bookstores across Japan last week, eager to lay their hands on Haruki Murakami's new novel - his first in six years. At one Tokyo bookstore, which hung a two-storey LED banner counting down the time to release, copies of The City And Its Uncertain Walls were snapped up at midnight. Many readers dived straight in upon getting their copy. Pictures online showed readers curled up in all-night cafes, with cups of coffee by their side. The new novel, which the 74-year-old wrote in isolation during the pandemic, follows the protagonist's journey into a city surrounded by high walls. The 661-page read is divided into three parts, in which the protagonist moves from his teenage years into middle age. But plot is perhaps the least important element in Murakami's novels which are known for their meandering magical-realist storylines. For many readers, the plot points are merely jumping-off points for explorations of loss, isolation, identity and increasingly, social and political events. The latest book was written during the pandemic. ""I started writing this novel in early March 2020, when the coronavirus started raging in Japan, and it took me almost three years to finish,"" Murakami said in the book's statement issued by his publisher Shinchosha. He hardly went out or took long trips during those years, he said. ""In this quite extraordinary, tense environment, I diligently wrote this piece, as if a 'dreamreader' reads 'old dreams' in a library,"" he added. It is that kind of enigmatic line that sends his legion of fans around the world into frenzy. In anticipation of the book's release, a bookstore in Nagoya city put up a capsule machine dispensing sentences from his novels. Six years isn't the longest time between books, and Murakami has been prolific over a four-decade career. He's produced at least 14 novels and several short-story collections with works translated into more than 50 languages. But the overwhelming reception to his latest book reflects his enduring popularity, particularly in his homeland. One longtime Murakami reader, Yu, told the BBC the appeal of his works is how he connects the ""two worlds"" of dreams and reality. ""Sometimes they are 'me' and sometimes they are 'not me', and that creates a sense of absorption. For me, his novels are like warm and soft mud. You get comfortably drawn and absorbed into these stories,"" she said. The 36-year-old read the entirety of the new book in one sitting on Thursday, the day after it was released. She attacked it with the same enthusiasm as when she first picked up a Murakami work more than 20 years ago, at the recommendation of her primary school teacher. Part of the joy of picking up a Murakami book is sinking into a world of established motifs, readers have said. Murakami tropes are so well known they even inspired a bingo cartoon, published in the NY Times' Sunday Book Review in 2014. Murakami bingo includes an ""ear fetish, a ""mysterious woman"" or ""faceless villain"", ""urban ennui"", ""Tokyo at night""  and various supernatural spookiness and things vanishing. ""I think Murakami's worlds sit so well with many people across the world because he is beyond culture in a way,"" said Gitte Marianne Hansen, a lecturer in Japanese Studies at Newcastle University. ""His stories speak to the core of humanity in our inner modern lives and this is what we respond to as readers. The core feeling of loneliness and alienation is probably beyond culture,"" said Dr Hansen, who has translated Mr Murakami's short stories. However, the author has been increasingly criticised for his portrayal of women. Critics say female characters in Mr Murakami's books are often sexualised or defined only in relation to the male protagonists. Mr Murakami himself said in a 2004 interview with The Paris Review: ""If the sex is good... Your injury will be healed, your imagination will be invigorated... In that sense, in my stories, women are mediums - harbingers of the coming world. That's why they always come to my protagonist; he doesn't go to them."" This is simply ""the male voice that [Mr Murakami] privileges"", says Michael Tsang, a Japanese Studies lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. His dominance illustrates that Japan ""needs to do more about gender and other minority groups."" But for some, the misogyny in Mr Murakami's works is hard to overlook, and that could be one reason as to why literature's biggest honour has eluded him for so many years. ""Hello Japan's pundits, Haruki Murakami will not get a Nobel prize unless he gets rid of all his misogyny... Pin your hopes on a better Japanese writer,"" one Twitter user argued. ""The sexualisation of an underage girl, as well as detailed descriptions of the voluptuousness of her body, can be considered problematic per today's literary context,"" said Koichiro Sukegawa, a Japanese literature professor at Gifu Women's University. The new book is a radical rewrite of his novella of the same name, first published in a magazine in 1980. The author said he believed more could be mined from the material. Mr Murakami's writing has always been seen to offer a ""cool, Japanese culture that is exported to the rest of the world, said Dr Hansen. Much of his work can be read against the backdrop of the Japanese economic recessions in the 1980s and 1990s. But it doesn't preclude readers from other cultures from understanding him. ""In fact, it is remarkable that his work can reach such a wide readership despite being set mostly in Japan and speaking to a very 'Japanese' social fabric,"" said Dr Tsang. His short story Sleep, published in 1993 about a housewife who struggles to go to bed at night, was viewed as a response to Japanese family and gender norms. He has also written and spoken about the nuclear disasters and earthquakes that have ravaged Japan. Mr Murakami's works have also inspired other forms of  art. The Oscar-winning film Japanese film Drive My Car was based on several of the author's short stories, including one of the same title. His latest book has flown off the shelves. Shinchosha announced an initial print run of 300,000 copies and had sold more than half by the end of the first week. On Wednesday they announced a second re-print. Two volumes of his previous novel Killing Commendatore, published in February 2017, saw 700,000 and 600,000 orders respectively. An English translation of Mr Murakami's newest title will be made available later this year. ",1082,world,2023-04-21T23:48:47.000Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65259722
Naroda Gam massacre: India court acquits all accused in 2002 Gujarat riots case," An Indian court has acquitted 68 people accused for the murder of 11 Muslims  in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The killings occurred after violence broke out in Naroda Gam district of Ahmedabad city on February 28, 2002. Of 86 accused, 17 died and one was discharged since the hearing first began in 2009. Those tried in the case included former state minister Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi, a former leader of the right-wing Hindu group Bajrang Dal. The verdict was delivered amid tight security outside the court in Ahmedabad in Gujarat state. Family members of those acquitted welcomed the verdict with chants of Jai Shri Ram (Hail Lord Ram) and Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Victory to Mother India), local media reported. Public prosecutor Gaurang Vyas told the Indian Express newspaper that the prosecution would send the verdict to the state's legal department, which would decide whether or not to appeal it in a higher court. Kodnani, a former minister of the ruling BJP, was also an accused in a case in which 97 people were killed in the 2002 riots. She was convicted but later freed by a higher court. The riots in Gujarat left more than 1,000 people dead, mostly Muslims. The rioting began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a train fire blamed on Muslims in the town of Godhra. The violence was among India's worst outbreaks of unrest. BBC News India is now on YouTube. Click here to subscribe and watch our documentaries, explainers and features.

India history debate after chapter on Mughals dropped," The deletion of a chapter on Mughal rulers from Indian school textbooks has reignited a debate on how history should be taught to schoolchildren. The discussion was sparked by the publication of a new set of textbooks by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), an autonomous organisation under the federal education ministry. The NCERT oversees syllabus changes and textbook content for children taking exams under the government-run Central Board of Secondary Education. Other changes include the removal of some references to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and the 2002 riots in Gujarat state. NCERT has said that the changes, which were first announced last year as part of a syllabus ""rationalisation"" exercise, wouldn't affect knowledge but instead reduce the load on children after the Covid-19 pandemic. But critics argue that the omissions are worrying and will affect the students' understanding of their country. They are particularly alarmed at the removal of references to the Mughal dynasty and accuse the NCERT of erasing portions of history that Hindu right-wing groups have campaigned against for years. Many right-wing activists and historians view the Mughals - who ruled large swathes of the Indian subcontinent for centuries - as foreign invaders who plundered Indian lands and corrupted the country's Hindu civilisation. ""Students are learning about our nation's history in a deeply divided time. By removing what is uncomfortable or seen as inconvenient we are not encouraging them to think critically,"" says Hilal Ahmed, who works on political Islam and teaches at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies. Supporters of the exercise argue that some degree of course correction in school history textbooks is necessary because these books gave too much importance to Muslim rulers. ""The Mughal rule was one of the bloodiest periods in Indian history,"" says Makhan Lal, a historian and academic who has written many chapters for NCERT textbooks. ""Can't we write more about Vijay Nagar empire or the Cholas or the Pandyas instead?"" he asks, referring to Hindu dynasties that ruled southern India. Others, however, say this is an oversimplified and reductive understanding of India's syncretic past. ""What is happening now is a suggestion that the Mughals were peculiarly violent  - when in fact violence was part of kingship as an institution everywhere - and that they saw themselves primarily as Muslims, determined to torment Hindus,"" says historian and author Manu S Pillai. ""The record, however, is more complicated,"" he adds. NCERT director Dinesh Saklani has called the debate around the curriculum ""unnecessary"" and clarified that the history of Mughals is still taught to schoolchildren. The BBC reached out to Mr Saklani for comment but he said he was no longer available for media queries. Revisions to the history curriculum are not new in India - textbooks have been revised in the past under different governments. Mr Ahmed says that textbook review is also advocated by scholars to strike the right balance between content and learning outcomes. ""History never ends, it's forever unfinished and unresolved, but history textbooks must - and that's why they are constantly reviewed."" But he adds that this should not come at the cost of a larger pursuit of knowledge. The current deletions, Mr Ahmed says, throw open larger pedagogical issues of withholding information without any sense of the tensions and contradictions they embody. That's because history, he adds, is not just about rulers. It goes beyond dynasties and battles to look at administration, governance, and culture of a time. It's a framework through which a society understands itself. ""So when you remove something arbitrarily, you strip it of its context, making it distortive,"" Prof Ahmed says. The chapter that was removed appeared in Class 12 textbooks: Kings and Chronicles: The Mughal Courts. The 30-page text traces the workings of Mughal courts. Most of this was documented in lengthy historical accounts commissioned by Mughal emperors. The chapter goes on to illustrate how these ""Mughal chronicles"" presented the ""empire as comprising many different ethnic and religious communities - Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians and Muslims"". Removing the chapter was justified, says Mr Lal, as it ""does not have anything of historical value"". ""After all, it's just one chapter - it's not like Mughal history has been entirely omitted from the curriculum."" He adds that Indian textbooks have long understated the brutality of Mughal rule, and have given them disproportionate prominence in comparison with Hindu kings. These so-called distortions, he says, have led to decades of shame around ancient Indian culture and values. ""But Indians are now reckoning with their ancient past again,"" he says. While history is not necessarily some kind of competition, Mr Pillai says that emotional propositions such as these do end up acquiring a hold in politics and public consciousness. ""There is this stress on a Hindu history of India, consciously lumping together Hindu figures on one side, and the big, bad Mughals on the other."" But brutality, Mr Pillai adds, was not a quality exclusive to the Mughals - kings in general were violent people, and violence was a corollary to power well into the 19th Century. Besides, Mr Pillai says that Mughals also dominate popular imagination because of just how recent they are as well as the cultural importance they enjoyed even after their reign. To put that in perspective - the last Mughal emperor was toppled just about a decade before Gandhi was born; and earlier Indian nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji grew into adulthood while the emperor was still around. So we know a lot more about the Mughals, he says, simply because they were more recent - and records of their time exist in great abundance compared with, say, the Cholas who dissolved by the 13th Century. ""Perhaps it is these complexities that students should read about, instead of entirely erasing segments from textbooks,"" Mr Pillai adds. Mr Ahmed says it is ironic that a colonial view of Indian history where ancient is seen as a Hindu past and medieval is seen as a Muslim one is being reiterated by some. ""You are reducing India's overlapping cultures and religions into a mere insider vs outsider debate, when the past is actually a lot more complicated,"" he says. He adds that if key portions of history are removed this arbitrarily, then there would be ""a void"" in formal education. ""And it would result in a learning of a very different kind.""

China: Dalai Lama furore reignites Tibet 'slave' controversy," An online backlash to the Dalai Lama has rejuvenated a long-running controversy over Tibetan history and boosted a Chinese government narrative. The Tibetan Buddhist leader has faced widespread criticism after a video surfaced showing him kissing a young boy and asking him to suck his tongue. The Dalai Lama has since expressed regret. The incident has sparked significant online vitriol against the spiritual leader. While much of it centres on the video, accusing him of inappropriate behaviour and child abuse, a significant portion of the criticism accuses him of complicity in ""slavery"", using highly disputed definitions seen in Chinese propaganda. There are also concerns that overall, the online backlash is fuelling anti-Tibet sentiment. Activists say that while many of the talking points have long existed online - propagated by pro-China accounts - they are now attracting a wider audience as the video controversy renews global attention on Tibet. In Twitter threads and TikTok videos that have attracted millions of views and retweets, social media users are discussing the living conditions and lack of rights held by ordinary Tibetans before the country was annexed by China in the 1950s. Many describe this as ""slavery"". They also frame the Chinese annexation as an act of liberation for Tibetans. They argue that as the Tibetans' spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was complicit, and some posts label him a ""demon"" and ""slaveowner"". But these characterisations of Tibetan society and China's annexation have long been controversial - and mirror the Chinese government's rhetoric. Beijing promotes a narrative where it freed ""serfs and slaves"" from a brutal theocracy, set Tibet on a path of modernisation, and vastly improved Tibetans' lives. It has also accused the Dalai Lama of spearheading a failed uprising in 1959 in order to ""preserve the theocratic serf system"". The Dalai Lama has said the incident began with Tibetans gathering to protect him from a possible Chinese attack. The incident ended with the Chinese taking over Tibet's government and dissolving what they say was a feudal system. In 2009, China created the annual ""Tibetan Serf Emancipation Day"" to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the quelling of the uprising. In recent weeks Chinese state media outlet Global Times re-amplified this narrative by putting out an infographic comparing life before and after Tibet's ""peaceful liberation"", in a tweet criticising the Dalai Lama. It was subsequently retweeted by at least one Chinese embassy. Though Tibet's government-in-exile has disputed the term ""feudal"", most scholars agree that Tibet's society saw people working on estates owned by nobles, monasteries or the state, and paid taxes to them. There has been debate on how to describe these people. The Tibetan word for them, ""miser"", has been translated as both ""serfs"" and ""subjects"". But most experts do not see them as ""slaves"" which could be bought and sold. ""Tibet has never had a term for 'slave'. These people were not commodities… it was like a 'peasant and lord' relationship,"" said Tsering Shakya, a Tibet historian with the University of British Columbia. Historically the Dalai Lama did not directly own ""serfs"", but as he was seen as the sovereign of Tibetan society, ""everyone in Tibet was considered his subject, much like people in the UK are subjects to the King"", said Dr Shakya. Critics of China's narrative, such as Tibet's government-in-exile, say Beijing uses it to justify the annexation and its oppression of Tibetans over the years. While Tibetans' standard of living has greatly improved, Tibet remains tightly controlled by Chinese authorities who are accused of committing violence and human rights violations. Thousands of Tibetans are believed to have been killed during various periods of martial law over the years. ""You don't emancipate anyone with [an] army and guns. You don't liberate anyone with forced agreement,"" a representative of the Tibetan government-in-exile said in 2020. Some have also argued that Tibet was already on the path of reform and did not need China's intervention. ""There were people advocating modernisation before annexation, there were seeds of change,"" said Dr Shakya. Earlier this week Tibet's government-in-exile accused China of waging a campaign to ""vilify"" them and the Dalai Lama. Its head, Penpa Tsering, also claimed without evidence that ""pro-Chinese sources"" were making the Dalai Lama's video go viral on social media and said ""the political angle of this incident cannot be ignored"". A BBC Monitoring check did not find signs of inauthentic online activity, indicating that the criticism comes from genuine sources. It also found the criticism came from diverse sources. While pro-China influencers as well as Chinese diplomats and state media were responsible for some of it, right-wing commentators and social media users concerned about child abuse and slavery have also joined in. Activists say the backlash has fuelled online abuse of Tibetans, pro-Tibet groups, and the Tibetan leadership in exile. It has also obscured numerous human rights issues that activists are trying to raise, including the forced assimilation of Tibetan children. ""There is a frustration that Tibet largely goes unreported but now is in the spotlight for this reason, and fear that this story will become the centrepiece of the conversation about Tibet at a critical time for the future of their country and its culture,"" John Jones, spokesperson for the Free Tibet organisation, told the BBC. ""In that sense, this story has been a gift to anyone wishing to downplay the concerns Tibetans have been trying to raise."" Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring and Alistair Coleman.

Moonbin: Star's death renews scrutiny on pressures of K-pop," The death of K-pop star Moonbin has shocked fans around the world - and again highlighted the pressures such performers face. The 25-year-old member of boy band Astro was a singer, actor and model. His death came in the middle of a world tour of his duo with fellow Astro member Sanha. While the exact cause of death is still being investigated, police said Moonbin ""appears to have taken his own life"". It's the latest in a string of sudden young celebrity deaths to hit the South Korean entertainment industry. Jung Chae-yull, a 26-year-old actress, was found dead in her home earlier this month. Actress Yoo Joo-eun died at the age of 27 in August last year. Sulli, former member of girl group f(x), died in 2019 aged 25 following a long struggle with online bullying. And her close friend Goo Hara, also a K-pop star, was found dead at home a month later. Not all were acknowledged as suicides. But the loss of Moonbin has renewed scrutiny on the highly competitive world of Korean show business. Known for its hyper-competitive culture, South Korea also has the highest rate of youth suicide among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising. And being a celebrity in South Korea means they would be under much higher pressure compared to pop stars in North America or Europe, according to Rob Schwartz, an Asia correspondent for Billboard Magazine. The competition is fierce from the beginning. Entertainment is a highly popular career choice for aspiring young Koreans. A survey done by the South Korean education ministry in 2021 showed actors, models and singers were among the top 10 dream jobs for primary school pupils. To be a K-pop star, most people need to go through a gruelling training period, which means they will largely lose connections with their friends and peers, and this could last for years. In the case of Moonbin, despite already having been a child actor in the Asia-wide popular Korean drama series Boys Over Flowers at the age of 11, he still needed to train for eight years before making his debut as a member of the idol group Astro. His sister, Moon Sua, also a K-pop singer with girl band Billlie, spent 12 years preparing. After numerous intense rounds of selection, only a small number of trainees make it to the stage. And what awaits them is an industry that's already overwhelmed with stars. The control from celebrities' agencies and fan culture are two main contributors to the massive stress Korean stars face, Mr Schwartz pointed out. It used to be a common case that new starts would be tied into so-called slave contracts - long exclusive deals with little control of their schedule or financial reward. While some K-pop stars have won cases freeing them from unreasonable contracts in recent years, he doesn't think the relationship between the two parties has fundamentally changed. ""K-pop stars have more control, in the sense that they are not as controlled,"" says Mr Schwartz. ""Things have changed, I would not necessarily say they got better."" And enthusiasm from the fans, amplified by the country's extremely active social media, could be a double-edged sword sometimes. ""They pay attention to every move, they comment on their hair,"" explains Mr Schwartz. ""It's crazy how they have these guys under a microscope."" Once they have debuted, celebrities are not only closely watched by their fans, but by the whole of society. In a country where disparity has long been a talking point, being a public figure means higher standards expected by the public. Drink driving, commonly considered as one of the worst offences a public figure can commit in South Korea, could easily end one's career there. Prominent actress Kim Sae-ron, 22, faced huge backlash from the public after crashing her car while drunk driving. ""Korea has a very strict moral standard for celebrities compared to other countries,"" says Korean pop culture critic Ha Jae-kun. ""If a star behaves only a little different from what's perceived 'decent', the public would attack them. And it's hard for a star to ignore this kind of assault because of the high social pressure from a strong collectivism."" Being a celebrity with mental health issues could be extremely hard, insiders have pointed out. In an interview with BBC Korean in 2017, rap star Swings, who himself has been diagnosed with multiple mental disorders, revealed the burden it could be for them. ""It's like walking around naked,"" he said. ""They say 'I thought this guy was ill, you know, how does he get on stage to perform?' They obviously don't know what's going on."" The industry is aware of the strain on their stars' mental health, and some K-pop idols have been taking long breaks for wellbeing reasons. Jeongyeon, member of top girl group Twice, has taken four rounds of breaks since 2020 due to mental health issues and a neck injury. She made her comeback last month. Moonbin also went on hiatus in 2019 and 2020, citing health reasons. Multiple agencies also have introduced therapy sessions for trainees and celebrities. Naver, the biggest search engine in South Korea, shut down the comment section under its entertainment news in 2020, recognising how potentially toxic the environment had become. But some still don't see a momentum of fundamental change coming soon. ""K-pop is its own thing and everybody would like to make it better for K-pop idols. But how do you go about that?"" argues Mr Schwartz. ""The super fans are so obsessed with these idols, it seems like a vicious cycle of being placed under microscope to perform at a high level.""
